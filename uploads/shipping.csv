Hydrogen is quickly becoming the buzzword in maritime innovation, and companies like LH2 Shipping are steering the ship toward a greener future. Recently, LH2 Shipping scored over NOK 500 million in funding from Norway’s state agency Enova to develop and build liquid hydrogen-powered bulk carriers, marking a major milestone in reducing maritime emissions.

Funding Details and Collaborative Efforts

The latest injection of NOK 299 million supports the construction of two additional hydrogen-fuelled bulk carriers. This comes on the heels of an earlier grant of NOK 237.6 million awarded for two similar vessels already in development. Together, these grants push total state-backed support beyond the NOK 536 million mark for four innovative hydrogen-powered ships.

These vessels are being developed in partnership with Strand Shipping Bergen, a company operating under the larger Vertom Group BV umbrella, noted for managing a diverse fleet of over 100 ships. The collaboration combines extensive maritime expertise with pioneering clean energy technology.

What This Means for Maritime Decarbonization

LH2 Shipping emphasizes that this substantial funding is more than just money—it’s a clear message of commitment towards significant emissions reduction within the bulk carrier segment, a sector ripe for impactful climate action. As Dr. Ivan Oestvik, CEO of LH2 Shipping, highlighted, transitioning to hydrogen-powered ships at scale signals a promising path for national and global maritime industries aiming for sustainable operations.

Context: Why Hydrogen Power in Shipping?

Shipping is the backbone of global trade, but it’s also a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Embracing alternatives like liquid hydrogen such as LH2 Shipping plans isn’t just a futuristic dream—it’s a practical move aimed at sustainable haulage and distribution. Bulk carriers moving raw materials stand to benefit greatly by integrating clean fuels, which promises to slash carbon footprints without compromising the vast logistical requirements of global freight movement.

Hydrogen Advantages and Challenges

Zero Emissions: Hydrogen fuel emits only water vapor when combusted, massively reducing pollution.

Energy Density: Liquid hydrogen packs more energy per weight than many alternatives, fitting for long haul voyages.

Infrastructure Demands: Widespread adoption hinges on developing the supply chain and bunkering infrastructure.

Safety and Handling: Liquid hydrogen requires advanced storage technology due to its extremely low temperature and volatility.

The Bigger Picture: Impact on Global Logistics

While hydrogen-powered ships might still be a niche today, funding boosts like the ones LH2 Shipping received set the stage for wider acceptance and deployment of clean maritime fuels. This transition has ripple effects across the logistics and forwarding industries, promoting greener supply chains, more reliable shipment scheduling through cleaner technology, and potentially lower freight costs linked to sustainable incentives.

MANILA, Philippines — President Marcos witnessed yesterday the naming and delivery ceremony of the world’s first methanol dual-fueled bulk carrier in Cebu, an event that he said highlighted the Philippines’ status as a major shipbuilder and its readiness to lead in the transition to low-carbon and sustainable maritime transport.

Bulk carrier KAMSARMAX SC-443 is designed to significantly cut carbon dioxide emissions by 10 percent, nitrogen oxides by 80 percent and sulfur oxides by 99 percent compared to conventional models.

Named Brave Pioneer, the ship was launched on July 17, 2025 in Balamban, Cebu by Tsuneishi Heavy Industries Inc. (THI), a joint venture between Japan’s Tsuneishi Group and the Philippines’ Aboitiz Group.

Marcos described the event as “a historic milestone for Philippine shipbuilding,” hailing the project as “a showcase of Filipino craftsmanship, ingenuity and competitiveness.”

“This accomplishment stands as an example of what can be achieved through strong international partnerships. The collaboration between Japan and the Philippines – between the Tsuneishi Group and the Aboitiz Group – brings together advanced ship design, skilled Filipino labor and a robust domestic manufacturing base,” the President said.

“It proves, once again, that what is made in the Philippines can stand shoulder to shoulder with the best of anywhere in the world,” he added.

According to Marcos, Brave Pioneer places the Philippines firmly on the map as a future-ready maritime manufacturing hub aligned with International Maritime Organization decarbonization targets and global sustainability standards.

He said green vessels open doors to sustainability-linked loans, green bonds and climate finance.

The transition to low carbon transport also fuels growth in ancillary industries like advanced marine components, coatings, materials and energy-efficient systems, the Chief Executive added.

“This achievement sends a clear message to the whole world: the Philippines is ready to lead in the global transition toward low-carbon and sustainable maritime transport,” he said.

“This occasion not only celebrates the launching of a vessel; it is also a celebration of progress and of innovation. And above all, we celebrate the Filipino capacity to rise to the challenge of a rapidly changing world.”

Marcos also highlighted the Philippines’ significance to the shipping industry, which he described as “vibrant, dynamic and growing.”

“We are one of the world’s largest shipbuilding nations,” he said.

Marcos noted that as of November last year, the Philippines has over 130 registered shipyards employing more than 11,000 workers.

In 2024, a total of 484 vessels were constructed in the Philippines, including fishing boats, passenger and cargo ships.

“This administration also remains fully committed to strengthening the shipbuilding and ship repair industry by enhancing its competitiveness, sustainability, and strategic capacity,” the President said.

Marcos cited the Corporate Recovery and Tax Incentives for Enterprises or the CREATE Law that provides fiscal and non-fiscal incentives to encourage modernization, the adoption of low-carbon technologies and higher-value manufacturing.

How Odfjell expects to shift to clean energy Odfjell has reduced its carbon intensity by more than 54% since 2008 through both technical upgrades and operational efficiencies.
""This green corridor will show how this works in action while demonstrating how value-chain collaboration can speed the transition and help meet ambitious goals,"" he continues.","Odfjell’s new transatlantic shipping route marks an important moment for the decarbonisation of commercial fleets.

The Norwegian shipping firm has launched what it calls the first operational green corridor between Brazil and Europe, a 5,000-nautical-mile route across which its tankers will be powered by B24 biofuel.

Odfjell is set to charter between 12 and 15 voyages through the corridor per year, with each voyage lasting around 40 days.

The initiative is completely self-funded, meaning that Odfjell will absorb the higher costs of the renewable fuel without support.

""By covering the additional cost ourselves, we eliminate the financial element and move directly into operational implementation,"" says Harald Fotland, CEO of Odfjell.

The B24 blend, which is supplied by Rio Grande, includes 24% waste-derived renewable biodiesel combined with 76% very-low-sulphur oil.

Bringing renewable energy to the seas

To guarantee a consistent supply of the B24 biofuel blend, Odfjell has established an offtake agreement in Rio Grande.

The Ports of Antwerp-Bruges, Rotterdam and Rio Grande have also partnered with the firm to oversee the energy efficiency of the port operations along the corridor.

""We do this to demonstrate that certified fuel, technology and infrastructure are already available,"" Harald explains.

""Through this, we show that sustainable biofuel is a viable option for deep-sea shipping today.""

Importantly, this project is not just a short-term trial. Rather, the corridor is part of Odfjell's long-term strategy when it comes to decarbonisation.

Reaction to Odfjell's green corridor

The corridor is a well-supported initiative both at Odfjell and externally. The Norwegian Minister of Climate and Environment, Andreas Bjelland Eriksen, has welcomed it as ""an important milestone"".

He says: ""We congratulate Odfjell on taking the lead and demonstrating what is possible when business and public authorities cooperate across national borders to reduce emissions.

""Green shipping corridors over long distances are still in their early stages, and this therefore represents an important first step on the path toward zero emissions.""

The transatlantic corridor builds on a 2024 memorandum of understanding between Norway and Brazil focused on establishing a renewable energy supply chain for shipping.

Knut Arild Hareide, CEO of the Norwegian Shipowners’ Association, considers the move a key development in scaling cleaner fuels.

He explains: ""That a deep-sea shipping company like Odfjell has succeeded in establishing a regular corridor between Brazil and Europe powered by certified biofuel is both highly encouraging and an important step toward our shared goal of decarbonising global shipping by 2050.""

Shipping currently produces around 3% of global human-made greenhouse gas emissions.

How Odfjell expects to shift to clean energy

Odfjell has reduced its carbon intensity by more than 54% since 2008 through both technical upgrades and operational efficiencies. The company now sees biofuel as a strategic component within its broader decarbonisation plan.

""With this corridor, we integrate greener fuel as a new pillar in our decarbonisation strategy,"" adds Harald.

This effort supports the International Maritime Organization’s 2030 targets and complements the EU’s Fit for 55 package by advancing low-carbon energy solutions across shipping lanes.

Knut Ørbeck-Nilssen, CEO of DNV Maritime, says biofuels remain one of the most realistic energy alternatives for long-distance fleets.

""This green corridor will show how this works in action while demonstrating how value-chain collaboration can speed the transition and help meet ambitious goals,"" he continues.

Harald adds that the initiative’s success depends on maintaining close collaboration across the energy value chain – from ports and customers to suppliers – to increase renewable fuel access and improve efficiency.

""It may not be a perfect corridor yet, but a solid start,"" he concludes.

The ship departed the Philippines on Jan. 15, will bunker green methanol in Singapore, then proceed to Western Australia before sailing to Europe. Through Brave Pioneer’s maiden voyage, Cargill will conduct a series of operational trials designed to evaluate green methanol bunkering readiness, understand how environmental attributes can be traced and verified through carbon accounting systems, and assess market appetite for low-carbon freight services.

“Decarbonizing global shipping requires a mix of technologies and the willingness to take bold steps before the entire ecosystem is ready,” said Jan Dieleman, president of Cargill’s Ocean Transportation business. “Technologies like green methanol or wind-assisted propulsion come with uncertainty. But as an industry leader, we have a responsibility to test these innovations on the water, share what we learn, and help shape the systems and standards that will enable wider adoption.”

Four additional vessels will join Cargill’s fleet over the coming years, the company said. The addition of these vessels strengthens Cargill’s multi-solution decarbonization approach, which includes wind-assisted propulsion, voyage optimization technologies, energy-efficiency retrofits and exploration of alternative fuels such as biofuels and ethanol.

“We know the road to low-carbon shipping will require a mix of solutions and green methanol is one part of that portfolio,” Dieleman said. “Our new fleet is about optionality and adaptability. These vessels are engineered to perform at a best-in-class level on conventional fuel today, while allowing us to switch to greener fuels as availability improves. It’s a practical way to future-proof ocean transport.”

Mr Pedersen said the politics surrounding the extraordinary session had changed the negotiating climate at IMO.
Ms Kronudd said Europe needed to adjust its negotiating posture to the current environment, while maintaining the underlying policy goal.
On the preferred pathway ahead, 69% of respondents selected “continue the discussion and try to adopt in one year”, compared with 17% favouring protocol creation and 14% supporting dismissal of the adjourned extraordinary session.
Views on timing skewed towards a longer delay: 57% agreed the delay to the NZF would last three years or more; while 43% disagreed.","Ms Kronudd said the European Commission’s initial public reaction to the October meeting had softened into a more consultative approach towards EU member states, with Brussels seeking to restore a unified bloc position ahead of the next IMO decision point.

Ms Kronudd said the Commission had reiterated that the postponement did not change the implementation of EU rules, adding: “Until we have a global agreement, the regional framework will stay.”

She said EU discussions had moved quickly compared with the IMO’s meeting cycle and suggested that the politics inside the bloc could now cut both ways: the Commission’s effort to bring dissenting member states back into alignment could also encourage others to seek concessions.

""Returning to an “all-or-nothing” decision environment risked repeating the breakdown""

Ms Kronudd said the Commission had been working on “a single monitoring, reporting and verification framework” intended to cover both the EU ETS and FuelEU Maritime reporting, with proposals expected in Q3 2026, followed by further changes on FuelEU Maritime compliance in 2027.

Ms Scheiris described the October extraordinary session as politically charged and said the adjournment vote had deferred adoption for a year without resolving foundational disagreements.

She said the session had exposed disputes over procedural routes to adoption, governance of the proposed net-zero fund, regulatory fragmentation and the distribution of compliance costs along the value chain.

Ms Scheiris said that, in her view, the industry still wanted “a good, single, global solution”, but that elements of the NZF needed clarification to build consensus.

She said the sustainable fuel certification scheme and life-cycle assessment methodology needed further detail, and that non-fuel energy sources should be recognised alongside alternative fuels.

“All the transitional pathways towards decarbonisation stay open,” she said, citing energy-saving devices, sustainable biofuels, LNG and wind-assisted propulsion as options that operators had been considering.

Mr Pedersen said the NZF that emerged from MEPC 83 in April 2025 had been developed quickly as a compromise package and had not been subject to a dedicated impact assessment before being circulated for adoption at the extraordinary session.

""48% favoured proceeding without US participation, 29% preferred negotiating a bilateral US agreement and 23% supported pausing""

He said the two-tier greenhouse fuel intensity (GFI) design and the accompanying economic mechanics created a complex compliance structure, the practical implications of which were still being tested by the industry.

Mr Pedersen said the politics surrounding the extraordinary session had changed the negotiating climate at IMO.

He said the organisation’s tradition of reaching consensus was under pressure, noting that divisive votes had become more likely and that some states were now using procedural tools that, in his view, departed from established practice: “Votes are very divisive … the normality has changed,” he said.

A particular concern, Mr Pedersen said, was that the committee had reached a point in October where the legal text was effectively in a yes-or-no adoption posture, rather than a space for substantive renegotiation.

He said returning to an “all-or-nothing” decision environment risked repeating the breakdown: “We have to be careful not to get back into that room in a black or white scenario.”

He also highlighted the dispute over whether amendments would follow tacit or explicit acceptance procedures, arguing that a move to explicit acceptance would risk creating a precedent that weakened predictability for future changes.

Mr Pedersen said tacit acceptance had been the standard for amendments for decades and had provided a clear timetable for entry into force, whereas an explicit acceptance threshold would be difficult to meet and could result in amendments never entering into force.

On engagement with the US, there had been strong opposition from the US State Department and the panel was asked whether economic opportunities, including sustainable biofuels, could create a pathway back to negotiations.

Ms Scheiris said it could be worth engaging with the US on “the more economical parts of the proposal”, adding that US production potential for sustainable biofuels and bio LNG was large and could create revenue. “Let’s open that conversation and let’s see what their opinions are,” she said.

Ms Kronudd said Europe needed to adjust its negotiating posture to the current environment, while maintaining the underlying policy goal.

She said Brussels should send an “appropriate delegation” and maintain “a basket of options” in negotiations, while remaining mindful of the EU’s climate policy drivers.

Opinion polls

A series of live audience polls during the expert-led webinar suggested a preference for continued IMO negotiations, alongside a cautious expectation that the framework could be reshaped materially before MEPC 84.

On the preferred pathway ahead, 69% of respondents selected “continue the discussion and try to adopt in one year”, compared with 17% favouring protocol creation and 14% supporting dismissal of the adjourned extraordinary session.

Views on timing skewed towards a longer delay: 57% agreed the delay to the NZF would last three years or more; while 43% disagreed.

Asked what outcome looked most likely at MEPC 84 in April 2026, respondents split between “remove the economic element but keep technical standards” (44%) and “re-establish ES.2 Part 2 with minor adjustments” (42%), with 14% expecting termination and a return to working groups.

On how to respond to US State Department opposition, 48% favoured proceeding without US participation, 29% preferred negotiating a bilateral US agreement and 23% supported pausing until consensus was achieved.

Finally, on whether the EU should proceed with unilateral measures despite IMO delays, 46% supported maintaining a climate leadership position, 31% preferred waiting for global consensus and 23% supported implementation with grace periods to allow alignment.",https://dvzpv6x5302g1.cloudfront.net/AcuCustom/Sitename/DAM/185/Emma_Scheiris_Intertanko_1200w1_Main.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 07:58:16.063638

The Philippines is ready for the global transition towards environmentally sustainable maritime transport, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said on Thursday.

Marcos made the remarks at the historic naming and delivery ceremony for the KAMSARMAX SC-443 held at the West Cebu Estate in Balamban, Cebu, known ad the country’s shipbuilding capital of the Philippines.

“The Philippines is ready to lead in the global transition towards low-carbon and sustainable maritime transport,” the President said.

He went on: “This occasion not only celebrates the launching of a vessel; it is also a celebration of progress and of innovation. And above all, we celebrate the Filipino capacity to rise to the challenge of a rapidly changing world.”

Marcos named the vessel as “Brave Pioneer,” noting that it showcased Filipino craftsmanship, ingenuity, and competitiveness.

“It proves, once again, that what is made in the Philippines can stand shoulder to shoulder with the best of anywhere in the world,” he stressed.

The President added that the country is now a future-ready maritime manufacturing hub aligned with the International Maritime Organization’s decarbonization targets and global sustainability standards.

He noted that in 2024, the Philippines constructed 484 vessels ranging from fishing boats to passenger and cargo ships.

While the official entry into force date was August 1, 2025, data collection is based on a full calendar year.
“It is important for shipowners to understand that expanded IMO DCS separates when data is collected from when it is reported,” said Fuhlbrügge.
“The expanded DCS places greater emphasis on how data is generated, making onboard monitoring capability a compliance issue rather than an optimisation choice.
Continuous measurement of fuel consumption by consumer, supported by engine performance data, gives owners a far stronger audit trail,” he said.","HAMBURG: Shipowners and managers are being reminded to review onboard fuel-measurement and data-capture practices following the entry into force of amendments to MARPOL Annex VI.

All ships of 5,000gt and above engaged on international voyages must now begin collecting more detailed operational data under the IMO Data Collection System. This includes information on how much fuel is used by different onboard systems, alongside information on distances sailed and time underway to allow fuel consumption to be assessed against the work the ship performs.

While the official entry into force date was August 1, 2025, data collection is based on a full calendar year.

“Although information using the enhanced dataset does not have to be submitted until early 2027, the obligation to generate compliant data starts now,” said Uwe Krüger, Joint Managing Director of Germany’s CM Technologies (CMT). “Separating data collection from reporting is essential, as information that is not captured onboard during 2026 cannot be produced later.”

The amendment, adopted at MEPC 81 in March 2024, does not change the established IMO DCS reporting cycle. Fuel-oil consumption data for a given calendar year must still be verified by the Flag State or a recognised organisation, typically a classification society, with a Statement of Compliance issued by 31 May of the following year. What has changed is the scope, structure and traceability of the data that must now exist to support that process.

“Ships are now required to collect more granular information than under the original 2016 framework, moving beyond aggregated fuel figures towards continuous measurement that can demonstrate how fuel is consumed across different onboard systems and operating conditions. For many fleets, this represents a practical shift from estimation and reconciliation towards direct measurement,” said Krüger.

According to CMT, a common source of uncertainty is the assumption that the expanded DCS can be addressed primarily through revised reporting procedures, rather than through changes to how operational data is generated onboard. “It is important for shipowners to understand that expanded IMO DCS separates when data is collected from when it is reported,” said Fuhlbrügge. “The first reports will be submitted in 2027, but the quality of those submissions depends entirely on what is measured and logged onboard throughout 2026, and the quality of that data.”

He added that ensuring the right tools are in place early reduces both compliance risk and verification effort later. “If fuel consumption by consumer and operating data are being generated continuously, owners place themselves in a much stronger position when the data is audited and reviewed.

“The expanded DCS places greater emphasis on how data is generated, making onboard monitoring capability a compliance issue rather than an optimisation choice. Continuous measurement of fuel consumption by consumer, supported by engine performance data, gives owners a far stronger audit trail,” he said.

“Effective monitoring reduces reliance on estimation and reconciliation and puts operators in a much better position when the data is verified, since incomplete or inconsistent datasets can result in a SoC being withheld. There could also be greater interest during port State control inspections, and increased scrutiny from charterers.”

Krüger furthered that many operators still associate DCS with end-of-year paperwork, “but it is now very much an operational issue. It depends on what happens in the engine room and on the bridge every day, not on how figures are assembled twelve months later.”

CMT says its engine-performance and fuel-monitoring systems are designed to align with how the expanded IMO DCS dataset must be generated in practice. By capturing fuel consumption at the level of individual engines and other consumers, and linking that data to operating conditions, such systems provide a structured, auditable foundation that supports expanded DCS requirements alongside existing regulatory schemes.

“The objective is not simply to report more data, but to create reliable data in the first place,” Krüger said. “Operators that focus on measurement and data integrity will find their 2027 submission processes far more straightforward. Frequent and effective engine monitoring and data capture also helps crews optimise reduce fuel consumption, emissions and costs.”

With expanded IMO DCS data collection now underway, CMT is advising shipowners and technical managers to treat 2026 as a preparation and validation year, ensuring that onboard systems, procedures and verification pathways are aligned well in advance of the first submissions under the enhanced framework.",https://indiashippingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/CMT.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 07:58:21.545918

They are currently three to four times more expensive than conventional fossil fuels.

The devil is in the details

Despite the delay, discussions over the framework’s implementation guidelines, which govern how it would operate, continue. Many are hopeful that outstanding issues could be addressed through these discussions.

However, the rules are not easy to develop.

Take, for example, guidelines on how to assess the greenhouse gas intensity of marine fuels throughout their lifecycles. The guidelines essentially determine which fuel can be used to comply with the targets. As they currently stand, they would encourage ships to initially rely on biofuels, specifically renewable diesel made from used cooking oil. That is according to a study by the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT), which has also determined that demand will outstrip supply of such fuel after 2032.

That shortage would eventually push the sector toward biofuels made from fresh vegetable oils. A rising demand for virgin oil could displace food production and lead to cropland expansion. The result would be the cutting down of forests and thus more emissions, states the study.

The guidelines haven’t yet accounted for these indirect land-use change (ILUC) emissions, which occur outside the direct supply chain of the biofuels. Adding safeguards to limit the use of biofuels that incur ILUC emissions would better support the uptake of fuels with no or close-to zero emissions, if the framework is adopted in October.

Building readiness in China

Although China voted to delay adoption, it’s still in the country’s interest to prepare its domestic industry for the inevitable transition.

Internationally, China could directly benefit from becoming a refuelling, or “bunkering”, hub for future sustainable marine fuel. Not currently one of the world’s largest such hubs, it could leapfrog some of the competition by supplying sustainable marine fuel. China is especially well-positioned to supply the likes of methanol and ammonia, which require cheap renewable electricity to synthesise.

But building out fuel production and bunkering infrastructure takes time. And it is hard to justify investment without sufficient demand signal. As such, delaying the IMO framework isn’t helping. Production of fuels and infrastructure need boosting in tandem. Otherwise, new fuel storage tanks and pipelines could end up filled with fossil fuels.

That said, leading ports in China – especially those that have already positioned themselves to become major bunkering ports – are already acting. In 2025, Shanghai’s port completed the nation’s first ship-to-ship methanol bunkering. And the port of Tianjin completed the first methanol bunkering for a car-carrier ship; while that ship was on its maiden voyage to Hong Kong, the government announced it will provide tax incentives for outbound ships using methanol as fuel.

The industry is also taking actions to support this development, with an initial focus on supplying the European market. In February 2025, the China Biomass Energy Industry Promotion Association released voluntary standards for “renewable methanol”. The standards use the term as an umbrella to differentiate gas made using biomass and electricity from gas made using fossil energy.

The standard classifies renewable methanol into three grades, based on the intensity of its greenhouse gas emissions from production to use. Grade A aligns with the European Union’s standard, which is designed to increase the bloc’s renewable energy use. The move has paved the way for renewable methanol produced in China to sell on the European market.

Potential support from net-zero fund

Payments made under the framework will be used to create a net-zero fund that rewards low-emission ships and helps developing nations to transition. China, among other nations, could qualify for such support.",https://eco-business.imgix.net/ebmedia/fileuploads/zheng-xue-SoAe5dQiQ4c-unsplash.jpg?fit=crop&h=801&ixlib=django-1.2.0&q=85&w=1200,N,,2026-01-15 03:57:30.652501

Toyota Motor Europe (TME) reduced its Scope 3 emissions by more than 22,000 tonnes of CO2e last year through bunkering of low-carbon fuels under United European Car Carriers’ (UECC) Sail for Change fuel-switch programme – and is set to more than double these savings in 2025. The reduction of 22,148 tonnes of CO2e – equivalent to the climate effect of growing 366,215 tree seedlings over 10 years – was achieved with transport of 54,991 vehicles on UECC vessels over the five-month period from August to December 2024.

Independent third-party verifier EnviroSense has validated the emissions saving as compliant with the EU’s RED II sustainability criteria for sourcing of marine fuels – covering agricultural biomass, as well as bio-waste and residue feedstock – to corroborate TME’s carbon footprint for ESG reporting. The certificate of verification was presented recently by UECC’s Chief Operating Officer Per Christian Mørk to TME’s Vice President Supply Chain, Jean Christophe Deville, and Head of Raw Material, Indirect and Logistics Purchasing, Rosemary Lister, at the TME head office in Brussels.

Towards carbon-neutral shipments

Mørk said UECC’s more than 30-year collaboration with TME has “grown into a cornerstone of sustainable logistics”, with UECC now transporting close to 200,000 vehicles for Toyota annually. He disclosed that TME is on course to achieve an even higher emissions reduction of 57,448 tonnes of CO2e this year on UECC shipments of vehicles from Toyota manufacturing plants in Turkey and the Czech Republic to ports in Northern Europe.

“These are not merely numbers; they represent a shared vision and a joint responsibility to create a cleaner, more sustainable future for our industry and our planet,” he stated.

TME was among the first of several major automotive OEMs to sign up for the Sail for Change initiative that focuses on transport of vehicles on UECC’s Pure Car and Truck Carriers (PCTCs) using both biofuels and liquefied biomethane (or bioLNG). Launched last year, the initiative has seen an exponential expansion in cargo volumes to fuel emissions reductions for participants.

“TME’s commitment has yielded tangible and impressive results. Together, we are setting a benchmark for lower carbon-intensive transportation and proving that collaboration can drive meaningful change,” Mørk added.

Decarbonisation of logistics

TME aims to reduce CO2 emissions from its supply chain through decarbonisation of maritime and other logistics.

“The significant emissions reduction achieved in 2024 represents a big step forward in our efforts to reduce the carbon footprint of our logistics and underpins the value of our partnership with UECC in realising common sustainability goals,” said TME’s Deville.

TME is among 11 leading automotive manufacturers engaged in the Drive Sustainability initiative to boost sustainability efforts across the supply chain by developing common standards and compliance criteria for suppliers that include carbon neutrality.

“We are dependent on business partners with a shared sense of environmental responsibility, and the ability of logistics providers to offer low-carbon solutions is at the core of our Sustainable Purchasing Guidelines. UECC has shown the way by driving forward sustainable short sea RoRo shipping in Europe,” Deville said.

While the official entry into force date was August 1, 2025, data collection is based on a full calendar year.
“It is important for shipowners to understand that expanded IMO DCS separates when data is collected from when it is reported,” said Fuhlbrügge.
""The expanded DCS places greater emphasis on how data is generated, making onboard monitoring capability a compliance issue rather than an optimisation choice.
Continuous measurement of fuel consumption by consumer, supported by engine performance data, gives owners a far stronger audit trail,” he said.","Shipowners and managers are being reminded to review onboard fuel-measurement and data-capture practices following the entry into force of amendments to MARPOL Annex VI.

All ships of 5,000gt and above engaged on international voyages must now begin collecting more detailed operational data under the IMO Data Collection System. This includes information on how much fuel is used by different onboard systems, alongside information on distances sailed and time underway to allow fuel consumption to be assessed against the work the ship performs.

While the official entry into force date was August 1, 2025, data collection is based on a full calendar year.

“Although information using the enhanced dataset does not have to be submitted until early 2027, the obligation to generate compliant data starts now,” said Uwe Krüger, Joint Managing Director of Germany’s CM Technologies (CMT). “Separating data collection from reporting is essential, as information that is not captured onboard during 2026 cannot be produced later.”

The amendment, adopted at MEPC 81 in March 2024, does not change the established IMO DCS reporting cycle. Fuel-oil consumption data for a given calendar year must still be verified by the Flag State or a recognised organisation, typically a classification society, with a Statement of Compliance issued by 31 May of the following year. What has changed is the scope, structure and traceability of the data that must now exist to support that process.

“Ships are now required to collect more granular information than under the original 2016 framework, moving beyond aggregated fuel figures towards continuous measurement that can demonstrate how fuel is consumed across different onboard systems and operating conditions. For many fleets, this represents a practical shift from estimation and reconciliation towards direct measurement,” said Krüger.

According to CMT, a common source of uncertainty is the assumption that the expanded DCS can be addressed primarily through revised reporting procedures, rather than through changes to how operational data is generated onboard. “It is important for shipowners to understand that expanded IMO DCS separates when data is collected from when it is reported,” said Fuhlbrügge. “The first reports will be submitted in 2027, but the quality of those submissions depends entirely on what is measured and logged onboard throughout 2026, and the quality of that data.”

He added that ensuring the right tools are in place early reduces both compliance risk and verification effort later. “If fuel consumption by consumer and operating data are being generated continuously, owners place themselves in a much stronger position when the data is audited and reviewed.

""The expanded DCS places greater emphasis on how data is generated, making onboard monitoring capability a compliance issue rather than an optimisation choice. Continuous measurement of fuel consumption by consumer, supported by engine performance data, gives owners a far stronger audit trail,” he said.

“Effective monitoring reduces reliance on estimation and reconciliation and puts operators in a much better position when the data is verified, since incomplete or inconsistent datasets can result in a SoC being withheld. There could also be greater interest during port State control inspections, and increased scrutiny from charterers.”

Krüger furthered that many operators still associate DCS with end-of-year paperwork, “but it is now very much an operational issue. It depends on what happens in the engine room and on the bridge every day, not on how figures are assembled twelve months later.”

CMT says its engine-performance and fuel-monitoring systems are designed to align with how the expanded IMO DCS dataset must be generated in practice. By capturing fuel consumption at the level of individual engines and other consumers, and linking that data to operating conditions, such systems provide a structured, auditable foundation that supports expanded DCS requirements alongside existing regulatory schemes.

“The objective is not simply to report more data, but to create reliable data in the first place,” Krüger said. “Operators that focus on measurement and data integrity will find their 2027 submission processes far more straightforward. Frequent and effective engine monitoring and data capture also helps crews optimise reduce fuel consumption, emissions and costs.”

With expanded IMO DCS data collection now underway, CMT is advising shipowners and technical managers to treat 2026 as a preparation and validation year, ensuring that onboard systems, procedures and verification pathways are aligned well in advance of the first submissions under the enhanced framework.",http://static1.squarespace.com/static/677d25916da11d07add7c910/677e42da317bf233c28d75a0/696767fa570e5f4138475f48/1768385652147/CMT.JPG?format=1500w,N,,2026-01-14 18:57:16.715148

The PCTC Grande Manila, which was christened in Shanghai, was built by Shanghai Waigaoqiao Shipbuilding (SWS) and China Shipbuilding Trading Company (CSTC), both part of China State Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC). The delivery and christening ceremony was attended by Zhang Wei, Vice President of SWS, and Luigi Pacella Grimaldi, Automotive Intercontinental Director of the Grimaldi Group. The role of godmother of the Grande Manila was entrusted to Doris Ho, President and CEO of Magsaysay Group, a Philippine maritime recruitment and crew management company.

Emanuele Grimaldi, Grimaldi Group’s Managing Director, highlighted: “With the arrival of Grande Manila we are celebrating, on the one hand, a new and important milestone in the expansion and modernisation of our fleet, and on the other, our increasingly strong ties with the Philippines, a country with a great seafaring tradition. Filipino seafarers represent a fundamental resource for our fleet: their professionalism, dedication and reliability are values that contribute every day to the safety and efficiency of our operations.

“For our part, also through the partnership with the Ho family and Magsaysay Group, we reaffirm our commitment to the growth and well-being of this extraordinary human capital. At the same time, by adding Philippine ports to our network of services, operated regularly by state-of-the-art vessels, we will further contribute to the sustainable growth of the country’s economy.”

This is the Italian group’s seventh ammonia-ready unit, prepared for the future use of ammonia as an alternative, zero-carbon fuel. With a length of 200 meters, a beam of 38 meters, and a gross tonnage of approximately 77,500 tons, the Grande Manila has been designed for the efficient transport of vehicles (cars, SUVs, vans, etc.), both electric and powered by traditional fuels, as well as any other type of rolling cargo.

The vessel has a loading capacity of 9,241 car equivalent units (CEU), with four decks capable of carrying other rolling cargo, including heavy loads of up to 250 tons and as high as 6.5 meters. The ship is perceived to pay tribute not only to the capital of the Philippines, but to the entire maritime community of the country for the contribution it makes to the global shipping industry.

The PCTC’s name is interpreted to also reflect the growing importance of the Asian nation within the Grimaldi Group’s commercial network. Following the recent launch of a new service connecting China with the port of Batangas with two sailings per month, the firm aims to expand its presence in other Philippine ports as well, such as Manila.

The maiden voyage of the Grande Manila will begin this week on the Asia–Europe service, with the vessel departing from Taicang in China, carrying over 5,800 cars and 1,300 linear meters of other rolling cargo (buses, trucks, excavators, wheel loaders), which will be delivered to the United Kingdom, Spain and Belgium and, via transhipment at Grimaldi’s Antwerp hub, to other Northern European and Mediterranean destinations.

From Europe, the vessel will sail back to East Asia, with its return to China scheduled for the end of April 2026. Sporting an electronic engine, described as offering one of the lowest specific fuel consumptions in its class that complies with the most stringent international limits for CO2, NOx, and SOx emissions, this ship is deemed to reduce the CO2 emissions index per transported cargo by up to 50% compared to previous-generation PCTC vessels.

The Grande Manila has already received the ammonia-ready class notation from RINA, certifying that it can be converted in the future to use ammonia as a zero-carbon alternative fuel. The PCTC is also equipped for shore power supply during berthing (cold ironing), which, where available, provides a green alternative to the use of traditional fuels while docked in port.",https://www.offshore-energy.biz/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2026/01/Grande-Manila.jpg?image-crop-positioner-ts=1768405758,N,,2026-01-14 11:58:10.370880

Against this backdrop, Lloyd’s Register (LR) has released the latest instalment in its award-winning Fuel for Thought series, turning its attention to hydrogen and its potential role in shipping’s energy transition. Published in January 2026, Fuel for Thought: Hydrogen offers a clear-eyed assessment of both the opportunities and the obstacles facing one of the most talked-about fuels in the decarbonisation debate – hydrogen.

LR’s broader Fuel for Thought program examines alternative fuel pathways; including, methanol, ammonia, biofuels and electrification. The series reflects a growing recognition that no single fuel will provide a universal solution. Instead, shipping’s future is likely to be shaped by a mix of technologies and use cases, constrained by cost, infrastructure and operational realities.

A sector searching for scalable solutions

Alternative fuels have moved rapidly from niche concept to strategic necessity in maritime transport. Environmental regulation is tightening, but so too is scrutiny from investors and customers who are increasingly demanding credible decarbonisation pathways. At the same time, shipowners are urged to balance emissions reduction with operational realities such as vessel range, payload capacity, safety and fuel availability.

Today’s menu of marine fuel options is broad and still evolving. It includes LNG and LPG as transitional fuels, biofuels that can often be blended with existing marine fuels, and emerging zero or near-zero-emissions options, such as hydrogen, ammonia, methanol and battery-electric systems. Even nuclear propulsion occasionally features in long-term discussions for specific vessel classes.

Each comes with trade-offs. Ammonia, for example, offers high energy density and zero carbon at the point of use, but presents significant toxicity and infrastructure challenges. Biofuels can deliver near-term emissions reductions using existing engines, but face constraints around sustainable feedstock supply. Batteries are well suited to short-sea shipping but remain impractical for long-distance routes.

Hydrogen occupies a unique position in this mix. When produced using renewable electricity and used in fuel cells, green hydrogen can deliver zero tank-to-wake emissions. It is also a critical building block for e-fuels, such as ammonia and methanol, giving it strategic importance beyond its direct use onboard ships.

Hydrogen under the microscope

LR’s new report examines hydrogen from production and supply through to onboard use, highlighting both its promise and the reasons it remains a challenging option for most vessel types.

On the positive side, hydrogen’s climate credentials are compelling. In fuel cell applications, it produces only water as an exhaust product. It is also highly versatile, with potential to serve as a direct fuel, a feedstock for synthetic fuels, or a form of energy storage linked to renewable power systems.

But the physical realities of hydrogen are hard to ignore. Its low volumetric energy density means far larger storage volumes are required compared with conventional marine fuels. In liquid form, hydrogen must be stored at around –253°C, introducing complexity and energy penalties. These factors translate directly into lost cargo space, higher costs and more complicated vessel designs.

Safety is another critical consideration. Hydrogen has a wide flammability range, low-ignition energy and can cause embrittlement in certain materials. Managing these risks requires rigorous engineering standards, specialised systems and enhanced crew training.

LR’s own rules for ships using low-flashpoint fuels, including its hydrogen requirements set out in Appendix LR3, provide a framework for addressing these issues. The guidance covers fuel cells, composite cylinders, liquid hydrogen systems and bunkering arrangements, reflecting the depth of technical change required to support hydrogen at sea.

The missing pieces: Infrastructure and supply

Perhaps the biggest barrier to hydrogen’s wider adoption is not onboard technology, but what happens onshore. Despite growing interest and a wave of national hydrogen strategies, low-emissions hydrogen still accounts for less than 1 per cent of global production, according to the International Energy Agency.

Significant investment is needed across the entire value chain – from production, transport, storage and bunkering. For shipping, the challenge is compounded by the need for reliable, standardised refuelling infrastructure in ports around the world.

Competition for green hydrogen will also be intense. Heavy industry, chemicals, fertilisers, power generation and long-haul transport are all targeting the same limited supply. This makes robust certification schemes and transparent lifecycle assessments essential to ensure that maritime decarbonisation efforts deliver genuine climate benefits.

Under FuelEU Maritime, renewable fuels of non-biological origin (including green hydrogen) benefit from a two-times multiplier until 2033, potentially accelerating early uptake as production scales. But for now, cost remains a major hurdle.

Reflecting this reality, hydrogen-capable vessels still represent less than 0.5 per cent of the global orderbook, despite growing regulatory and industry interest.

Where hydrogen makes sense

While the report is cautious about hydrogen’s near-term role in deep-sea shipping, it identifies clear opportunities in shorter routes and specialist applications. Ferries, tugs and coastal vessels, where regular bunkering cycles reduce storage constraints, are seen as the most viable early adopters.

Fuel cell technologies particularly show promise in these segments, supported by improving cost trajectories and advances in durability. Hybrid configurations and ‘hydrogen-ready’ designs also offer shipowners a way to future-proof assets without committing fully to a single fuel pathway.

Padmini Mellacheruvu, Lead Technical Specialist in Cryogenic and Compressed Fuel Systems at LR, shared that hydrogen has an important role to play, but warned the pathway to scale will be complex.

“Progress will depend on early investment, careful planning and a clear focus on safety,” she said.

“Our latest Fuel for Thought report brings clarity to both the potential of hydrogen and the substantial work still required to enable its safe, scalable and commercially viable use.”

Wider energy transition

The hydrogen report, as part of LR’s wider Fuel for Thought series, aims to provide practical, evidence-based insights into the rapidly evolving alternative fuels landscape. The overarching message is that the shipping transition will not be defined by a single winner, but by a portfolio of solutions tailored to different routes, vessel types and regional conditions.

Dr Maximilian Kuhn, Advisor to Hydrogen Europe and ISO TC 197 liaison to the International Maritime Organization, said hydrogen should be seen as a driver of systemic change rather than a standalone answer.

“Its versatility, scalability and compatibility with renewable energy sources put it in a unique position to address the complex challenges of maritime decarbonisation,” he said.

“Yet the path forward is not without obstacles: infrastructure, regulation, safety and cost remain critical hurdles.”

For Australia, with its vast renewable resources and ambitions to become a clean energy and hydrogen export powerhouse, these developments will be closely watched. While the initial focus has been on land-based industry and exports, the maritime sector will ultimately be both a customer and an enabler of a global hydrogen economy.",https://www.ecogeneration.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/1536x1536-fuelforthought_hydrogen_resized-e1768352758503.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 23:12:12.601668

“It is important for shipowners to understand that expanded IMO DCS separates when data is collected from when it is reported,” said Fuhlbrügge.
“The expanded DCS places greater emphasis on how data is generated, making onboard monitoring capability a compliance issue rather than an optimisation choice.
Continuous measurement of fuel consumption by consumer, supported by engine performance data, gives owners a far stronger audit trail,” he said.
Frequent and effective engine monitoring and data capture also helps crews optimise reduce fuel consumption, emissions and costs.”","Shipowners and managers are being reminded to review onboard fuel-measurement and data-capture practices following the entry into force of amendments to MARPOL Annex VI.

All ships of 5,000gt and above engaged on international voyages must now begin collecting more detailed operational data under the IMO Data Collection System. This includes information on how much fuel is used by different onboard systems, alongside information on distances sailed and time underway to allow fuel consumption to be assessed against the work the ship performs.

While the official entry into force date was August 1, 2025, data collection is based on a full calendar year.

“Although information using the enhanced dataset does not have to be submitted until early 2027, the obligation to generate compliant data starts now,” said Uwe Krüger, Joint Managing Director of Germany’s CM Technologies (CMT). “Separating data collection from reporting is essential, as information that is not captured onboard during 2026 cannot be produced later.”

The amendment, adopted at MEPC 81 in March 2024, does not change the established IMO DCS reporting cycle. Fuel-oil consumption data for a given calendar year must still be verified by the Flag State or a recognised organisation, typically a classification society, with a Statement of Compliance issued by 31 May of the following year. What has changed is the scope, structure and traceability of the data that must now exist to support that process.

“Ships are now required to collect more granular information than under the original 2016 framework, moving beyond aggregated fuel figures towards continuous measurement that can demonstrate how fuel is consumed across different onboard systems and operating conditions. For many fleets, this represents a practical shift from estimation and reconciliation towards direct measurement,” said Krüger.

According to CMT, a common source of uncertainty is the assumption that the expanded DCS can be addressed primarily through revised reporting procedures, rather than through changes to how operational data is generated onboard. “It is important for shipowners to understand that expanded IMO DCS separates when data is collected from when it is reported,” said Fuhlbrügge. “The first reports will be submitted in 2027, but the quality of those submissions depends entirely on what is measured and logged onboard throughout 2026, and the quality of that data.”

He added that ensuring the right tools are in place early reduces both compliance risk and verification effort later. “If fuel consumption by consumer and operating data are being generated continuously, owners place themselves in a much stronger position when the data is audited and reviewed.

“The expanded DCS places greater emphasis on how data is generated, making onboard monitoring capability a compliance issue rather than an optimisation choice. Continuous measurement of fuel consumption by consumer, supported by engine performance data, gives owners a far stronger audit trail,” he said.

“Effective monitoring reduces reliance on estimation and reconciliation and puts operators in a much better position when the data is verified, since incomplete or inconsistent datasets can result in a SoC being withheld. There could also be greater interest during port State control inspections, and increased scrutiny from charterers.”

Krüger furthered that many operators still associate DCS with end-of-year paperwork, “but it is now very much an operational issue. It depends on what happens in the engine room and on the bridge every day, not on how figures are assembled twelve months later.”

CMT says its engine-performance and fuel-monitoring systems are designed to align with how the expanded IMO DCS dataset must be generated in practice. By capturing fuel consumption at the level of individual engines and other consumers, and linking that data to operating conditions, such systems provide a structured, auditable foundation that supports expanded DCS requirements alongside existing regulatory schemes.

“The objective is not simply to report more data, but to create reliable data in the first place,” Krüger said. “Operators that focus on measurement and data integrity will find their 2027 submission processes far more straightforward. Frequent and effective engine monitoring and data capture also helps crews optimise reduce fuel consumption, emissions and costs.”",,N,,2026-01-13 17:56:58.369496

In 2023, methanol overtook LNG as the alternative fuel of choice for newbuilds, but LNG retook the crown in 2024.
Still, in select segments the momentum toward use of alternative fuels remains.
Jason Stefanatos, global decarbonisation Director at DNV said: “The resilience of the alternative fuels orderbook in 2025 is mainly driven by cargo owners who have set their own emissions reduction goals despite market slow-down and regulatory uncertainty.","Alternative-fuelled ships maintained a 38% share of gross tonnage ordered in 2025, according to DNV’s Alternative Fuels Insight (AFI) platform, as orders by number of ships dropped by 47% from 2024’s level to 275 ships.

The fall in orders for ships using alternative fuels mirrored an overall decrease in orderbook activity year-on-year in 2025 after a bumper year for ship ordering in 2024. DNV characterised last year as one shaped by regulatory uncertainty and market recalibration, with alternative fuels holding market share primarily thanks to containership orders with some help from passenger ships and car carriers.

Clarksons released its Green Technology Tracker’s overview of 2025’s orderbook last week.

While newbuild orders overall fell from 4,405 in 2024 to 2,403 last year, contracting in the container segment rose from 447 ships in 2024 to 547 in 2025. The sector accounted for 49% of orders by gross tonnage, and 68% of alternative-fuelled ship orders, said DNV. LNG was the fuel of choice for container lines, with 58% of the orderbook, followed by 36% conventional fuels and 6% methanol. In 2023, methanol overtook LNG as the alternative fuel of choice for newbuilds, but LNG retook the crown in 2024.

The broader orderbook reflected a similar dominance for LNG, accounting for 31% of orders by GT and 188 ships by number, while orders for 61 methanol-fuelled ships was down from 149 in 2024.

Declines were seen for bulk carriers, crude tankers and oil/chemical tankers, while LPG and Ethane tanker orders fell by 73% from 2024 to 2025. DNV attributed the slowdown to “a continued focus on cost efficiency and fewer immediate incentives for owners to commit to alternative fuels”

There were a total of 24 ships delivered with wind-assisted propulsion systems in 2025, totalling 63 sails, an increase on 22 deliveries with 49 sails installed in 2024.

Knut Ørbeck-Nilssen, CEO maritime at DNV said: “While indicative of a turbulent year where strategic choices were harder to make, the slowdown in 2025 also reflects a natural reduction after several years of extraordinary ordering activity. Still, in select segments the momentum toward use of alternative fuels remains. Looking ahead, progress will depend on effective and global regulations that incentivize alternative fuel uptake, create a level playing field, and foster fair competition and implementation.”

The turbulence Ørbeck-Nilssen mentions no doubt includes the one-year delay to the IMO’s flagship greenhouse gas emissions regulations, the IMO Net-Zero Framework.

Jason Stefanatos, global decarbonisation Director at DNV said: “The resilience of the alternative fuels orderbook in 2025 is mainly driven by cargo owners who have set their own emissions reduction goals despite market slow-down and regulatory uncertainty. We see them prioritising investments where there is a strong alignment between fuel infrastructure, regulatory certainty, and commercial viability, particularly in container shipping, where LNG and methanol are supported by established supply chains and customer demand.”

Addressing the infrastructure challenges around alternative fuel bunkering and distribution, 22 LNG bunker vessels were added to the orderbook in 2025 alongside new bunkering vessels capable of supplying methanol and biofuel.

“These developments signal growing confidence in LNG supply chains and emerging multi-fuel capabilities, reducing operational risk and supporting the economics of alternative fuel adoption,” said DNV.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltdcfe6aab5515629e/bltf4f9c241129fa6ac/68357a070421c342027c3dbc/MOL_LNG_dual-fuel_VLCC.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2026-01-13 17:57:03.196629

The vessel was handed over at HD Hyundai Heavy Industries’ shipyard in Ulsan, South Korea, where it was built.

With this delivery, Maersk now has around 19 methanol-capable ships in operation, meeting a deployment target the company had originally set for the end of last year.

Barcelona Mærsk is part of Maersk’s Equinox Mk-II class, which follows the earlier Ane Mærsk class with a capacity of 16,592 TEU.

The Equinox Mk-II vessels have a wider beam and an improved design, and they are currently the largest methanol-powered ships in Maersk’s fleet.

The ship was christened during a ceremony at the Ulsan yard. Maersk has said the vessel was named by Berit Vincentz Andersen, a senior communications advisor from its Fleet Management and Technology team, in the presence of the crew, Maersk staff and representatives from the shipbuilder.

Barcelona Mærsk, designed to run on both conventional marine fuels and methanol, is powered by an eight-cylinder MAN B&W G95ME-C10.5-LGIM dual-fuel engine built by Hyundai-MAN.

The vessel is fitted with two methanol fuel tanks located forward of the engine room, with a combined capacity of about 16,000 cubic metres.

When fully bunkered with methanol, the ship can sail up to 23,000 nautical miles. This range allows it to complete full round voyages on major routes such as the Asia–Europe AE3 service using alternative fuel.

Maersk has indicated that using green methanol can cut greenhouse gas emissions by up to 90 per cent compared with traditional fossil fuels, with possible daily savings of around 280 tonnes of carbon dioxide.

It aims to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040 and has identified methanol as a key fuel in this transition.

The company defines reduced-emission fuels as those that deliver at least a 65 per cent reduction in lifecycle emissions compared with standard fossil fuels, measured at 94g CO₂e per megajoule.

Alongside methanol, Maersk has also added LNG-fuelled newbuildings to its plans to ensure flexibility as supplies of green fuels continue to develop.

The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has enacted a raft of amendments to key treaties, placing seafarer welfare and environmental safety at the forefront of the new year.

Headlining the 2026 changes are mandatory training requirements to combat workplace harassment and stricter protocols for reporting lost freight containers — measures designed to address both the human element and navigational hazards of modern shipping.

Combating harassment at sea

In a major update to the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW) Code, the IMO has institutionalized the fight against toxicity on board. New mandatory minimum requirements for basic training now include specific competencies in preventing and responding to bullying, harassment, and sexual assault. This amendment aims to dismantle the culture of silence regarding abuse at sea, equipping seafarers with the knowledge to identify, prevent, and respond to such incidents.

Mandatory reporting

of lost containers

Responding to the increasing scale of container spills, amendments to both Marpol and Solas now mandate the immediate reporting of lost freight containers. Masters of ships involved in such incidents must now report specific particulars — including position and the number of units lost — to nearby ships, the nearest coastal state, and the flag state. This move is expected to drastically improve navigational safety and the speed of environmental response.

Fire safety and

dangerous goods

The regulations also introduce critical fire safety upgrades like the Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) ban, a strict prohibition on the use or storage of fire-extinguishing media containing PFOS is now in effect for new ships, with a phased compliance for existing vessels.

New Solas requirements mandate advanced fire detection and video monitoring systems for vehicle, special category, and roll-on/roll-off (Ro-Ro) spaces, ensuring continuous surveillance to detect fires before they escalate.

Other significant amendments enforced as of Jan. 1 include:

– Lifting Appliances: A new Solas regulation (II-1/3-13) standardizes the design, maintenance, and inspection of onboard lifting appliances and anchor handling winches to reduce mechanical failures.

– Fishing Vessel Standards: The STCW-F Convention has been overhauled to professionalize the fishing sector, introducing harmonized qualification standards and a new mandatory code for fishing vessel personnel.

– Polar Code Expansion: Safety regulations for polar waters have been extended to cover smaller cargo ships, fishing vessels, and yachts, reflecting increased traffic in high-latitude regions.

– Stability Monitoring: New containerships and bulk carriers (3,000 GT and above) must now be fitted with electronic inclinometers to accurately record roll motion.

These regulations represent the IMO’s continued push toward a safer, cleaner, and more socially responsible maritime sector. Shipowners and operators are advised to ensure immediate compliance with the new standards to avoid detention or penalties.",https://www.manilatimes.net/manilatimes/uploads/images/2026/01/13/897432.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 11:57:21.142071

The Grande Manila, a unit designed to transport cars, trucks and rolling stock, was delivered and christened yesterday in Shanghai. Commissioned from the Shanghai Waigaoqiao shipbuilding company and China shipbuilding trading company (both part of China State shipbuilding corporation), this is the seventh ammonia-ready vessel for the Neapolitan shipping company, i.e. ready to use ammonia as an alternative fuel, with zero carbon emissions.

With a length of 200 metres, a width of 38 metres, and a gross tonnage of approximately 77,500 tonnes, the Grande Manila is designed to transport vehicles (cars, SUVs, vans, and so on), both electric and traditional fuel-powered, as well as any other type of rolling cargo. In particular, it can load up to 9,241 ceu (car equivalent units), with four decks also suitable for transporting other rolling cargo, including heavy loads of up to 250 tonnes and a maximum height of 6.5 metres.

The ship, explain Grimaldi's top management, ""pays tribute not only to the capital of the Philippines, but to the country's entire maritime community, for the extraordinary contribution it makes to the global shipping industry. The ship's name also reflects the growing importance of the Asian nation within the group's commercial network: after the recent launch of a new service connecting China to the port of Batangas, with two departures per month, Grimaldi aims to expand its presence also in other Philippine ports, such as Manila"".

The group has been manning Grimaldi marine partners for ten years in a joint venture structured in the Philippines, which allows the employment of thousands of Filipino seafarers on the group's ships.

""With the arrival of the Grande Manila,"" says Emanuele Grimaldi, the group's CEO, ""we celebrate, on the one hand, a new, important milestone in the expansion and modernisation of our fleet and, on the other, our increasingly strong link with the Philippines, a country with a great seafaring tradition. Filipino seafarers represent a fundamental resource for our fleet: professionalism, dedication and reliability are values that contribute every day to the safety and efficiency of our operations. For our part, also through our partnership with the Ho family and Magsaysay group, we reaffirm our commitment to the growth and well-being of this extraordinary human capital.

For ballast water and associated grey and blackwater streams, the focus is on how systems behave in real conditions rather than on paper type-approval.
Vessels should include procedures for managing such conditions in their approved ballast water management plans, tailored to the system’s limitations and the vessel’s trading pattern.
The United Kingdom Maritime and Coastguard Agency, in its MIN 706 notice, reminded industry, “The guidelines were adopted by the Marine Environment Protection Committee at its 80th session and replace the 2011 Biofouling Guidelines”, referring to the 2023 IMO Biofouling Guidelines in resolution MEPC.378(80).
These guidelines set out expectations for biofouling management plans and record books, as well as inspection and cleaning regimes, but remain formally non-mandatory at global level.","Environmental protection around ships is moving into a new phase in which ballast water, hull condition, underwater-radiated noise, plastics, oily residues and wastewater are treated as a linked compliance burden rather than separate technical issues.

Recent IMO decisions and regional rules already adopted will frame the work of shipowners and operators through 2026 and beyond.

For ballast water and associated grey and blackwater streams, the focus is on how systems behave in real conditions rather than on paper type-approval.

""Mandatory hull fouling control requirements for all vessels over 24 m""

At its 81st session in March 2024, the IMO Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) adopted Resolution MEPC.387(81) with interim guidance for ships operating in challenging water quality and Circular BWM.2/Circ.82 with guidance on the temporary storage of treated sewage and grey water in ballast water tanks.

As DNV noted, the purpose of this guidance is to assist ships to comply with the BWM Convention and the D-2 discharge standard when a type-approved ballast water management system (BWMS) encounters operational limitations or has difficulty meeting operational demand in challenging water quality conditions.

Vessels should include procedures for managing such conditions in their approved ballast water management plans, tailored to the system’s limitations and the vessel’s trading pattern.

For owners, this means ballast water planning is moving beyond installation projects into ship-specific operational doctrines that also touch sewage and greywater handling, particularly where treated effluents are routed through ballast tanks under defined conditions.

As more administrations and recognised organisations incorporate this guidance into their survey and plan-approval routines during 2026, operators can expect closer scrutiny of how crews document, decide and record contingency actions when BWMS performance is constrained by local water quality.

Biofouling and coatings are on a similar journey from voluntary guidance toward hard-edged regional rules.

The United Kingdom Maritime and Coastguard Agency, in its MIN 706 notice, reminded industry, “The guidelines were adopted by the Marine Environment Protection Committee at its 80th session and replace the 2011 Biofouling Guidelines”, referring to the 2023 IMO Biofouling Guidelines in resolution MEPC.378(80).

These guidelines set out expectations for biofouling management plans and record books, as well as inspection and cleaning regimes, but remain formally non-mandatory at global level.

Brazil is now treating those concepts as a regulatory baseline, and as Inchcape Shipping Services has reported, the Brazilian navy has revised NORMAM-401 to introduce mandatory hull fouling control requirements for all vessels over 24 m operating in Brazilian jurisdictional waters or moving between the country’s three marine biogeographic zones.

West of England P&I summarised the changes and noted all ships must maintain a Biofouling Management Plan and Biofouling Record Book and that vessels trading between Brazilian regions must maintain a fouling rating of 1 or lower, meaning no fouling or only microfouling.

Ships with higher ratings must clean before transit, using inwater methods that capture residues and avoid sensitive areas unless expressly authorised by the environmental authority.

While the permit regime took effect on 17 June 2025, West of England stated, “Full enforcement with penalties is set to take effect on 1 February 2026.”

This Brazilian timeline is likely to be watched by other coastal states concerned about invasive species and hull-derived waste.",https://dvzpv6x5302g1.cloudfront.net/AcuCustom/Sitename/DAM/179/Brazil_biofouling_regions_1200w1_Main.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 07:57:52.397450

Mitsui O.S.K. Lines,announced the signing of a memorandum of understanding for a strategic partnership with ITOCHU Corporation to advance decarbonization in the transportation sector through the use of Environmental Attribute Certificates .

Through this MOU, both companies will collaborate in marketing, public relations, sales, and other areas to promote the adoption of EACs, helping companies using transportation services reduce their Scope 3 emissions . By forming a cross-industry partnership between shipping and aviation, this initiative represents a new model for decarbonization in Japan.

As part of this initiative, both companies, in their capacity as users of maritime and air transport, have engaged in mutual trading of EACs to reduce their respective Scope 3 emissions as follows:

[Transaction Summary]

MOL purchased “air transport (air travel and freight)” EACs issued by ITOCHU to reduce GHG emissions associated with its employee air travel (Scope 3 Category 6).

ITOCHU purchased “maritime transport (sea freight)” EACs issued by MOL to reduce GHG emissions associated with its use of maritime transport (Scope 3 Category 4).

This transaction was executed through the platform provided by 123Carbon in the Netherlands. Operating under a robust audit framework, the platform centrally manages the issuance, transfer, storage, and retirement of EACs. It ensures traceability and reliability of transactions while maintaining high transparency in accordance with global standards.

Reducing Scope 3 emissions-which represent a significant share for many companies- is an unavoidable challenge in advancing climate change response. One of key barriers is the difficulty of ensuring traceability, given the complexity of supply chains. MOL will leverage its strengths in marine transport through the use of low-carbon marine fuels, while ITOCHU will draw on its expertise in adopting sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Through this collaborative effort in the shipping and aviation sectors, the two companies will establish a framework to support transportation service users in reducing their Scope 3 emissions. Together, they are committed to advancing decarbonization across the broader transportation supply chain through this partnership.

The MOL Group has identified “Build business models that enable net zero emissions” as one of actions in its “MOL Group Environmental Vision 2.2” In February 2025, the group launched a carbon insetting & book and claim program called the “BLUE ACTION NET-ZERO ALLIANCE” .

CSA is concerned with all technical, scientific and regulatory issues that could have an impact on the use of Exhaust Gas Cleaning Systems (EGCS). It supports and educates the public and policy makers concerning the availability and use of the open loop Exhaust Gas Cleaning System (EGCS), a technology environmentally friendly and effective, and economically feasible.

The Clean Shipping Alliance supported its members in the timely implementation of the regulation 14.1.3 of MARPOL Annex VI that became effective on January 1, 2020 requiring that the sulfur content of any fuel used on board ships shall not exceed 0.50% mm.

Advocacy

The Alliance advocates a rational operating environment for the open loop EGCS (scrubbers) through engagement with policy makers and different stakeholders in the maritime industry. Besides that, CSA advocates for its companies members working to reduce the marine exhaust gas emissions.

Vision

Become the main source of information regarding the Exhaust Gas Cleaning System, being perceived by the various stakeholders in the maritime industry as the authority on the matter with the ability of reversing negative decisions through the advocacy work based on scientific data and the most recent studies.

Key Objectives

Provide technical information and scientific research data to the maritime different stakeholders such as policy makers, public policy officials, the International Maritime Organization (IMO), non- governmental organizations (NGOs), European Institutions and the public on the effectiveness and benefits of the open-loop EGCS along with the associated air and water emissions. Work directly with the IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) to ensure the consideration of the most up-to-date technical and economic data in the development of the regulations.

Work directly with regulators to monitor and influence current and future legislation on EGCS.

Promote discussions with the ports and authorities that have a negative position towards the open loop EGCS, provide credible data and scientific analysis of the technology to ensure the decisions will be taken on technical basis instead of a precautionary measure without any grounds.

Rationale

CSA Members have been leaders in emission control efforts and have made significant investments of time, funding, and resources to comply in good faith with the IMO 2020 fuel requirements through the utilization of the environmentally safe and effective Exhaust Gas Cleaning Systems, both open and closed loop.

Now, after one year of the MARPOL Annex VI entering into force, some elements of the industry representatives and regulators have voiced opposition to the use of this technology alleging environmental reasons but without any scientific data to support their arguments.

In light of the abovementioned developments with regard to the general acceptance of EGCS, in some regions authorities have already put in place restrictions as a precautionary measure. Therefore, any current or future ban, local or otherwise, will not only unfairly impact many shipping companies but will also undermine IMO as the regulator for global shipping.

It is therefore the role of the Clean Shipping Alliance to engage with these authorities and others worldwide to ensure these authorities have the latest science and most credible studies for their decision-making, and have accepted CSA and its Staff and Members, as an objective resource.Membership Benefits

The strategy, adopted in 2023, aims to reduce annual greenhouse gas emissions from international shipping by at least 20% compared to the 2008 level.
Decarbonizing the shipping industry will require building next-generation vessels that can run on low-carbon fuels or operate energy-saving technologies.
Ships built there, whether China- or foreign-flagged, are responsible for nearly 30% of global shipping emissions, according to the ICCT.
With the regulatory certainty provided by the Net-zero Framework, China could calmly steer the industry along the decarbonization route.","[By Mao Xiaoli]

Later this year, member states of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) will resume negotiations on whether to adopt an agreed plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from shipping.

China had originally supported the approval of the plan, known as the Net-zero Framework, at an IMO meeting in April 2025. However, about six months later, at talks on whether to sign off the framework formally, the country sided with the majority of member states to postpone the decision for a year.

A few other member states, including India and Argentina, made the same change of position. The situation reflects how divided states are on the IMO’s measures to control these emissions.

Still, when the negotiations resume in October 2026, the adoption of the framework would be in China’s interest. As the world’s largest ship exporter and builder, the country has already laid the groundwork for greening its shipping sector. The framework would provide its industry with the stability it needs to continue the inevitable transition.

Talks on implementation rules press on

Many thought the rules agreed in the framework to restrict ships’ emissions were not ambitious enough to meet the goals of the IMO’s climate strategy. In the meantime, however, this delay has made it even harder for the sector to meet those goals.

The strategy, adopted in 2023, aims to reduce annual greenhouse gas emissions from international shipping by at least 20% compared to the 2008 level. It also aims to replace at least 5% of fuels with alternatives that emit zero or near-zero greenhouse gases by 2030.

Without the regulatory certainty that an approved Net-zero Framework would offer, industry remains hesitant to invest in fuels that have very low to no emissions. They are currently three to four times more expensive than conventional fossil fuels.

The devil is in the details

Despite the delay, discussions over the framework’s implementation guidelines, which govern how it would operate, continue. Many are hopeful that outstanding issues could be addressed through these discussions.

However, the rules are not easy to develop.

Take, for example, guidelines on how to assess the greenhouse gas intensity of marine fuels throughout their lifecycles. The guidelines essentially determine which fuel can be used to comply with the targets. As they currently stand, they would encourage ships to initially rely on biofuels, specifically renewable diesel made from used cooking oil. That is according to a study by the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT), which has also determined that demand will outstrip supply of such fuel after 2032.

That shortage would eventually push the sector toward biofuels made from fresh vegetable oils. A rising demand for virgin oil could displace food production and lead to cropland expansion. The result would be the cutting down of forests and thus more emissions, states the study.

The guidelines haven’t yet accounted for these indirect land-use change (ILUC) emissions, which occur outside the direct supply chain of the biofuels. Adding safeguards to limit the use of biofuels that incur ILUC emissions would better support the uptake of fuels with no or close-to zero emissions, if the framework is adopted in October.

Building readiness in China

Although China voted to delay adoption, it’s still in the country’s interest to prepare its domestic industry for the inevitable transition.

Internationally, China could directly benefit from becoming a refuelling, or “bunkering”, hub for future sustainable marine fuel. Not currently one of the world’s largest such hubs, it could leapfrog some of the competition by supplying sustainable marine fuel. China is especially well-positioned to supply the likes of methanol and ammonia, which require cheap renewable electricity to synthesize.

But building out fuel production and bunkering infrastructure takes time. And it is hard to justify investment without sufficient demand signal. As such, delaying the IMO framework isn’t helping. Production of fuels and infrastructure need boosting in tandem. Otherwise, new fuel storage tanks and pipelines could end up filled with fossil fuels.

That said, leading ports in China – especially those that have already positioned themselves to become major bunkering ports – are already acting. In 2025, Shanghai’s port completed the nation’s first ship-to-ship methanol bunkering. And the port of Tianjin completed the first methanol bunkering for a car-carrier ship; while that ship was on its maiden voyage to Hong Kong, the government announced it will provide tax incentives for outbound ships using methanol as fuel.

The industry is also taking actions to support this development, with an initial focus on supplying the European market. In February 2025, the China Biomass Energy Industry Promotion Association released voluntary standards for “renewable methanol”. The standards use the term as an umbrella to differentiate gas made using biomass and electricity from gas made using fossil energy.

The standard classifies renewable methanol into three grades, based on the intensity of its greenhouse gas emissions from production to use. Grade A aligns with the European Union’s standard, which is designed to increase the bloc’s renewable energy use. The move has paved the way for renewable methanol produced in China to sell on the European market.

Potential support from net-zero fund

Payments made under the framework will be used to create a net-zero fund that rewards low-emission ships and helps developing nations to transition. China, among other nations, could qualify for such support.

The country has historically focused on building ships at low prices and in great number. Decarbonizing the shipping industry will require building next-generation vessels that can run on low-carbon fuels or operate energy-saving technologies.

The ICCT has estimated that if Chinese shipyards were only to build zero-emission-capable vessels up to 2050, it would cost them an additional USD 125-444 billion, depending on fuel and propulsion type. The net-zero fund, which collects payments under the penalty-and-reward mechanism, could generate around USD 11-12 billion annually by 2030. That could potentially help to fund China’s incremental expenditure.

A successful shipbuilding transition in China would be significant for global shipping’s decarbonization. Ships built there, whether China- or foreign-flagged, are responsible for nearly 30% of global shipping emissions, according to the ICCT.

The Chinese government has already introduced measures to encourage the switch. In 2024, it rolled out subsidies to incentivize shipowners to replace old vessels with ones powered by cleaner energy. This policy could boost the development of zero-emission-capable vessels and the adoption of energy-saving tech.

Keep calm and sail on

The Global Maritime Forum, a non-profit industry platform, held its annual summit in October – soon after the IMO meeting that resulted in the delay of the framework’s adoption.

Participants left feeling “hopeful and energized”, and highlighted the important role of the European Union and China. With Shanghai hosting the next summit in 2026, we can anticipate further significant actions from the China side.

In the end, a legally binding framework at the IMO level would ensure a level playing field for the industry’s transition. It would suit China more than unilateral efforts or a “patchwork” of regional shipping regulations.

With the regulatory certainty provided by the Net-zero Framework, China could calmly steer the industry along the decarbonization route. While doing so, it could benefit from becoming a sustainable marine fuel bunkering hub and upgrading its domestic shipbuilding industry.

The new measures establish a framework for the decarbonisation of both ports and shipping. The ordinance outlines the governance structure for the programmes. Responsibility for developing port-related decarbonisation measures has been assigned to the National Secretariat of Ports, while the Secretariat of Waterways and Shipping will coordinate actions linked to maritime navigation.

The framework requires comprehensive monitoring of greenhouse gas emissions, including direct emissions, those associated with electricity use, heating, cooling or steam, as well as other indirect sources. According to the experts, these metrics will be used to define targets and assess progress in lowering emissions across the maritime sector.

Earlier in 2024, on UN Climate Change Conference (COP29), Brazil has announced plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 59-67 per cent by 2035 compared with 2005 levels, reducing annual emissions to between 850 million and 1.05 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent.

In support of these goals, Brazil’s Ministry of Transport has launched a programme targeting emissions from freight and passenger vehicles. The initiative provides a framework for reducing pollution in road transport, improving fuel efficiency, and advancing more sustainable transport solutions.

In addition, Brazil has reaffirmed its commitment to decarbonising civil aviation through an updated national action plan.

…said Walter Hong, CEO, Carbon Neutral LLC.","Cruise ships operate as floating cities, producing substantial volumes of solid waste that must be managed in compliance with international maritime and port-state regulations. Plastics, particularly mixed, contaminated, and low-value packaging materials, remain among the most challenging waste streams due to limited mechanical recycling options and strict prohibitions on ocean discharge.

As explained, the Carbon Neutral–EcoCreation initiative is designed to support compliant waste diversion by converting eligible plastic waste into usable outputs through advanced recycling technologies, operated under applicable permits and environmental controls.

The Caribbean, as the world’s busiest cruise market, generates significant recurring waste due to high vessel traffic, frequent port calls, and large passenger volumes, making it ideal for port-based advanced recycling infrastructure. Puerto Rico has been selected for initial deployment because of its status as a major cruise hub, U.S. regulatory framework and established port and logistics facilities. The island regularly hosts major cruise lines, including Royal Caribbean, Carnival, Norwegian, MSC, Disney, Celebrity, and Princess Cruises.

The initiative supports international maritime waste regulations, particularly IMO MARPOL Annex V, by ensuring vessels retain plastic waste for proper handling at approved port reception facilities. Port-based processing is intended to enhance compliance while improving end-of-life outcomes for plastics collected from ships.

Furthermore, over the next decade, Carbon Neutral LLC plans to deploy up to 120 pyrolysis processing facilities at strategic Caribbean ports. Subject to permitting, financing, and final agreements, these facilities are designed to process up to 300,000 metric tons of plastic waste annually.

At an estimated 50% yield, this capacity could generate approximately 150,000 metric tons of pyrolysis oil per year, equivalent to roughly one million barrels annually, depending on feedstock composition and operating conditions.

At commercial scale, pyrolysis oil is intended to serve as a functional substitute or blendstock for residual marine fuels, including Bunker C. When upgraded or blended to meet applicable fuel specifications, it may help offset fossil-derived marine fuels while supporting circular-economy objectives within maritime fuel supply chains.

This partnership reflects a practical, infrastructure-driven response to one of the maritime industry’s most persistent waste challenges. By focusing on port-based solutions and long-term investment, we aim to deploy durable infrastructure that operates at real scale, supporting compliance and improved waste-diversion outcomes for cruise operators and port communities across the Caribbean.

Thus, IMO has provided the following list:

Preventing and responding to bullying, harassment and sexual assault

Amendments to the Seafarers’ Training, Certification and Watchkeeping Code (STCW Code) aim to prevent and respond to violence and harassment in the maritime sector, including sexual harassment, bullying and sexual assault.

The amendments are included in table A-VI/1-4 (Specification of minimum standard of competence in personal safety and social responsibilities) of the STCW Code. They outline new mandatory minimum requirements for basic training and instruction for seafarers.

These will equip seafarers with knowledge and understanding of violence and harassment, including sexual harassment, bullying and sexual assault, and information on how to prevent and respond to incidents.

Strengthening safety through improved training and certification of fishing vessel personnel

Amendments to the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Fishing Vessel Personnel, 1995 (STCW-F Convention), together with the newly established mandatory Code on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Fishing Vessel Personnel (STCW-F Code), entered into force on 1 January 2026.

These amendments follow a comprehensive review of this treaty in order to respond to the evolving needs of the fishing industry by introducing harmonized qualification standards and establishing a minimum level of competence for personnel serving on fishing vessels covered by the Convention.

The revised annex to the STCW-F Convention provides the legal framework within which the mandatory technical standards set out in part A of the STCW-F Code are applied.

Part B of the Code offers guidance to support the uniform implementation of the Convention’s requirements, particularly for those involved in the education, training, certification, and assessment of fishing vessel personnel.

Mandatory reporting of lost containers

Amendments to the MARPOL and SOLAS Conventions on mandatory reporting of lost containers entered into force on 1 January. Containers lost overboard can be a serious hazard to navigation and safety at sea as well as to the marine environment.

MARPOL: The amendments to article V of Protocol I of the MARPOL Convention (Provisions concerning reports on incidents involving harmful substances) add a new paragraph to say that “In case of the loss of freight container(s), the report required by article II (1) (b) shall be made in accordance with the provisions of SOLAS regulations V/31 and V/32”.

SOLAS: The amendments to SOLAS chapter V (Safety of navigation), address in particular regulation 31 (Danger messages) and require the master of every ship involved in the loss of freight container(s) to communicate the particulars of such an incident to ships in the vicinity, to the nearest coastal State, and also to the flag State which is required to report the incident to IMO. The amendments also address regulation 32 (Information required in danger messages), specifying the information to be reported, including position, number of containers lost, etc.

Safety of onboard lifting appliances and anchor handling winches

A new SOLAS regulation II-1/3-13 covers requirements for the application, design and construction, operation, inspection, testing and maintenance of onboard lifting appliances and anchor handling winches.

Two related sets of guidelines for lifting appliances and anchor handling winches support the implementation of the new SOLAS regulation (MSC.1/Circ.1662 on Guidelines for anchor handling winches and MSC.1/Circ.1663 on Guidelines for lifting appliances).

Enhancing the safety of ships using oil fuel

Amendments to SOLAS chapter II-2 are intended to prevent the supply of oil fuel not complying with SOLAS flashpoint requirements (60°C).

The amendments add new definitions and provisions to SOLAS regulation II-2/4 (Probability of ignition), including requiring that ships carrying oil fuel shall, prior to bunkering be provided with a declaration signed and certified by the fuel oil supplier’s representative that the oil fuel supplied is in conformity with regulation SOLAS II.2/4.2.1 and with the test method used for determining the flashpoint.

Safety measures for non-SOLAS ships operating in polar waters – Polar Code and SOLAS

Amendments to the Polar Code, together with associated amendments to the SOLAS Convention, extend the requirements concerning safety of navigation and voyage planning to fishing vessels of 24 m in length overall and above, pleasure yachts of 300 GT and above not engaged in trade and cargo ships of 300 GT and above but below 500 GT, operating in polar waters.

Amendments to the 2011 ESP Code

New amendments to the International code on the enhanced program of inspections during surveys of bulk carriers and oil tankers (ESP Code) relate to the role of an Administration in relation to firms conducting thickness measurements of the hull structure of bulk carriers and oil tankers under the 2011 ESP Code, including audits of such firms by the Administration in order to ascertain that the firm is duly organized and managed.

Electronic inclinometers on new containerships and bulk carriers

Amendments to SOLAS Regulation V/19, including the appendix (Certificates), the 1978 SOLAS Protocol and the 1988 SOLAS Protocol, require containerships and bulk carriers of 3,000 gross tonnage and upwards constructed on or after 1 January 2026 to be fitted with an electronic inclinometer, or other means, to determine, display and record the ship’s roll motion.

The carriage requirement for electronic inclinometers should not apply to cargo ships occasionally carrying cargoes in bulk and general cargo ships carrying containers on deck.

Fire extinguishing – PFOS ban

Amendments to SOLAS Chapter II-2 (Construction – Fire Protection, Fire Detection and Fire Extinction), as well as the 1994 and 2000 International Code of Safety for High-Speed Craft (HSC Code) prohibit the use or storage of extinguishing media containing perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS). The amendments aim to protect persons on board against exposure to dangerous substances used in fire fighting, as well as to minimize the impact of fire-extinguishing media that are deemed detrimental to the environment.

The prohibition applies to ships/high-speed craft constructed on or after 1 January 2026; and all ships constructed before 1 January 2026 shall comply with the ban not later than the date of the first survey on or after 1 January 2026.

Fire safety for vehicle, special category and ro-ro spaces

Amendments to SOLAS Chapter II-2 introduce new requirements to adequately protect ships from the fire hazards in vehicle, special category and ro-ro spaces, and weather decks intended for the carriage of vehicles.

They include requirements for

a fixed fire detection and fire alarm system;

an efficient fire patrol system in special category spaces;

and an effective video monitoring system in vehicle, special category and ro-ro spaces for continuous monitoring of these spaces, to allow for quick identification of a fire, with cameras to be installed to cover the whole space, high enough to see over cargo and vehicles after loading.

Associated amendments introduced to the FSS Code supplement the engineering and installation aspects of fire protection systems in such spaces.

These include the following:

Preventing and responding to bullying, harassment and sexual assault

Amendments to the Seafarers' Training, Certification and Watchkeeping Code (STCW Code) aim to prevent and respond to violence and harassment in the maritime sector, including sexual harassment, bullying and sexual assault.

The amendments are included in table A-VI/1-4 (Specification of minimum standard of competence in personal safety and social responsibilities) of the STCW Code. They outline new mandatory minimum requirements for basic training and instruction for seafarers.

These will equip seafarers with knowledge and understanding of violence and harassment, including sexual harassment, bullying and sexual assault, and information on how to prevent and respond to incidents.

Amendments to the MARPOL and SOLAS Conventions on mandatory reporting of lost containers entered into force on 1 January.

Containers lost overboard can be a serious hazard to navigation and safety at sea as well as to the marine environment.

MARPOL: The amendments to article V of Protocol I of the MARPOL Convention (Provisions concerning reports on incidents involving harmful substances) add a new paragraph to say that ""In case of the loss of freight container(s), the report required by article II (1) (b) shall be made in accordance with the provisions of SOLAS regulations V/31 and V/32"".

SOLAS: The amendments to SOLAS chapter V (Safety of navigation), address in particular regulation 31 (Danger messages) and require the master of every ship involved in the loss of freight container(s) to communicate the particulars of such an incident to ships in the vicinity, to the nearest coastal State, and also to the flag State which is required to report the incident to IMO. The amendments also address regulation 32 (Information required in danger messages), specifying the information to be reported, including position, number of containers lost, etc.

Safety of onboard lifting appliances and anchor handling winches

A new SOLAS regulation II-1/3-13 covers requirements for the application, design and construction, operation, inspection, testing and maintenance of onboard lifting appliances and anchor handling winches.

Two related sets of guidelines for lifting appliances and anchor handling winches support the implementation of the new SOLAS regulation (MSC.1/Circ.1662 on Guidelines for anchor handling winches and MSC.1/Circ.1663 on Guidelines for lifting appliances).

Enhancing the safety of ships using oil fuel

Amendments to SOLAS chapter II-2 are intended to prevent the supply of oil fuel not complying with SOLAS flashpoint requirements (60°C).

The amendments add new definitions and provisions to SOLAS regulation II-2/4 (Probability of ignition), including requiring that ships carrying oil fuel shall, prior to bunkering, be provided with a declaration signed and certified by the fuel oil supplier's representative that the oil fuel supplied is in conformity with regulation SOLAS II.2/4.2.1 and with the test method used for determining the flashpoint.

Safety measures for non-SOLAS ships operating in polar waters - Polar Code and SOLAS

Amendments to the Polar Code, together with associated amendments to the SOLAS Convention, extend the requirements concerning safety of navigation and voyage planning to fishing vessels of 24 m in length overall and above, pleasure yachts of 300 GT and above not engaged in trade and cargo ships of 300 GT and above but below 500 GT, operating in polar waters.

In 2025, the company used around 6,000 tonnes of biogas – a tenfold increase on the previous year – which represents one of the most significant shifts towards renewable fuel in its history.

The expansion of biogas use came alongside strong growth in freight. Viking Line transported a record 139,484 cargo units in 2025, nearly 4 per cent more than in 2024, underlining the rising demand for low-emission shipping solutions.

“In this uncertain economic environment, we are very pleased with the strong results for cargo,” said Cargo Director Harri Tamminen. “They are based on long-term collaboration with our partners. Our customers rely on us, and we continue to develop new solutions for them – most recently by offering fossil-free transport.”

Overall, Viking Line carried 4.6 million passengers on its five vessels in 2025, slightly down by 0.8 per cent on the previous year. However, growth on key routes and strong freight performance helped offset the marginal decline in passenger numbers.

The Helsinki–Stockholm route recorded a 12 per cent increase in passenger volumes to 808,787, boosting Viking Line’s market share to 47 per cent.

A total of 1.82 million passengers travelled between Helsinki and Tallinn, while almost 1.95 million sailed between Turku and Stockholm. The company also transported more than 509,000 passenger cars during the year.

Deputy CEO Peter Hellgren said the company was encouraged by improving market conditions and customer confidence.

“Towards the end of the year, we saw signs of recovery,” he said. “We are immensely pleased with the growth in our share of international passengers and with customer satisfaction, which reached record levels during the summer season. This shows that our investments in service, staff and vessels are delivering results.”

Alongside biogas, Viking Line is pursuing longer-term zero-emission solutions. In June, the company unveiled its Helios concept, an electric-powered passenger and car ferry designed for the Helsinki–Tallinn route. If realised, it would become the world’s largest electric ferry and could establish a green shipping corridor across the Gulf of Finland in the early 2030s.

While the electric project remains at the concept stage, Viking Line emphasised that biogas is already delivering tangible climate benefits today.

In 2025 alone, 590 such ships were ordered, lifting the total order book to 1,942 vessels, LR said, pointing to a fuel landscape that is diversifying but still heavily weighted towards LNG.
LR’s own Global Maritime Trends Barometer suggests the sector is only 24 to 30 per cent aligned with its 2030 decarbonisation pathway.
Cyprus’ shipping community has also pushed for global alignment rather than fragmented regional approaches.
In an industry defined by long asset lifecycles and global interdependence, time is no longer a luxury shipping can afford.","Global shipping is making visible progress in adopting cleaner fuels, but the pace of change remains well short of what is needed to meet looming environmental targets, according to new analysis by British classification society Lloyd’s Register (LR), based on Clarkson’s data for 2025.

While overall newbuilding orders eased compared with 2024, demand for vessels capable of operating on alternative fuels stayed resilient.

In 2025 alone, 590 such ships were ordered, lifting the total order book to 1,942 vessels, LR said, pointing to a fuel landscape that is diversifying but still heavily weighted towards LNG.

Most of these ships are LNG-capable, reflecting the fuel’s role as the industry’s most readily available transition option, while orders for methanol- and LPG-fuelled vessels followed and hydrogen and ammonia remained marginal.

Even so, LR notes that alternative-fuel vessels still account for just 2.1 per cent of the global fleet and orderbook, a modest share given the International Maritime Organisation’s (IMO) emissions-cutting pathway.

Attention is increasingly turning to the existing fleet, where conversions can deliver faster emissions reductions than waiting for new tonnage alone.

LNG retrofits, in particular, are gaining momentum as shipowners pursue near-term compliance, not least as regional rules tighten in parallel with global targets.

In the EU, the pressure is rising through instruments such as FuelEU Maritime and the inclusion of shipping in the bloc’s carbon market via the EU Emissions Trading System, which together are sharpening investment decisions and raising the cost of delay.

However, capacity constraints threaten to slow that retrofit momentum. LR warns that global shipyard capacity can currently accommodate around 465 retrofits per year, while projected needs exceed 1,000 vessels annually, a mismatch that risks delays, cost inflation and fiercer competition for yard slots, at precisely the moment owners are racing to secure compliance pathways.

Beyond technology and infrastructure, financing remains a critical obstacle.

Joint work led by the Environmental Defense Fund and LR’s decarbonisation partners has warned of a trillion-plus dollar financing gap for shipping’s energy transition, with capital needed not only for new fuels and vessels but also for port infrastructure and retrofits.

Human capital presents a parallel challenge. New fuels bring heightened safety requirements and operational complexity, yet investment in crew training, certification and specialised skills is lagging, a gap that becomes more acute as rules tighten and new technologies move from trials into day-to-day operations.

Taken together, these constraints are slowing overall progress. LR’s own Global Maritime Trends Barometer suggests the sector is only 24 to 30 per cent aligned with its 2030 decarbonisation pathway.

The trajectory, LR argues, is no longer in doubt, but the speed is.

Without faster investment, expanded infrastructure, scalable financing solutions and a sharper focus on workforce readiness, shipping risks falling behind schedule.

The transition is unlikely to be driven by a single fuel; instead, leadership will come from those able to move quickly, deploy multiple strategies and adapt to an evolving regulatory and technological landscape.

These global constraints resonate strongly in Cyprus, one of Europe’s key maritime hubs, where decarbonisation is increasingly framed as both a competitiveness issue and a strategic test for the wider shipping cluster.

That link was emphasised during Maritime Cyprus 2025 in Limassol, where the island again positioned itself as a convening point for shipowners, regulators and international organisations at a time when global rulemaking remains in flux.

In his opening address at the conference, President Nikos Christodoulides set the tone by placing sustainability alongside safety and innovation as core pillars for the sector’s next phase, a message reinforced by Shipping Deputy Minister Marina Hadjimanolis, who stressed that the transition depends not only on fuels and technology but also on coordinated investment and skills.

Cyprus’ shipping community has also pushed for global alignment rather than fragmented regional approaches.

The Cyprus Shipping Chamber’s call for the urgent adoption of an IMO Net-Zero Framework reflects concerns that competing regimes could distort competition in a global industry, even as the EU moves ahead with its own decarbonisation toolkit.

That tension has been sharpened by the fact that the IMO’s anticipated Net-Zero Framework has faced delays, prolonging uncertainty for investors and adding complexity to long-term fuel and fleet strategies, as reported by Reuters.

For Cyprus, the stakes are both strategic and immediate. As global ambitions collide with practical constraints, shipyard capacity, fuel availability, port readiness, training, and access to capital, the island’s role as a maritime centre will increasingly depend on how effectively these global targets translate into workable solutions for owners and operators.

What emerges from both LR’s analysis and the Cyprus-centred debate is a shared conclusion: the transition has begun, but it is not yet moving fast enough.

Bridging the gap between targets and delivery will require accelerated investment, infrastructure that can scale, and a renewed focus on the human dimension of decarbonisation.

Shipping, one of the globe’s most polluting industries, has faced growing pressure to reduce emissions, but international efforts have been hindered by political opposition, notably from the United States. Maersk executives hope that ethanol’s significance to US farmers and agribusiness could help overcome resistance from policymakers skeptical of climate initiatives.

The company has already begun testing ethanol as a fuel on its container ship, the Laura Maersk, initially using a 10 percent ethanol blend with methanol and gradually increasing to a 50-50 mix. Maersk aims to eventually trial 100 percent ethanol. Clerc noted that ethanol can scale rapidly without significant additional costs, although production and certification challenges remain. “It is an industry that is in overcapacity both in the US and in Brazil, and therefore could offer some immediate scale and positive impact on the carbon footprint,” he said.

Maersk’s move comes amid concerns about China’s dominance in clean fuels, particularly green methanol, and the slow development of green fuel projects elsewhere, such as Ørsted’s abandoned e-methanol project in Sweden. Clerc highlighted that dependence on a single producer country poses risks: “Not all of our ships go to China, not all of our ships can depend on energy from China.”

Diversifying fuel sources, he added, could help break the deadlock at the International Maritime Organization over climate rules. Despite potential challenges, Maersk has benefited from strong container shipping markets, driven by Chinese exports, and continues to monitor global economic conditions amid US tariffs.

Clerc also cautioned that while container ship overcapacity is expected in 2026 following years of underordering, any market pressure is unlikely to be severe or prolonged.

With the delay of IMO’s Net Zero Framework (NZF) until 2026, global regulatory clarity has given way to a period of uncertainty. However, companies such as WinGD have taken the initiative to move towards maritime decarbonization through applicable and scalable technology solutions

The industry is at a crossroads where technology decisions, operational strategies and collective action will determine whether climate targets for 2030 and 2050 are met.

New technologies already in the water

WinGD kicked off 2025 with delivery of the first engine X-DF-Mmethanol-optimized X-DF-M engine, and adoption was immediate with nearly 100 units ordered. Midway through the year, the company took another crucial step by installing the first ammonia-fueled two-stroke marine engine on an EXMAR LPG vessel, boasting a reduction of up to 95% in tank-to-wake emissions.

Before the end of the year, the company launched the model X-DF-M/Edesigned to run on ethanol, an emerging option that combines low prices and high emission reduction potential, especially as a complement to green methanol.

Acting from experience

Although the lack of clear policies and financial incentives slows down the mass deployment of green fuels, WinGD has shown that it is not necessary to wait for regulation to act. In collaboration with pioneering shipowners, it has brought these fuels to real operations, demonstrating their feasibility and effectiveness.

This strategy based on operational experience allows industry players to gain practical knowledge about new fuels, strengthening the confidence of the maritime ecosystem to invest in sustainable technologies.

Immediate solutions for an existing fleet

With more than 50% of the fleet that will operate by 2030 already in service, retrofitting existing engines is emerging as an effective solution to reduce emissions immediately. The company has already converted 3 diesel engines to run on methanol and has implemented variable compression technology to reduce methane slip in LNG-fueled X-DF engines, with positive results on vessels operated by CMA CGM.

In addition, the company has strengthened its presence with WinGD Global Service, offering technical support, spare parts and advice throughout the vessel’s life cycle. This approach seeks to ensure the sustainable performance of fleets beyond initial delivery.

High-pressure motors for ultra-large container ships

In response to market demand, the company launched the X-DF-HPits first high-pressure dual-fuel LNG engine, designed specifically for ultra-large container vessels (ULCVs). This engine is Tier III compliant in both diesel and gas mode, using only a standard SCR. In addition to ease of installation in shipyards, it offers significant improvements in fuel efficiency over other high-pressure alternatives.

2026: a turning point for maritime decarbonization

With engines already in operation and a tangible experience base, 2026 is shaping up to be the year when the industry can regain momentum. WinGD’ s new LNG portfolio is poised to facilitate a transition to biomethane or synthetic methane, while methanol, ethanol and ammonia engines will set a precedent for further large-scale deployments.

While regulatory policies are still under construction, the technology is ready and proven. For maritime decarbonization to move forward strongly, the industry needs clear leadership, cross-cutting collaboration and a vision aligned with climate goals.

Developed by the Ministry of Ports and Airports, the programmes aim to upgrade operational practices and strengthen the environmental sustainability of the country’s port infrastructure.

The new measures establish a framework for the decarbonisation of both ports and shipping. The ordinance outlines the governance structure for the programmes. Responsibility for developing port-related decarbonisation measures has been assigned to the National Secretariat of Ports, while the Secretariat of Waterways and Shipping will coordinate actions linked to maritime navigation.

The framework requires comprehensive monitoring of greenhouse gas emissions, including direct emissions, those associated with electricity use, heating, cooling or steam, as well as other indirect sources. According to the experts, these metrics will be used to define targets and assess progress in lowering emissions across the maritime sector.

Earlier in 2024, on UN Climate Change Conference (COP29), Brazil has announced plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 59–67 per cent by 2035 compared with 2005 levels, reducing annual emissions to between 850 million and 1.05 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent.

In support of these goals, Brazil’s Ministry of Transport has launched a programme targeting emissions from freight and passenger vehicles. The initiative provides a framework for reducing pollution in road transport, improving fuel efficiency, and advancing more sustainable transport solutions.

In addition, Brazil has reaffirmed its commitment to decarbonising civil aviation through an updated national action plan.

The Global Centre for Maritime Decarbonisation’s Project CAPTURED life cycle assessment is one of the more important documents yet produced on shipboard carbon capture. Not because it proves the technology works, but because it finally grounds the discussion in measured data across an end to end value chain. For years, onboard CCS has been misleadingly presented as a simple and pragmatic bridge. Capture some CO2, store it onboard, offload it in port, and let someone else deal with it. The LCA shows what happens when that idea meets physics, logistics, energy systems, and accounting rules. The result is catastrophic and should be reflected that way, yet GCMD’s press release and executive summary present it very optimistically, and as a viable option. This framing is indicative of significant challenges at GCMD.

Project CAPTURED examined a real pilot. A vessel burning very low sulfur fuel oil was fitted with an onboard capture system. The system achieved a gross capture rate of a remarkably low 10.7%. The captured CO2 was liquefied, stored onboard, transferred ship to ship, transported long distances, and finally processed through mineralisation pathways producing precipitated calcium carbonate used in steel sintering. The study followed the CO2 through every step. Energy penalties, losses, venting, transport emissions, and processing emissions were all counted. The LCA was independently reviewed and verified. This was not a paper exercise.

The headline result from the actual pilot is a net lifecycle greenhouse gas reduction of an approaching homeopathic 7.9%. That number already includes downstream credits for displacing conventional materials. Without those credits, the value chain does not break even. Under attributional accounting, which is what regulators and compliance systems rely on, the utilisation pathway increases emissions rather than reducing them. Even when the study extrapolates to higher gross capture rates, the picture does not change much. At 40% gross capture, permanent storage delivers roughly a 21% lifecycle reduction. That is the best case for the storage pathway, and it assumes a set of conditions that do not exist today at scale and are very unlikely to ever exist.

These results matter because shipping needs deep reductions. Single digit or low double digit reductions are not transition pathways. They are marginal efficiency improvements. They do not align with the International Maritime Organization’s stated goals. They do not align with climate action requirements. They would require trivial operational changes with very low operational and capital costs to merit consideration. They do not justify adding complex systems, parasitic energy loads, new logistics chains, and new infrastructure requirements to vessels that already operate on thin margins.

The physics behind these results is straightforward and unforgiving. When fossil fuel is burned, the carbon in the fuel combines with oxygen from the air. The mass of the resulting CO2 is a little over three times the mass of the fuel burned. That mass must be handled onboard. Volume is an even larger problem. Liquefied CO2 occupies roughly four times the volume of the fuel that produced it. In gaseous form at ambient conditions, the volume is closer to 17 times. None of this is negotiable because physics. It defines tank size, ship layout, stability, and cargo capacity.

Capturing, compressing and liquefying CO2 is also energy intensive. The Project CAPTURED pilot showed a fuel penalty of about 5% to 6% associated with capture and conditioning. That energy comes from the same fuel the ship is burning. It reduces propulsion efficiency and increases upstream fuel demand. The LCA documents this penalty clearly. It also documents losses that arise because storage tanks are never fully emptied. About 28% of the captured CO2 remained in tanks as heel in the pilot, because physics. Liquid CO₂ cannot be pumped down like fuel because it must remain above a minimum pressure and liquid head to avoid flashing, cavitation, and loss of pressure control. As the tank empties, thermodynamic instability, pump limits, and pressure-vessel geometry force operators to stop unloading early, leaving a large residual “heel,” typically on the order of 20–30% with liquid CO2, lower with LNG. Another 2.4 tons were vented during transfers. These are not edge cases. They are operational realities of handling cryogenic liquids in a marine environment.

These constraints sharply limit the routes where onboard CCS might even be considered. Long voyages accumulate too much CO2 to store without sacrificing cargo or redesigning vessels around waste storage. Short voyages reduce the storage problem, but that immediately raises the question of why CCS is being considered at all when alternatives exist. To be clear, alternatives such as biomethanol and battery hybridification, vastly more commercialized already, also include tradeoffs, but the carbon emission reductions justify them.

As an example, a 24,000 TEU container ship crossing from Shanghai to Los Angeles will burn on the order of 2,600 tons of very low sulfur fuel oil (VLSFO), which becomes roughly 8,100 tons of CO₂ once oxygen from the air is added during combustion. If that CO₂ were captured and stored onboard, it would occupy about 7,500 to 8,000 m³ in liquid form, roughly three times the volume of the fuel consumed on the voyage, before accounting for the additional mass of pressure-rated tanks, insulation, and refrigeration systems. More importantly, it reverses the ship’s normal weight trajectory. Instead of finishing the crossing about 2,600 tons lighter as fuel is burned, the vessel would finish carrying roughly 8,100 tons of captured CO₂. The difference between these end states is a swing of about 10,700 tons, several percent of the ship’s deadweight. In practical cargo terms, storing the CO2 from a single Shanghai–Los Angeles crossing would occupy roughly 7,500 to 8,000 m³, equivalent to more than 200 TEU by volume. By mass, the roughly 8,100 tons of captured CO2 is comparable to 700 to 1,000 average loaded TEU on a transpacific route. Unlike containers, however, this is non-revenue payload that must be carried in insulated, pressure-rated tanks with safety spacing, making its effective space and stability impact larger than the raw numbers suggest.

That swing has to be managed longitudinally and transversely to avoid unacceptable trim and stability impacts. Because liquid CO₂ must be stored in insulated, pressure-rated tanks, it cannot simply be spread arbitrarily through the hull. Feasible locations are limited and compete directly with cargo space, ballast arrangements, machinery boundaries, and structural design. Concentrating large volumes near the engine room creates trimming moments, while distributing storage fore and aft requires multiple large tanks with their own foundations, piping, and safety zones. Even with careful placement, partially filled tanks introduce free surface effects that erode stability margins and impose operational constraints on tank management. All of this complexity is imposed to store a growing waste stream for the duration of the voyage, which helps explain why storage losses, retained heel volumes, and handling emissions appear as persistent features in the GCMD LCA rather than pilot anomalies, and why onboard CCS scales poorly as voyage lengths increase.

The logistics of moving captured CO2 are where the concept becomes weakest. In the pilot, CO2 was transferred ship to ship, then moved approximately 2,200km by truck to reach the utilisation facility. Transport emissions were a dominant contributor to the value chain footprint. The LCA reports around 375kg CO2e emitted per ton of CO2 offloaded just from offloading and transport. That number alone erases much of the capture benefit. The report treats pipeline transport and close co-location as optimisation scenarios, not as current reality. That distinction matters. Ports today are not equipped with CO2 pipelines, intermediate storage, or sequestration hubs. Very few are planning to build them. If this reminds anyone of the regular failure of hydrogen for transportation—long distance trucking of hydrogen causing significant and emissions costs—it’s not at all surprising. Both technologies have very similar downsides.

CO2 handling is waste management. It does not generate revenue unless someone is paid to take the waste or unless accounting frameworks assign value to avoided emissions elsewhere. Permanent storage has no intrinsic economic return. It requires subsidies or mandates. Utilisation pathways rely on displacement credits that assume perfect substitution of existing products. Those assumptions are increasingly scrutinised by regulators.

The broader carbon capture discourse confirms what the maritime lifecycle analysis implicitly shows about onboard CCS: carbon capture only delivers meaningful emissions outcomes when the chemistry, geography, and economics align in its favor, not when it is applied to dilute combustion exhaust on a moving ship. In my recent review of carbon capture’s realistic future, I present the argument that CCS only makes sense where carbon dioxide streams are from biogenic sources, are already concentrated, where the source sits near secure storage or short pipelines to storage, and where policy or market incentives give captured carbon real value. Everywhere else, capture is outcompeted by electrification, energy efficiency, or process substitution, because the energy, transport, and infrastructure costs outweigh the climate benefit. That framing underscores why capturing small fractions of exhaust on a container ship, compressing and transporting it long distances, and relying on downstream credits produces marginal lifecycle gains at best, and why the broader climate community increasingly sees carbon capture as a niche tool rather than a general solution to emissions.

The mineralisation pathway examined in Project CAPTURED illustrates this clearly. Processing the CO2 into precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC) emits close to 0.95 tons of CO2e per ton of CO2 processed once electricity, reagents, and losses are counted. About 35% of the CO2 entering the process is not fixed and is released. The pathway only becomes net positive because the produced material is assumed to displace conventional PCC and related inputs. Under consequential accounting, that displacement is credited. Under attributional accounting, which assigns emissions to the actor performing the activity, those credits are not available. In that framing, the CCU pathway increases emissions.

The report is careful and transparent about this distinction. It does not hide the accounting dependency. What it does not do is draw the strategic conclusion that follows from it. If a decarbonisation pathway only works under one accounting framework and fails under the one most likely to be applied, its viability is questionable.

To improve results, the study layers on a set of optimisations. Waste heat recovery is assumed to eliminate reboiler fuel use. Transport distances are reduced from thousands of kilometers by truck to a few hundred by pipeline. Venting losses are nearly eliminated. Tank matching is improved so that hundreds of tons of CO2 are offloaded per trip instead of tens. Mineralisation efficiency is raised from 65% to 90%. Electricity grid intensity drops from about 565g CO2e per kWh to under 200g. Each of these changes improves the numbers. Together, they produce headline reductions of 60% to 70% in hypothetical scenarios.

The problem is not that these improvements are impossible. The problem is that none of them are controlled by shipowners, most require parallel decarbonisation and infrastructure buildout elsewhere, and most of them are deeply unlikely. This is not a bolt on solution. It is a tightly coupled system that only works if ports, power grids, transport networks, and industrial processes all change in coordinated ways. That is a high bar, especially when simpler options exist.

Those simpler options are already being deployed. Inland and short sea shipping is electrifying. On the Yangtze River, 700 TEU container ships operate on routes of around 1,000km using containerised swappable batteries integrated into port operations. Fully battery electric ro ro vessels carrying up to 2,100 passengers and 700 cars are on order, and slightly smaller ones are undergoing sea trials. These ships deliver reductions on the order of 90% to 100% on a lifecycle basis depending on grid mix. They do not require waste handling infrastructure. They use ports that already handle electricity. They scale with grid decarbonisation rather than fighting it.

Against that backdrop, onboard CCS looks less like a bridge and more like a cul de sac. It offers very modest reductions at high complexity on routes where electrification is most viable. On long haul routes where electrification is harder, storage constraints dominate. This leaves a narrow and shrinking niche.

The distinction between the press release, the executive summary, and the body of the Project CAPTURED report matters because each tells a different version of the same results. Read end to end, the report shows that onboard CCS has no viable path to scale and functions as a distracting dead end, despite never saying so outright. The executive summary sits between the data and the narrative. It reports the key numbers accurately, but frames the shortcomings as matters of optimisation and future improvement rather than as structural limits. The press release goes further, leaning into best case scenarios and “potential” outcomes in a way that reads as validation. The problem is not that any of these layers are factually wrong, but that neither the press release nor the executive summary is blunt about what the evidence implies. When a real world pilot delivers single digit net reductions, depends on consequential accounting, and scales poorly with voyage length, that is not a minor implementation gap. It is a finding with strategic implications. In this case, clarity would have been more valuable than optimism.

What would a realistic, accurate and zero-spin press release / executive summary look like? Vastly different:

Using commonly applied attributional accounting rules aligned with current IMO guidelines, an independently reviewed life cycle assessment by GCMD’s Project CAPTURED finds that onboard carbon capture delivers no net greenhouse gas benefit and can increase total lifecycle emissions relative to operating without capture. Under these rules, downstream “avoided emissions” from potential CO₂ use are not credited, and the additional energy use, handling losses, and transport emissions dominate the results.

In the pilot, the system captured approximately 10.7% of onboard CO₂ emissions. After accounting for the energy penalty of capture and liquefaction, onboard storage losses, ship-to-shore transfer, and downstream transport and handling, the LCA shows no meaningful CO₂e takeout under standard accounting, and in some cases a net increase in emissions compared to the no-capture baseline.

Only when the analysis shifts to consequential accounting and assumes that captured CO₂ is reliably transported to industrial facilities that permanently bind carbon or displace high-emission materials does the system show a modest net reduction, on the order of single-digit percentages under pilot conditions. Achieving even these marginal gains requires extensive additional infrastructure that does not exist at scale today, including low-loss logistics, nearby utilisation or storage sites, and tightly coordinated handling systems.

Even in modelled improvement scenarios with higher capture rates and optimized logistics, improvements are in the low double digits and outcomes remain highly sensitive to assumptions and depend on building and operating a complex, capital-intensive shore-side value chain.

The assessment therefore indicates that onboard CCS is not a plug-and-play decarbonisation measure, delivers little to no benefit under prevailing accounting rules, and only becomes marginally positive under alternative accounting frameworks that assume substantial new infrastructure and idealised downstream outcomes.

GCMD recommends based on the extensive work done on this pilot that onboard carbon capture and sequestration schemes no longer be considered viable as a decarbonization approach. For its part, GCMD is terminating its shipboard carbon capture pilot efforts in order to devote more resources to approaches that have merit, such as electrification and biofuels.

The scope of the study didn’t include alternatives, so the basic choices don’t need to be spelled out, but at least mentioned. The complete failure of onboard carbon capture and the absurd level of infrastructure required to get to not nearly good enough is sufficient to make it not an option. GCMD should have said that, but didn’t.

A similar pattern appears in GCMD’s ammonia bunkering pilot, which suffered from the same narrowing of scope that blunted the value of the onboard CCS work. The pilot was framed so tightly around safe transfer procedures that its primary finding was that ammonia can be moved from shore to ship without spilling. That is not a meaningful discovery. Ammonia has been produced, stored, transferred, and transported globally for decades, including in large volumes by tanker, rail, and pipeline. Demonstrating that hoses, valves, and procedures can be designed to avoid leaks does not address the hard questions that determine whether ammonia is a viable marine fuel at scale. The pilot did not meaningfully engage with upstream production emissions, fuel cost, engine efficiency penalties, NOx control, crew safety over long voyages, port exposure risk, or the systemic challenges of building a global bunkering network for a toxic fuel. By constraining the experiment to what was easiest to prove, the pilot avoided the issues that matter most and ended up confirming only what was already well established. As with onboard CCS, the result was technically tidy but strategically uninformative, and it missed an opportunity to clarify whether ammonia is a serious decarbonisation pathway or another option that looks plausible only when examined in isolation. For anyone interested, ammonia isn’t remotely a viable choice as a maritime shipping fuel.

This matters because institutions do not just generate data, they set direction. When pilots demonstrate that a pathway delivers marginal reductions, scales poorly, and depends on accounting choices that are unlikely to survive regulatory scrutiny, saying so clearly is not optional, it is the point of doing the pilot. GCMD did the hard part well. The underlying work is careful, the data is solid, and the report is unusually transparent about losses, energy penalties, transport emissions, and the difference between consequential and attributional results. That makes the failure more consequential, not less. Having assembled evidence that strongly undermines onboard CCS as a decarbonisation pathway, GCMD chose not to draw the strategic conclusion its own analysis supports. By deeply downplaying the implications in the executive summary and amplifying optimistic interpretations in the press release, it shaped a narrative of potential where the evidence points to a scuppered ship. In doing so, it failed in its most important institutional role, which is not to promote activity, but to help the sector stop pursuing options that do not work and redirect capital, engineering effort, and policy attention toward those that do.

I had hoped GCMD would become a filter for the maritime sector, closing doors as well as opening them, and said so to Lynn Loo, GCMD founder and CEO a couple of years ago when we spoke. The ammonia and CCS pilots were both clearly for dead ends that couldn’t compete with electrification, efficiency, and sustainable biofuels on carbon reduction, safety or economics. Useful pilots would have been structured to test them, not justify wasting more time on them. The biofuels markers work shows more promise, grounded in real displacement rather than speculative chains. The challenge for GCMD now is institutional. Continuing to promote pathways that deliver single digit reductions risks delaying decisions that deliver order of magnitude improvements. My recommendation is that Loo and the GCMD Board reconsider their purpose and governance. The yawning chasm between the optimistic press release and the report makes it clear that they have backed into being a dead end promotion agency, not a credible tester of decarbonization pathways.

The Project CAPTURED LCA does not prove onboard CCS works. It shows why it it’s a dead end. The physics, the logistics, the energy penalties, and the accounting realities all point in the same direction. Onboard CCS is not a credible decarbonisation pathway for shipping. The data says so, very clearly. The yawning chasm between the optimistic press release and the details in the report makes it clear that GCMD has backed into being a promoter of dead ends that it is well funded to pursue, not a credible tester of decarbonization pathways.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini_Generated_Image_s868vos868vos868-800x444.png,N,,2026-01-11 01:11:49.260728

This commissioning isn’t just a milestone—it’s Singapore’s declaration of port supremacy in the electric era, challenging rivals to catch up.","SINGAPORE—In a pivotal move for Asia’s busiest port, PaxOcean Group and ABB announced that their jointly developed PXO-ACE-1, Singapore’s inaugural fully electric tugboat, has completed commissioning, clearing the path for deployment in April 2026. This 50-ton bollard pull vessel, equipped with ABB’s cutting-edge Onboard DC Grid and a three-megawatt-hour battery pack, stands as the vanguard in the city-state’s aggressive push to electrify its fleet of over 1,600 harbor craft by 2030.

The Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) mandates that all newbuild harbor craft must be fully electric, compatible with B100 biofuels, or ready for net-zero fuels by the end of the decade. PXO-ACE-1, built by PaxOcean—a subsidiary of Kuok Maritime Group—delivers emissions-free operations, slashing noise and vibrations that plague diesel tugs, thereby enhancing crew safety and local air quality. ABB News Center detailed how the tug’s propulsion system optimizes power from its batteries to handle sudden high-torque demands during towing.

“Developing Singapore’s first fully electric tug is a significant achievement and an important step in advancing maritime decarbonization,” said Tan Thai Yong, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of PaxOcean Group. ABB’s role as systems integrator fused power, propulsion, and bridge systems into a seamless whole, ensuring operational reliability.

Technical Backbone: Onboard DC Grid Revolution

At the heart of PXO-ACE-1 lies ABB’s Onboard DC Grid with PEMS power and energy management system. This setup minimizes energy conversions between batteries, propulsion, and auxiliary loads, boosting drivetrain efficiency and extending range per charge. Unlike traditional AC systems, the DC architecture supports modular battery scaling, ideal for tugs cycling between high-intensity pulls and idle periods. India Shipping News highlighted the system’s ability to manage wide power fluctuations, a boon for harbor operations.

The three-MWh battery pack provides ample endurance for daily routines in Singapore’s congested waters, where tugs operate near shore-based charging stations. ABB’s integrated propulsion—encompassing Azipull thrusters and permanent magnet motors—delivers instant torque without the lag of diesel engines, improving maneuverability in tight port maneuvers. Reduced mechanical complexity also cuts maintenance costs, a key metric for fleet operators eyeing total ownership economics.

“We are proud to be part of this groundbreaking project for Singapore, supporting the world’s maritime capital in its journey towards fully electric harbor operations,” noted Olli Tuunainen, Local Business Line Manager for ABB’s Marine & Ports division in Singapore. He emphasized tugs’ suitability for electrification due to predictable routes and proximity to infrastructure.

Regulatory Imperative Drives Fleet Overhaul

MPA’s 2030 mandate stems from Singapore’s Green Port Programme, targeting net-zero emissions by 2050. Currently, harbor craft account for about 5% of the port’s carbon footprint, but their dense operations amplify local pollution impacts. PXO-ACE-1’s success could accelerate retrofits and newbuilds, with analysts projecting a $2 billion market for electric harbor vessels in Asia by 2035. Container News reported the commissioning as a blueprint for regional adoption.

Beyond emissions, electrification yields operational edges: electric tugs boast 20-30% lower fuel costs over their lifecycle, per industry benchmarks, and quieter decks reduce crew fatigue, potentially lowering insurance premiums. Singapore’s investment in megawatt-scale shore power and hydrogen pilots complements this shift, positioning the port as a global testbed.

PaxOcean’s rapid build—commissioned ahead of schedule—underscores Singapore’s shipbuilding prowess, with the yard leveraging digital twins for system integration. ABB’s 140-year legacy in electrification, now with 110,000 employees worldwide, bolsters confidence in scalability.

Market Ripples and Competitive Edge

The PXO- ACE-1 milestone reverberates across Asia, where ports in Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Rotterdam eye similar transitions. In Europe, Norled’s electric ferries have proven battery longevity in harsh conditions, informing ABB’s designs. Singapore’s model, however, prioritizes high bollard pull for VLCCs and container giants, demanding robust torque delivery. Ocean News & Technology noted the vessel’s role in decarbonizing the 1,600-vessel fleet.

Challenges persist: battery supply chains face cobalt shortages, and ultrafast charging infrastructure lags in some hubs. Yet, PXO-ACE-1’s deployment will yield real-world data on cycle life and total cost of ownership, critical for skeptics. Kuok Maritime’s backing ensures commercial viability, with contracts already in negotiation for sister vessels.

Industry insiders view this as more than a tug; it’s a harbinger of electric fleets reshaping port economics. As Tan Thai Yong affirmed, ABB’s integration expertise was pivotal, setting a high bar for future projects.

Global Precedents Fuel Asian Momentum

Norway leads with over 100 electric ferries, but tugs trail due to power needs. Denmark’s Svitzer ordered hybrid tugs in 2024, while China’s COSCO trials batteries in Shanghai. Singapore’s pure-electric bet, powered by ABB’s proven tech from offshore wind vessels, leapfrogs hybrids. MarineLink covered the commissioning as a fleet renewal catalyst.

Financially, electric tugs amortize via fuel savings and carbon credits under IMO’s CII framework. MPA subsidies sweeten the deal, covering up to 30% of capex for green vessels. PaxOcean’s orderbook swells, signaling investor appetite.

Posts on X from ABB and maritime accounts buzz with optimism, citing PXO-ACE-1 as Asia’s electrification pacesetter amid COP30 pressures.

Future-Proofing Singapore’s Port Dominance

With 40 million TEUs annually, Singapore can’t afford downtime. PXO-ACE-1’s redundant battery architecture and ABB’s digital diagnostics minimize risks. Crew training on electric systems, already underway, emphasizes safety amid high-voltage ops.

Looking ahead, hybrid hydrogen stacks could extend range for inter-port tows. ABB’s roadmap includes AI-optimized energy use, potentially adding 15% efficiency. As Olli Tuunainen stated, tugs’ profiles make them prime electrification targets, with PXO-ACE-1 proving the thesis.

Preventing and responding to bullying, harassment and sexual assault

Amendments to the Seafarers' Training, Certification and Watchkeeping Code (STCW Code) aim to prevent and respond to violence and harassment in the maritime sector, including sexual harassment, bullying and sexual assault.

The amendments are included in table A-VI/1-4 (Specification of minimum standard of competence in personal safety and social responsibilities) of the STCW Code. They outline new mandatory minimum requirements for basic training and instruction for seafarers.

These will equip seafarers with knowledge and understanding of violence and harassment, including sexual harassment, bullying and sexual assault, and information on how to prevent and respond to incidents.

Strengthening safety through improved training and certification of fishing vessel personnel

Amendments to the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Fishing Vessel Personnel, 1995 (STCW-F Convention), together with the newly established mandatory Code on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Fishing Vessel Personnel (STCW-F Code), entered into force on 1 January 2026.

These amendments follow a comprehensive review of this treaty in order to respond to the evolving needs of the fishing industry by introducing harmonized qualification standards and establishing a minimum level of competence for personnel serving on fishing vessels covered by the Convention. The revised annex to the STCW-F Convention provides the legal framework within which the mandatory technical standards set out in part A of the STCW-F Code are applied. Part B of the Code offers guidance to support the uniform implementation of the Convention's requirements, particularly for those involved in the education, training, certification, and assessment of fishing vessel personnel.

Mandatory reporting of lost containers

Amendments to the MARPOL and SOLAS Conventions on mandatory reporting of lost containers entered into force on 1 January. Containers lost overboard can be a serious hazard to navigation and safety at sea as well as to the marine environment.

MARPOL: The amendments to article V of Protocol I of the MARPOL Convention (Provisions concerning reports on incidents involving harmful substances) add a new paragraph to say that ""In case of the loss of freight container(s), the report required by article II (1) (b) shall be made in accordance with the provisions of SOLAS regulations V/31 and V/32"".

SOLAS: The amendments to SOLAS chapter V (Safety of navigation), address in particular regulation 31 (Danger messages) and require the master of every ship involved in the loss of freight container(s) to communicate the particulars of such an incident to ships in the vicinity, to the nearest coastal State, and also to the flag State which is required to report the incident to IMO. The amendments also address regulation 32 (Information required in danger messages), specifying the information to be reported, including position, number of containers lost, etc.

Safety of onboard lifting appliances and anchor handling winches

A new SOLAS regulation II-1/3-13 covers requirements for the application, design and construction, operation, inspection, testing and maintenance of onboard lifting appliances and anchor handling winches.

While awards for using zero-emission fuels will encourage compliance, the specifics are still pending.","A new report from the Getting to Zero Coalition and the Global Maritime Forum highlights the need for scalable zero-emission fuels, such as e-ammonia and e-methanol, to meet the sector’s decarbonization targets for 2040. This analysis emphasizes that developing the value chains for these fuels within the next decade is crucial for their commercial viability.

According to the report, dual-fuel ships that operate on liquefied natural gas (LNG) and ammonia are projected to be the most cost-competitive options leading up to the mid-2030s, with ammonia expected to take the lead around 2037. With recently implemented global fuel intensity (GFI) targets and penalties for non-compliance, a framework for long-term investment is emerging. This strategy could be enhanced by providing targeted rewards for early adopters and increasing penalties for those who fail to comply with the new regulations.

The International Maritime Organisation (IMO) has introduced policy measures that aim to drive the shipping industry towards zero-emission fuels, asserting that this transition will only be effective with adequate rewards and penalties. The report employs total cost of ownership (TCO) modelling and insights from over 30 stakeholder interviews, demonstrating that while various compliance pathways exist, stricter GFI regulations will increasingly favor scalable zero-emission fuels. This shift aims to phase out fossil fuel-based solutions.

The TCO analysis indicates that e-fuels have the greatest potential for achieving long-term decarbonization targets. However, immediate adoption and value chain development are essential. Jesse Fahnestock, the Global Maritime Forum’s director of decarbonisation, stated that the sector must act urgently to avoid bottlenecks in decarbonization efforts.

The report further reveals that ammonia is expected to become the most cost-effective fuel by the late 2030s. This forecast relies largely on “blue fuels,” which utilize hydrogen derived from fossil fuels with carbon capture. Even in the absence of incentives, the cost of conventional fuel is projected to climb, making LNG the lowest-cost fuel option from 2030 to 2035. With the potential for carbon capture technology to extend the utility of LNG until 2037, ammonia could emerge as the competitive choice for vessel orders already today.

However, industry stakeholders express concern over regulatory uncertainty and fuel availability, which may push them towards waiting for clearer options. Many are currently focusing on short-term solutions, such as biofuels or LNG, rather than investing in zero-emission technologies. Nevertheless, some are considering long-term investments, including dual-fuel vessels, in anticipation of how to leverage the new regulatory framework.

To successfully promote e-fuels, the IMO must offer well-defined rewards and a robust regulatory structure. The existing policy architecture outlines a tiered GFI system covering 2028-2040, creating various compliance levels for vessels. Companies can opt to switch fuels, pay penalties, or purchase surplus units from compliant vessels. While awards for using zero-emission fuels will encourage compliance, the specifics are still pending.",https://maritimefairtrade.org/wp-content/uploads/pwa/icon-192.png,N,,2026-01-09 20:56:40.529375

FAQ What is included in the global hydrogen market?","Report Assesses Hydrogen's Role and Challenges in Maritime Decarbonization

Lloyd's Register (LR) has published a report titled 'Fuel for thought: Hydrogen' assessing hydrogen's potential role in maritime decarbonization. The report, part of its Fuel for thought series, examines hydrogen from production and supply through to onboard use.

Green hydrogen can deliver zero tank-to-wake greenhouse gas emissions when used in fuel cells and is a vital building block for e-fuels like ammonia and methanol. However, the report highlights that hydrogen's low volumetric energy density, the need for cryogenic storage at -253°C, and heightened safety risks mean it is far from a ready-made solution for most ship types.

Interest in hydrogen is rising, but hydrogen-capable vessels still represent less than 0.5% of the global orderbook. Shipowners face increasing pressure to cut emissions under the EU ETS, FuelEU Maritime and the IMO's 2050 net-zero ambition. Green hydrogen stands to gain from FuelEU Maritime's two-times multiplier for renewable fuels of non-biological origin until 2033.

Infrastructure remains a critical challenge. Low-emissions hydrogen, including green and blue hydrogen, accounted for less than 1% of global production in 2025, according to IEA figures. Significant investment in production, transport and bunkering infrastructure is needed before the fuel can support wider maritime demand, and shipping will need to compete with other industries for green hydrogen.

Safety is a key theme due to hydrogen's wide flammability range, low ignition energy and potential for embrittlement, requiring rigorous design standards and specialized crew training. LR's own hydrogen requirements, set out in Appendix LR3 of its Rules for Ships Using Gases or Other Low-Flashpoint Fuels, provide a framework to manage these issues.

The analysis points to near-term opportunities for early adoption in short-sea trades like ferries, tugs and coastal vessels, where regular bunkering cycles reduce storage constraints. Fuel cell technologies show particular promise for these applications.

""Hydrogen has an important role to play in the maritime energy transition, but the pathway to scale is complex,"" said Padmini Mellacheruvu, LR's Lead Technical Specialist in Cryogenic and Compressed Fuel Systems. ""Progress will depend on early investment, careful planning and a clear focus on safety.""

Dr Maximilian Kuhn, advisor and ISO TC 197 liaison to the IMO, who wrote the report's foreword, said, ""At Hydrogen Europe, we believe that hydrogen is more than just a fuel; it is one of the main drivers of systemic change."" He added, ""Its versatility, scalability and compatibility with renewable energy sources put it in a unique position to address the complex challenges of maritime decarbonisation. Yet the path forward is not without obstacles.""

Maritime: The Next Major Biomass Competitor The maritime sector’s decarbonization requirements are beginning to exert a meaningful pull on the global renewable feedstock pool.","The center of gravity in biofuels is shifting, and an emerging pressure point is biomass. For years, road transport has dominated demand for waste- and residue-based feedstocks, absorbing most of the available supply of used cooking oil, tallow, distillers corn oil and other key inputs for renewable diesel and biodiesel production.

That era is ending.

Aviation and maritime mandates are accelerating at a time when biomass markets are tightening. The shift is creating a more competitive landscape for all participants, from refiners and traders to compliance teams and feedstock aggregators.

The question is no longer which fuel pathway grows fastest, but which sector secures the biomass first.

The New Demand Equation for Biomass

Across global markets, policy is no longer the sole driver of change. Physical biomass availability is emerging as a defining constraint. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and maritime fuels are adding new demand for the same limited pool of waste and residue oils. Both sectors will compete on price with road transport fuels to secure the feedstock needed to supply decarbonized fuels.

Several forces are tightening biomass markets simultaneously:

• Rising obligation levels in Europe for 2026 under RED III

• Stricter sustainability and traceability requirements narrowing usable supply

• Higher-value SAF pathways diverting upstream material

• Early-stage maritime adoption scaling trials into contracted volumes

As each sector claims more tonnage, the competition becomes structural rather than cyclical. Growing demand across all segments will continue to alter how these sectors operate.

SAF’s Claim on Biomass

Global efforts to displace fossil jet fuel with renewable SAF will have a significant impact on biomass economics. Refiners are increasingly testing every marginal unit of feedstock against potential SAF value, not just renewable diesel output.

What is changing:

• Current SAF production relies heavily on the same feedstocks as hydrotreated vegetable oil and renewable diesel.

• Compliance and voluntary airline demand are creating price premiums competitors cannot ignore.

• European SAF mandates are sharply increasing blending requirements.

• U.S. producers are optimizing for Section 40B and 45Z incentives, driving increased domestic SAF production.

As SAF scales, residual feedstock availability for transport renewables will tighten, requiring price adjustments to reflect these shifts.

Maritime: The Next Major Biomass Competitor

The maritime sector’s decarbonization requirements are beginning to exert a meaningful pull on the global renewable feedstock pool. The EU’s FuelEU Maritime emissions-intensity reductions, which began in 2025, require carriers to adopt low-carbon fuels well before ammonia, methanol or hydrogen reach broad commercial viability.

As a result, advanced biofuels such as used cooking oil methyl ester, fatty acid methyl ester blends and other bio-bunker fuels are entering direct competition for waste oils with road and aviation fuels.

The maritime sector may prove disruptive for several reasons:

• Large-volume consumption potential

• Immediate ability to use drop-in fuel blends

• Increased visibility of customer-driven decarbonization

While maritime demand remains relatively small today, its growth trajectory will draw biomass into a third major sector, further tightening supply.

A Feedstock Bottleneck is Forming

The most important market reality for 2026 is clear: The available biomass pool is not growing fast enough to meet policy-driven demand across all sectors.",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/cont1_biomass_shipyard_lede_0126_c249a52b97.jpg,N,,2026-01-09 07:57:42.015572

Cashew Nut Liquid (CNSL) is a byproduct of cashew processing and presents as a promising solution for renewable marine fuel.

This piece has been put together by Dr Raj Shah, Haile Mistry, Mathew Roshan and Gavin Thomas

This paper examines the benefits of the research conducted regarding the source and its compatibility with current diesel engines, as a solution in the meantime.

Solvent extraction and pyrolysis have helped reveal the benefits the liquid provides, looking from the molecular level to the comparable efficiency like diesel, while in hopes of reducing emissions.

Valorising CNSL provides an opportunity to support circular economic principles, converting agricultural waste into energy.

Although challenges remain regarding large-scale production, CNSL-derived fuels offer a sustainable, low-cost alternative, contributing to a cleaner maritime industry.

Introduction

Af ter reportedly hitting historic lows , the global maritime trade is reaching a period of fragile growth [1].

In recent forecasts, the anticipated rise is also expected to be the slowest pace in years, reaching only 0.5% in 2025, as stated in the Review of Maritime Transport 2025, published by the United Nations (UN) [1].

As climate pressures and regulations tighten, the vulnerabilities in the global economy and shipping are exposed.

The industry faces rising costs and operational challenges to comply with measures such as MARPOL Annex VI, pushing for limiting sulphur oxide (SO2) emissions [2].

The International Maritime Organization (IMO) Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index (EEXI), and Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII) regulations [3].

Additionally, facing pressures globally at the different ports, to name one, the European Union’s Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (EU MRV) framework mandates greenhouse gas reporting for ships sailing to EU ports.

With these mandates leading to increased costs and routes continuing to rise, the industry must quickly find solutions to its global impact.

Recent insights suggest that the shipping industry supplies over 80% of the world’s merchandise for export and import [1, 4].

With recent hopes to alleviate increasing global greenhouse emissions, the maritime industry realizes the trend is not going in the direction they were hoping for, facing pressures from organisations to modernise or find a lasting solution to reduce their environmental impact.

In order to limit greenhouse gas emissions in the maritime shipping industry, there has been an increase in research into compliant alternative fuels in the primary scientific literature. According to the International Maritime Organization (IMO), emissions rose from 4.7% between 2020 and 2021, increasing in the following years. This trend was reflected in the CO2 data reported by the International Maritime Organization (IMO), as seen in Figure 1 [4].

In addition, the average fleet age poses an issue, as many of the older models of these ships are prone to causing more pollution, emphasising the need for investment to reduce the carbon footprint produced by the maritime industry.

However, a solution that remains compatible with current fleet engines as a supplementary resolution could potentially mitigate some environmental concerns in the meantime.

The push to decarbonise has become a global race, intensifying the search for a scalable biofuel solution.

Meanwhile, long-term solutions remain heavily researched. Supplementary biofuels are being researched extensively by researchers to explore alternative fuels compatible with engines and fleets to reduce emissions.

In the waste streams of the nut, the waste is proving to be quite beneficial, too. Cashew nut shells (CNS) have been processed for quite some time to be converted into eco-friendly packaging and other uses.

In many countries and regions where these nuts are grown, such as South America, Central America, Africa, and Asia, these nuts are heavily produced but remain largely underutilised [5].

The shell represents 70-75% of the weight of the nut, but despite the large production and advantages, the waste isn’t widely used [6].

In India, there is often a lack of skilled manpower capable of roasting the nutshells. Due to this, the methods previously used to disregard the shells' release thick black smoke due to natural oils, which creates a public nuisance and even further pollution [6].

If not done using that method, the shells are dumped into the wild, but can then become toxic, polluting the soil [7].

Rather than contributing to more pollution, this waste stream presents an opportunity to practice the concept of valorisation, changing a once-hazardous waste into a potential practical biofuel source.

While the cashew kernel is the most valuable part, the shell has also proven to have a fair amount of value.

Cashew nutshell liquid (CNSL) is a reddish-brown viscous liquid found in the honeycomb structure of the shell [7].

Two types of CNSL have been derived through extraction, resulting in either natural or technical CNSL, each containing a different abundance of phenolic structures [8].

Natural CNSL is extracted using solvent-based methods such as hexane; the resulting phenolic structures include anarcadic acid and cardol [8].

In contrast, technical CNSL results in a high percentage of the cardanol and cardol phenolic structures.

These phenolic structures are like those found in traditional petroleum-derived fuels. While CNSL in its raw form remains unsuitable for direct use due to polymeric content, derivative blends or changes in the formulation pose as promising alternative biofuel candidates [9, 10].

In addition, CNSL fuel derivative blends exhibit characteristics like diesel.

The blends present a viable, low-cost alternative with potential to be enhanced and further improved with additional research.

In terms of changing the waste product into a fuel source, it has its own benefits too.

For example, a study by Sanjeeva et al. showed that blending tallow oil or straight vegetable oil (SVO) with CNSL as an additive could remain stable over 18 months without the need for transesterification, indicating CNSL’s potential for direct use.

Eliminating the traditional first step of transesterification provides not only economic advantages but also environmental advantages [9].

The liquid has many unique properties, not only high phenolic content but unique molecular structure, which combines aromatic phenolic rings and hydrophobic chains [10].

Differentiating CNSL from traditional biofuels, as many often lack molecular structures like petroleum-derived fuels.

The multiple reactive sites present in the chain enable blending strategies without extensive processing, as well.

Phenolic compounds often have their own benefits, providing a compound with thermal stability and antioxidant behavior, enhancing fuel storage and stability, and reducing the ability to degrade over time [11].

This is especially relevant to maritime applications, where these fuel sources are often stored in the long-term.

As a result, CNSL derivatives could provide a pathway for drop-in marine biofuels that meet the durability and stability needed from the fuels, while still providing an eco-friendlier solution [12,13].

Valorisation and physicochemical properties

In previous research conducted, the composition of these heat-treated cashew nut shells primarily consists of high-carbon biochar, often using sugarcane molasses as a binder and residual energy-rich bio-oil, ultimately producing a solid biofuel.

After solvent extraction (acetone, hexane, water), the extractives were isolated, followed by HPLC/UV analysis to determine the chemical composition and fuel properties [14].

The biochar itself contains 57.70% carbon, 6.09% hydrogen, 35.81% oxygen, with a low ash content of 2.21% and low sulphur, which is key when addressing the issues IMO mentioned regarding the current fuel sources being used [14].

In this study, adding sugarcane molasses improves the mechanical strength, cohesion, and water resistance without significantly affecting the energy content, aiding the consistency in size and density of the briquettes.

But the high energy content of 35.8 MJ/kg exemplifies just one outcome of how the CNSL can be a valuable product [7, 14].

CNSL is additionally unique for its high calorific value, low ash content, and high volatile matter, to name a few properties [7].

One downside of CNSL is its high acid levels, leading to high corrosivity, affecting engine performance and causing decay over time .

Researchers have attempted to combat these issues by creating fuel blends to remediate the risks associated with the high acidity.

One example was creating a blend of 20% CNSL biofuel, exhibiting similar characteristics to those of diesel, which helped with its compatibility with diesel engines too [9] .

In this study, conducted by Dr Sanjeeva et al. investigated improving the properties of CNSL biofuel. Investigating how to mitigate the risks that polymeric content and acidity found in CNSL cause by creating the blends.

While these blends show promise, further research is needed to fully assess engine compatibility to prevent potential problems such as clogging or reduced efficiency. Looking into the potential methods to mitigate the issues caused by raw CNSL provides a potential pathway to a green solution, since most of the engines used in Maritime fleets are diesel.

Pyrolysis

Though interest in CNSL liquid continues expanding past niche applications, attention has shifted to unlocking the full potential and composition, through thermochemical pathways using pyrolysis.

Pyrolysis is a concept that involves the thermochemical decomposition of biomass in the absence of oxygen, resulting in three primary products: bio-oil, syngas, and biochar [7,15].

The technique has proven advantageous for converting agricultural residue into energy-dense fuels, supporting the concept of valorsation.

Unlike traditional combustion practices, it has the potential to preserve energy within the feedstock, making it beneficial for fuel-based applications. This is especially beneficial for CNSL due to the oil-producing carcinogenic smoke.

For cashew nut shells, the concept is well-suited. Recent research has shown the influence of extractives on the thermal stability of biomass.

Compared to wood containing 2-5 wt. % or in tropical species up to 15 wt.%, they are significantly lower than the 58 wt. % of extractives found within cashew nut shells [7].

The most abundant extractives are ACC (anacardic acid, cardanol, and cardol) [7, 15]. Recent analysis methods conducted by Dr Sangaré et al. also allow for further individual ACC isomer analysis and their influence with pyrolysis temperatures, providing insight into both chemical composition and thermal transformation pathways (Fig. 2) [15].

These compounds contain aromatic structures and long hydrocarbon chains, characteristics aligning with those of petroleum-derived fuels compared to typical biomass-derived bio-oils. As a result, pyrolysis of cashew nut shells has the capability of yielding chemical products richer and energy-dense compared to standard wood-based pyrolysis oils [7].

In recent efforts, the transition from simple material characterisation to more complex material characterization has taken precedence.

Allowing for a deeper view of the complex composition seen in CNSL. Two types of pyrolysis have helped further this understanding, thermogravimetric and fixed-bed pyrolysis [7]. Together, they have helped researchers understand important characteristics of CNSL regarding degradation temperatures, kinetics, and product distributions, to understand the scalability of this biofuel.

Although previously used thermochemical pathways, such as gasification or hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL), pyrolysis offers advantages, the scalability was limited as they often added complexity and costs [7].

The other pyrolysis methods mentioned can provide a balanced mixture of liquid and gas, not just focusing on syngas or wet biomass.

Additionally, it creates the possibility of producing solid products suitable for direct fuel application. An advantage for maritime deployment, as it not only provides one pathway but also the possibilities of producing a bio-oil that can be directly upgraded or blended.

Like many processes, effective pyrolysis begins with proper feedstock conditioning to ensure results can properly reflect the behaviors. In one study, conducted by Dr. Sangaré et al., the cashew nut shells (CNS) were frozen at -80°C and then ground into 1-2mm particles to prevent any leaking of the extractives [7].

Extractives were removed by a triple solvent following the Soxhlet extraction process to generate the CNS fractions. As a result, the acetone extractives were rich in anacardic acids, cardols, and cardanols, accounting for roughly ~42 wt. % of CNS [7].

In contrast, hexane and water extractives were ~2 wt. % and ~18 wt. %, respectively [7]. In addition, analyses revealed the lower heating value of CNS close to 23.6 MJ/kg, volatile matter of 82.95 wt. %, and carbon content of 56.07%, showcasing the suitability of CNS as a high-energy feedstock [7].

Pyrolysis experiments were conducted using the two methods mentioned: a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) to understand the kinetics and a fixed-bed reactor to quantify the permanent gas and condensates produced [7].

For TGA samples, less than 10 mg were heated based on ambient (25 °C to 125 °C) or isothermal drying. For fixed-bed experiments, CNS particles (<1mm) were filled into a quartz tube and placed inside the reactor [7]. The tube was then heated to 400 °C at a rate of 20 °C/min. After the nitrogen addition, the gas was continuously analysed by MicroGC VARIAN CP 4900, and condensates were collected at the end [7].

Based on the results seen in the composition, CNS pyrolysis bio-oil is chemically distinctive due to its high phenolic content and aromatic structure.

These results were similar across other studies, too [15]. The ACC isomers were dominant in the acetone extractives.

This is important as it improves the thermal stability and antioxidant capacity, beneficial for maritime fuel applications. In addition, its lower heating value exceeds that of typical wood-based pyrolysis oils due to the high calorific value of CNSL [7, 15]. In other research, the low sulfur content provides a clear advantage over the IMO regulations and the goal of 2050, aiming to limit the carbon and sulfur footprint [4].

Although CNSL does prove to have challenges in its raw form, combined with the research regarding fuel blends and advances to limit its effects on the engines, it provides a potential solution for the Maritime Industry.

Future outlook and conclusion

Despite its clear potential, several challenges are still present, limiting the use of CNSL-derived biofuels. Issues regarding residual acidity, corrosivity, and long-term stability would need further development [15].

Variability in feedstock composition complicates process consistency due to different regional practices and processing methods. In addition, scaling the methods used to create many of the CNSL extractions remains a technical and economic disadvantage.

Although the research is still extensive and requires continued research and collaboration, there are many possibilities in the future to create a scalable alternative maritime fuel with CNSL.

For the maritime industry specifically, solid biofuel offers advantages to reducing greenhouse gas emissions with a high-energy alternative to marine diesel, compatible with the engines. Opting for a solid biofuel can help provide easier transport and storage, vital when being used on ships.

Moreover, the valorisation of this agricultural residue can help support the increased efforts of circular economy principles and shipping companies better adhere to the increasingly stricter regulations on fuel sustainability [14].

The circular economy concept is helpful here, as we can now utilize the entire fruit, reducing the pollution created from traditional processing, and a biofuel for the maritime industry to alleviate environmental concerns [16,17].

Maritime fuel even contributes to the increasing climate change problems. Although there is work to still be researched and methods to be refined for scalability, it provides a hopeful aspect of ways it could benefit the industry.

Not only does it provide environmental and economic benefits, but the idea of using it as a drop-in fuel has its own benefits.

The concept of drop-in fuels can be used without major modifications to an existing engine or fuel system, creating a good opportunity to reduce the carbon footprint and emissions. Unlike other biofuels generated from edible products, the benefit of being inedible also helps in reducing the amount of waste produced and does not affect the abundance or availability of the material long term.

Overall, while there are still refinements, CNSL proves to be a potential waste-derived biofuel. Its unique structures and similarities to those of traditional fuels make it a promising option for the maritime industry as the shift to a net-zero emissions future is prioritized [1,4].

More broadly, CNSL highlights the lesser-known value of agricultural residues, encouraging a shift in perspective. Bringing light to concepts, including but not limited to valorisation, circular economy, and so much more. It bridges current fuel with cleaner alternatives. CNSL provides a steppingstone toward a lower-carbon, environmentally friendly shipping industry.

The report reviews hydrogen across the full value chain, from production and supply to onboard use, identifying advantages alongside safety, infrastructure and cost constraints that limit uptake.

According to the analysis, green hydrogen can deliver zero tank-to-wake greenhouse gas emissions when used in fuel cells and serves as a building block for e-fuels such as ammonia and methanol. However, low volumetric energy density, the need for cryogenic storage at –253°C and elevated safety risks mean hydrogen is not a ready-made solution for most ship types.

The report states that hydrogen-capable vessels account for less than 0.5% of the global orderbook, despite growing interest as regulatory measures tighten. It links this trend to pressures on shipowners from EU ETS, FuelEU Maritime and the IMO’s 2050 net-zero ambition, noting that green hydrogen benefits from FuelEU Maritime’s two-times multiplier for renewable fuels of non-biological origin until 2033.

Infrastructure gaps remain a central challenge. Low-emissions hydrogen—including green hydrogen, hydrogen from biomass, and hydrogen from fossil fuels with high levels of carbon capture and permanent storage—represented less than 1% of global hydrogen production in 2025, based on IEA figures cited in the report.

The study concludes that large-scale investment in production, transport and bunkering infrastructure is required, while shipping will need to compete with other sectors for green hydrogen supplies. Safety considerations are highlighted, including hydrogen’s wide flammability range, low ignition energy and risks of embrittlement, requiring strict design standards and specialised crew training.

Lloyd’s Register’s hydrogen requirements, set out in Appendix LR3 of its Rules for Ships Using Gases or Other Low-Flashpoint Fuels, are presented as a framework to address these issues.

The report identifies near-term opportunities for early adoption in short-sea trades such as ferries, tugs and coastal vessels, where frequent bunkering can mitigate storage constraints.

This was a key conclusion of the classification society’s new Fuel for Thought: Hydrogen report.

Hydrogen can itself be used in fuel cells but is also an essential building block for the development of e-fuels such as e-ammonia, e-methanol, and e-LNG. This aspect of its development could prove to be a catalyst: the uptake of these other fuels could incentivise investment in green hydrogen production as well as research into hydrogen technologies.

There are major challenges, however, these include the fact that hydrogen boils at -253ºC, presenting significantly greater cryogenic hurdles than LNG which becomes a gas at about -162ºC. It also has a much lower volumetric density, requiring more space and costlier infrastructure.

In addition, its heightened safety risks including leak detection, lack of colour and smell, pose further challenges to its development as a marine fuel. These factors have led to a relatively low take-up so far, LR noted, with hydrogen-capable vessels still accounting for less than 0.5% of the orderbook.

Regulations are at an early stage. But interim guidelines are under development at the IMO and this should bring more understanding of the means by which fire, explosion, and other risks can be safely managed on board ships. However, the specific requirements of hydrogen and the lack of infrastructure today will make its development highly capital-intensive.

Ultimately, LR concludes, hydrogen’s adoption as a marine fuel will depend on its commercial viability which will, in turn, be dictated by the strength of the world’s commitment to decarbonisation and how carbon is priced.

FORT LEE, NJ, UNITED STATES, January 8, 2026 /EINPresswire.com/ — Carbon Neutral LLC today announced strategic collaboration discussions with EcoCreation LTD, a South Korea–based waste to Fuel technology company specializing in advanced plastic-to-oil chemical pyrolysis systems, to deploy port-based infrastructure addressing hard-to-recycle plastic waste generated by cruise ship operations across the Caribbean.

Cruise ships operate as floating cities, producing substantial volumes of solid waste that must be managed in compliance with international maritime and port-state regulations. Plastics—particularly mixed, contaminated, and low-value packaging materials—remain among the most challenging waste streams due to limited mechanical recycling options and strict prohibitions on ocean discharge. The Carbon Neutral–EcoCreation initiative is designed to support compliant waste diversion by converting eligible plastic waste into usable outputs through advanced recycling technologies, operated under applicable permits and environmental controls.

The Caribbean is the world’s most active cruise market, accounting for a significant share of global cruise itineraries and passenger traffic. High vessel density, frequent port calls, and large passenger volumes create recurring waste-management demands at regional ports, making the region well suited for port-based advanced recycling infrastructure tailored to maritime operations.

Puerto Rico has been identified as the initial deployment location due to its role as a major Caribbean cruise hub, its U.S. regulatory framework, and its established port and logistics infrastructure. The island serves as a regular port of call for major cruise operators, including Royal Caribbean International, Carnival Cruise Line, Norwegian Cruise Line, MSC Cruises, Disney Cruise Line, Celebrity Cruises, and Princess Cruises. Following initial implementation, Carbon Neutral LLC plans to expand operations to additional high-traffic Caribbean cruise ports, subject to commercial agreements, permitting, and site readiness.

The initiative aligns with international maritime waste regulations, including the International Maritime Organization’s MARPOL Annex V, which prohibits the discharge of plastics at sea and requires vessels to retain plastic waste for handling at approved port reception facilities. By focusing on port-based processing, the platform is designed to complement existing MARPOL compliance frameworks while improving end-of-life outcomes for plastics landed at port.

Over the next decade, Carbon Neutral LLC plans to deploy up to 120 pyrolysis processing facilities at strategic Caribbean ports. Subject to permitting, financing, and final agreements, these facilities are designed to process up to 300,000 metric tons of plastic waste annually. At an estimated 50% yield, this capacity could generate approximately 150,000 metric tons of pyrolysis oil per year, equivalent to roughly one million barrels annually, depending on feedstock composition and operating conditions.

At commercial scale, pyrolysis oil is intended to serve as a functional substitute or blendstock for residual marine fuels, including Bunker C. When upgraded or blended to meet applicable fuel specifications, it may help offset fossil-derived marine fuels while supporting circular-economy objectives within maritime fuel supply chains.

EcoCreation LTD has deployed multiple commercial plastic-to-oil facilities, demonstrating stable, continuous operation under real-world industrial conditions. Its chemical pyrolysis platform is among the most mature and field-proven systems capable of processing mixed plastic waste streams unsuitable for conventional recycling.

“This partnership reflects a practical, infrastructure-driven response to one of the maritime industry’s most persistent waste challenges,” said Walter Hong, CEO of Carbon Neutral LLC. “By focusing on port-based solutions and long-term investment, we aim to deploy durable infrastructure that operates at real scale, supporting compliance and improved waste-diversion outcomes for cruise operators and port communities across the Caribbean.”

Later this year, member states of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) will resume negotiations on whether to adopt an agreed plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from shipping.

China had originally supported the approval of the plan, known as the Net-zero Framework, at an IMO meeting in April 2025. However, about six months later, at talks on whether to sign off the framework formally, the country sided with the majority of member states to postpone the decision for a year.

A few other member states, including India and Argentina, made the same change of position. The situation reflects how divided states are on the IMO’s measures to control these emissions.

Still, when the negotiations resume in October 2026, the adoption of the framework would be in China’s interest. As the world’s largest ship exporter and builder, the country has already laid the groundwork for greening its shipping sector. The framework would provide its industry with the stability it needs to continue the inevitable transition.

Talks on implementation rules press on

Many thought the rules agreed in the framework to restrict ships’ emissions were not ambitious enough to meet the goals of the IMO’s climate strategy. In the meantime, however, this delay has made it even harder for the sector to meet those goals.

The strategy, adopted in 2023, aims to reduce annual greenhouse gas emissions from international shipping by at least 20% compared to the 2008 level. It also aims to replace at least 5% of fuels with alternatives that emit zero or near-zero greenhouse gases by 2030.

Without the regulatory certainty that an approved Net-zero Framework would offer, industry remains hesitant to invest in fuels that have very low to no emissions. They are currently three to four times more expensive than conventional fossil fuels.

The devil is in the details

Despite the delay, discussions over the framework’s implementation guidelines, which govern how it would operate, continue. Many are hopeful that outstanding issues could be addressed through these discussions.

However, the rules are not easy to develop.

Take, for example, guidelines on how to assess the greenhouse gas intensity of marine fuels throughout their lifecycles. The guidelines essentially determine which fuel can be used to comply with the targets. As they currently stand, they would encourage ships to initially rely on biofuels, specifically renewable diesel made from used cooking oil. That is according to a study by the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT), which has also determined that demand will outstrip supply of such fuel after 2032.

That shortage would eventually push the sector toward biofuels made from fresh vegetable oils. A rising demand for virgin oil could displace food production and lead to cropland expansion. The result would be the cutting down of forests and thus more emissions, states the study.

The guidelines haven’t yet accounted for these indirect land-use change (ILUC) emissions, which occur outside the direct supply chain of the biofuels. Adding safeguards to limit the use of biofuels that incur ILUC emissions would better support the uptake of fuels with no or close-to zero emissions, if the framework is adopted in October.

Building readiness in China

Although China voted to delay adoption, it’s still in the country’s interest to prepare its domestic industry for the inevitable transition.

Internationally, China could directly benefit from becoming a refuelling, or “bunkering”, hub for future sustainable marine fuel. Not currently one of the world’s largest such hubs, it could leapfrog some of the competition by supplying sustainable marine fuel. China is especially well-positioned to supply the likes of methanol and ammonia, which require cheap renewable electricity to synthesise.

But building out fuel production and bunkering infrastructure takes time. And it is hard to justify investment without sufficient demand signal. As such, delaying the IMO framework isn’t helping. Production of fuels and infrastructure need boosting in tandem. Otherwise, new fuel storage tanks and pipelines could end up filled with fossil fuels.

That said, leading ports in China – especially those that have already positioned themselves to become major bunkering ports – are already acting. In 2025, Shanghai’s port completed the nation’s first ship-to-ship methanol bunkering. And the port of Tianjin completed the first methanol bunkering for a car-carrier ship; while that ship was on its maiden voyage to Hong Kong, the government announced it will provide tax incentives for outbound ships using methanol as fuel.

The industry is also taking actions to support this development, with an initial focus on supplying the European market. In February 2025, the China Biomass Energy Industry Promotion Association released voluntary standards for “renewable methanol”. The standards use the term as an umbrella to differentiate gas made using biomass and electricity from gas made using fossil energy.

The standard classifies renewable methanol into three grades, based on the intensity of its greenhouse gas emissions from production to use. Grade A aligns with the European Union’s standard, which is designed to increase the bloc’s renewable energy use. The move has paved the way for renewable methanol produced in China to sell on the European market.

Potential support from net-zero fund

Payments made under the framework will be used to create a net-zero fund that rewards low-emission ships and helps developing nations to transition. China, among other nations, could qualify for such support.

The country has historically focused on building ships at low prices and in great number. Decarbonising the shipping industry will require building next-generation vessels that can run on low-carbon fuels or operate energy-saving technologies.

The ICCT has estimated that if Chinese shipyards were only to build zero-emission-capable vessels up to 2050, it would cost them an additional USD 125-444 billion, depending on fuel and propulsion type. The net-zero fund, which collects payments under the penalty-and-reward mechanism, could generate around USD 11-12 billion annually by 2030. That could potentially help to fund China’s incremental expenditure.

A successful shipbuilding transition in China would be significant for global shipping’s decarbonisation. Ships built there, whether China- or foreign-flagged, are responsible for nearly 30% of global shipping emissions, according to the ICCT.

The Chinese government has already introduced measures to encourage the switch. In 2024, it rolled out subsidies to incentivise shipowners to replace old vessels with ones powered by cleaner energy. This policy could boost the development of zero-emission-capable vessels and the adoption of energy-saving tech.

Keep calm and sail on

The Global Maritime Forum, a non-profit industry platform, held its annual summit in October – soon after the IMO meeting that resulted in the delay of the framework’s adoption.

Participants left feeling “hopeful and energised”, and highlighted the important role of the European Union and China. With Shanghai hosting the next summit in 2026, we can anticipate further significant actions from the China side.

In the end, a legally binding framework at the IMO level would ensure a level playing field for the industry’s transition. It would suit China more than unilateral efforts or a “patchwork” of regional shipping regulations.

With the regulatory certainty provided by the Net-zero Framework, China could calmly steer the industry along the decarbonisation route. While doing so, it could benefit from becoming a sustainable marine fuel bunkering hub and upgrading its domestic shipbuilding industry.

TOKYO-Mitsui O.S.K. Lines, Ltd. (MOL; President & CEO: Takeshi Hashimoto) today announced the signing of a memorandum of understanding (MOU) for a strategic partnership with ITOCHU Corporation (ITOCHU; President & COO: Keta Ishii) to advance decarbonization in the transportation sector through the use of Environmental Attribute Certificates (EACs, Note 1).

Through this MOU, both companies will collaborate in marketing, public relations, sales, and other areas to promote the adoption of EACs, helping companies using transportation services reduce their Scope 3 emissions (Note 2). By forming a cross-industry partnership between shipping and aviation, this initiative represents a new model for decarbonization in Japan (Note 3).

As part of this initiative, both companies, in their capacity as users of maritime and air transport, have engaged in mutual trading of EACs to reduce their respective Scope 3 emissions as follows:

[Transaction Summary]

MOL purchased ""air transport (air travel and freight)"" EACs issued by ITOCHU to reduce GHG emissions associated with its employee air travel (Scope 3 Category 6).

ITOCHU purchased ""maritime transport (sea freight)"" EACs issued by MOL to reduce GHG emissions associated with its use of maritime transport (Scope 3 Category 4).

This transaction was executed through the platform provided by 123Carbon (Note 4) in the Netherlands. Operating under a robust audit framework, the platform centrally manages the issuance, transfer, storage, and retirement of EACs. It ensures traceability and reliability of transactions while maintaining high transparency in accordance with global standards.

Reducing Scope 3 emissions-which represent a significant share for many companies- is an unavoidable challenge in advancing climate change response. One of key barriers is the difficulty of ensuring traceability, given the complexity of supply chains. MOL will leverage its strengths in marine transport through the use of low-carbon marine fuels, while ITOCHU will draw on its expertise in adopting sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Through this collaborative effort in the shipping and aviation sectors, the two companies will establish a framework to support transportation service users in reducing their Scope 3 emissions. Together, they are committed to advancing decarbonization across the broader transportation supply chain through this partnership.

The MOL Group has identified ""Build business models that enable net zero emissions"" as one of actions in its ""MOL Group Environmental Vision 2.2"" In February 2025, the group launched a carbon insetting & book and claim program called the ""BLUE ACTION NET-ZERO ALLIANCE"" (Note 5). Collaboration across the entire transportation supply chain is essential to achieving net-zero, and the strategic partnership with ITOCHU represents a concrete example of stakeholder co-creation under this program.

Background and History

Origins in IMO GHG Strategies

The International Maritime Organization (IMO) initiated formal efforts to address greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from international shipping with the adoption of the Initial IMO Strategy on Reduction of GHG Emissions from Ships at the 73rd session of the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC 73) in October 2018.[9] This strategy established a vision to reduce GHG emissions from international shipping and phase them out as soon as possible within the century, aligning with the Paris Agreement's temperature goals.[9] It set benchmark targets including at least a 40% reduction in carbon intensity (CO2 emissions per transport work) by 2030 and a 50% reduction in total annual GHG emissions by 2050, both relative to 2008 levels, while pursuing efforts for higher reductions.[9] The strategy outlined guiding principles, candidate short-, mid-, and long-term measures, and a follow-up program with timelines for data collection, impact assessments, and revision by 2023 to strengthen ambitions based on updated evidence.[1] Building on this foundation, the IMO adopted the revised 2023 IMO Strategy on Reduction of GHG Emissions from Ships at MEPC 80 in July 2023, which enhanced the 2018 ambitions in response to improved data from fuel consumption reporting (mandatory since 2019) and the Fourth IMO GHG Study.[1] Key updates included targets for at least 20% (striving for 30%) total annual GHG reduction by 2030, 70% (striving for 80%) by 2040 relative to 2008, and net-zero GHG emissions by or around 2050, alongside at least 40% carbon intensity reduction by 2030 and 5% (striving for 10%) uptake of zero- or near-zero GHG technologies, fuels, or energy sources by 2030.[1] The strategy emphasized a just transition, equitable impacts on developing states, and lifecycle (well-to-wake) assessment guidelines for fuels adopted via Resolution MEPC.376(80).[1] It proposed a ""basket"" of mid-term measures for finalization by 2025, including a goal-based marine fuel standard to phase down GHG intensity and an economic pricing mechanism, with comprehensive impact assessments due by MEPC 82 in autumn 2024.[1] These GHG strategies directly originated the IMO Net-Zero Framework by providing the ambition levels, timelines, and policy elements for binding implementation.[3] The 2023 strategy's call for mid-term measures culminated in initial approval of core elements at MEPC 83 from 7–11 April 2025.[3] This progression from aspirational targets in 2018 to revised goals and regulatory development in 2023 ensured a structured pathway, supported by ongoing data systems and technical cooperation initiatives like the GHG TC-Trust Fund established in 2019.[9] The framework's design reflects the strategies' focus on phasing out fossil fuels while addressing barriers through revenue mechanisms for innovation and capacity building in vulnerable states.[3]

Key Milestones Leading to the Framework

The International Maritime Organization (IMO) began addressing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from shipping through its Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC), with initial discussions on energy efficiency dating back to the 1990s, but formalized efforts accelerated post-2000 amid growing international climate concerns. A pivotal early step occurred in 2003 when MEPC adopted Resolution MEPC.134(53), establishing a voluntary GHG index for ships to encourage efficiency improvements, though it lacked binding targets. Momentum built with the 2011 adoption of the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) under MARPOL Annex VI amendments, which mandated new ships to meet fuel efficiency standards phased in from 2013 to 2025, reducing CO2 emissions per transport work by an estimated 30% for certain vessel types by 2025 relative to 2008 baselines. This was complemented in 2016 by the Data Collection System (DCS) for fuel consumption, implemented from 2019, enabling better emissions data gathering from over 90% of global shipping's CO2 output. The 2018 IMO Initial GHG Strategy marked a strategic shift, setting aspirational targets for at least 50% absolute GHG reduction by 2050 from 2008 levels, with interim benchmarks like 40% carbon intensity reduction by 2030, though critics noted its non-binding nature and reliance on unproven technologies like biofuels and hydrogen. Revisions in 2023 strengthened this via the Revised GHG Strategy, aligning with Paris Agreement goals by targeting net-zero emissions around or below 1.5°C warming, emphasizing near-term measures and phasing out unabated fossil fuels. These efforts culminated in the 2024-2025 development of the Net-Zero Framework at MEPC 81 (March 2024), where member states advanced work on core elements like fuel intensity standards and a GHG pricing mechanism, with further progress at MEPC 82 (October 2024); initial approval occurred at MEPC 83 (April 2025), but final adoption was postponed in October 2025 to 2026 amid ongoing debates, building on intersessional working group outputs from 2023-2024 that refined economic elements despite debates over revenue use and developing country exemptions.[5]

Objectives and Targets

Emission Reduction Goals

The IMO Net-Zero Framework implements regulations to meet the emission reduction targets specified in the 2023 IMO Strategy on Reduction of GHG Emissions from Ships, which sets a long-term ambition of achieving net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from international shipping by or around 2050, relative to 2008 levels, while pursuing efforts to phase out emissions in alignment with the Paris Agreement's temperature goals.[1] This vision emphasizes transitioning away from unabated fossil fuels through technological innovation and alternative energy sources.[1] Indicative checkpoints for total annual GHG emissions focus on absolute reductions: at least 20% (striving for 30%) by 2030 and at least 70% (striving for 80%) by 2040, both compared to 2008 baselines.[1] These targets account for projected growth in shipping demand and require lifecycle assessments of fuels to ensure verifiable progress toward decarbonization.[1] Complementary goals address carbon intensity and fuel uptake. The strategy mandates measures to reduce CO₂ emissions per transport work (carbon intensity) by at least 40% by 2030 relative to 2008, supported by existing technical and operational requirements entering force in 2022, with a review scheduled by 2026.[1] It also targets the share of zero- or near-zero GHG emission technologies, fuels, or energy sources in international shipping's energy mix to reach at least 5% (striving for 10%) by 2030.[1] The Net-Zero Framework's core elements, including GHG fuel intensity standards and a pricing mechanism, directly enforce these goals by imposing annual limits on lifecycle GHG emissions per unit of fuel energy (gCO₂eq/MJ), progressively tightening from the current average of 93.3 gCO₂eq/MJ toward zero- or near-zero fuels defined as ≤19.0 gCO₂eq/MJ—an 80% reduction threshold.[2] Compliance is verified through mandatory reporting, with the framework's approval in April 2025 marking a step toward binding adoption under MARPOL Annex VI.[2]

Scope and Applicability to Shipping

The IMO Net-Zero Framework applies to all oceangoing ships exceeding 5,000 gross tonnage (GT) engaged in international voyages, encompassing the majority of the global merchant fleet responsible for over 85% of shipping emissions.[2][10] These regulations, proposed as amendments to Annex VI of the MARPOL Convention, impose mandatory greenhouse gas (GHG) fuel intensity standards and pricing mechanisms on affected vessels, regardless of flag state, with enforcement by flag, port, or coastal states through inspections and compliance verification.[2][11] The framework's scope targets GHG emissions from ship fuels on a well-to-wake basis, accounting for the full lifecycle from extraction and production to combustion onboard, measured via the GHG Fuel Intensity (GFI) metric in grams of CO₂ equivalent per megajoule (gCO₂eq/MJ).[2][11] Covered GHGs include carbon dioxide (CO₂), methane (CH₄), and nitrous oxide (N₂O), with annual reporting required to an IMO GFI Registry to track deficits or surpluses against progressively tightening limits.[2] Vessels exceeding GFI thresholds must offset via surplus units from over-compliant ships, banked credits, or remedial units purchased through an IMO fund, while zero or near-zero emission fuels (GFI ≤ 19.0 gCO₂eq/MJ) qualify for rewards.[2] Exclusions encompass ships below 5,000 GT, military vessels, and those operating solely on domestic voyages, though discussions continue on potentially extending coverage to vessels between 400 GT and 5,000 GT in future revisions.[2][10] This targeted applicability prioritizes high-emission international trade routes while allowing flexibility for smaller or non-commercial operations, aligning with the 2023 IMO GHG Strategy's net-zero ambitions by or around 2050 without imposing uniform burdens across all maritime activities.[2][11]

Core Mechanisms

GHG Fuel Intensity Standards

The GHG Fuel Intensity (GFI) standards form a core component of the IMO Net-Zero Framework, mandating reductions in the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions per unit of energy from fuels and energy sources used by ships. These standards require vessels to achieve progressively stricter annual GFI limits, calculated as the weighted average emission intensity of energy consumed over a reporting period, on a well-to-wake basis that accounts for emissions from fuel production through to onboard combustion and exhaust.[12] The reference value is set at 93.3 gCO₂eq/MJ, derived from 2008 fossil fuel baselines, with targets designed to align with the 2023 IMO GHG Strategy's checkpoints, including a base trajectory of at least 65% reduction by 2040 relative to this baseline.[12][11] Applicability covers all ships of 5,000 gross tonnage and above engaged in international voyages, with the ""Company"" (typically the shipowner or operational controller under the ISM Code) responsible for compliance. Exclusions apply to vessels operating solely within national waters, non-mechanically propelled ships, and certain offshore units like FPSOs, FSUs, and drilling rigs.[12] The standards adopt a technology-neutral approach, permitting compliance via advanced fuels, wind-assisted propulsion, electrification, or carbon capture, but prioritize zero- and near-zero (ZNZ) emission sources, defined initially as those below 19.0 gCO₂eq/MJ for 2028–2034, tightening to 14.0 gCO₂eq/MJ from 2035 onward.[12] This incentivizes a shift from conventional marine fuels, which exceed 90 gCO₂eq/MJ, toward alternatives meeting sustainability criteria to avoid penalties.[11] GFI targets operate through dual trajectories: Tier 1 (Direct) deficits for ships failing the more ambitious Direct target but meeting the Base, incurring lower penalties, and Tier 2 (Base) deficits for failing the baseline Base target, with higher non-compliance costs to enforce minimum reductions. Specific reduction levels apply from 2028 to 2035, with post-2035 targets to be finalized by the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) by the end of 2032; these ensure at least 5% ZNZ energy uptake by 2030 per the 2023 strategy.[12] Compliance is assessed annually via a centralized GFI Registry, where ships incur deficits requiring purchase of Remedial Units (RUs) from the IMO Net-Zero Fund at prices starting at $380 per tCO₂e for 2028–2030 (Tier 2) or $100 (Tier 1), with future pricing subject to MEPC review.[12] Underperforming ships can offset deficits using Surplus Units (SUs) earned by overachievers (GFI below Tier 1 targets), which are transferable, bankable for up to two periods, or cancellable; ZNZ usage further yields rewards to be detailed in guidelines by March 2027.[12][11] Implementation guidelines, including lifecycle assessment methodologies, are slated for completion by March 2027, with the framework's entry into force delayed beyond the original 2028 target following postponement of adoption to 2026.[12][13] Reviews occur every five years to adjust for technological progress and equity, integrating GFI with complementary mechanisms like GHG pricing to fund transitions while enforcing verifiable reductions across the global fleet.[11] This structure aims to provide long-term certainty for investments in low-emission technologies, though actual effectiveness depends on timely adoption and enforcement amid ongoing MEPC deliberations.[12]

Pricing and Levy System

The pricing and levy system within the IMO Net-Zero Framework functions as a global economic measure to incentivize reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) fuel intensity, rather than imposing a uniform carbon tax on all emissions.[14] It requires ships exceeding specified GHG Fuel Intensity (GFI) thresholds—calculated on a well-to-wake basis—to acquire remedial units (RUs) to offset their compliance deficits, which can be obtained through contributions to the IMO Net-Zero Fund, transfers from surplus-generating ships, or banking of prior surpluses.[3] This mechanism, approved in draft at the Marine Environment Protection Committee’s 83rd session in April 2025, had formal adoption postponed from October 2025 to 2026, with entry into force delayed beyond the original 2028 target, potentially to 2029.[3][13][5] It applies to all ships of 5,000 gross tonnage or greater engaged in international voyages, covering approximately 85% of shipping CO2 emissions.[14] The system operates on a two-tier structure linked to dual GFI targets: a less stringent Base Target (e.g., 4% reduction from a 2008 baseline of 93.3 gCO2e/MJ in 2028, rising to 30% by 2035) and a more ambitious Direct Compliance Target (e.g., 17% reduction in 2028, rising to 43% by 2035).[15] Ships meeting or exceeding these targets earn surplus units (SUs), which can be banked for up to two years, transferred once to other vessels via an IMO registry, or used for voluntary cancellation, effectively creating a limited market for compliance credits.[3][14] For deficits, Tier 1 applies to ships meeting the Base Target but falling short of the Direct Compliance Target, with RUs priced at $100 per tonne of CO2 equivalent (tCO2e) during the initial 2028–2030 phase; Tier 2 covers failures to meet the Base Target, at $380/tCO2e in the same period.[14][15] These rates are subject to review at least every five years to align with technological progress and strategy goals.[15] Revenues from RU purchases, projected to generate $11–13 billion annually starting upon implementation, flow into the IMO Net-Zero Fund, which allocates funds to reward low-emission ships, support zero- or near-zero GHG fuel adoption, finance research and infrastructure, and aid just transition efforts in developing countries, including Small Island Developing States and Least Developed Countries.[3][15] The framework's hybrid feebate design—penalizing deficits while rewarding surpluses—aims to close the price gap between conventional and low-carbon fuels without broadly taxing compliant operations, though its effectiveness hinges on forthcoming guidelines for lifecycle emissions calculations and certification.[14] Enforcement involves annual reporting of well-to-wake emissions, with non-compliance addressed through the RU system rather than direct fines, promoting uptake of technologies like biofuels and hydrogen-derived fuels.[3]

Revenue Allocation and Funds

The IMO Net-Zero Fund serves as the central mechanism for managing revenues generated under the Framework's GHG pricing system, where ships exceeding mandatory GHG Fuel Intensity (GFI) thresholds must acquire and surrender remedial units corresponding to their excess emissions, thereby contributing financially to the Fund.[2] This pricing applies to ships over 5,000 gross tonnage engaged in international voyages, with tiered compliance fees designed to incentivize adherence until periodic reviews.[3] Revenues collected by the Fund are disbursed primarily to reward ships achieving low or zero emissions, such as those fully transitioning to zero- and near-zero GHG (ZNZ) fuels with a GFI of no more than 19.0 gCO₂eq/MJ, through financial incentives that offset adoption costs.[2] Additional allocations support research, development, and deployment of clean technologies; infrastructure enhancements for alternative fuels; and just transition programs tailored to developing countries' needs.[3] The Fund also directs resources toward capacity-building initiatives, including training programs, technology transfer, and technical assistance to facilitate compliance with the 2023 IMO GHG Strategy across member states.[2] A portion is earmarked to mitigate adverse socioeconomic impacts on vulnerable nations, particularly Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and Least Developed Countries (LDCs), by addressing trade disruptions or fuel access barriers from decarbonization.[3] Oversight of the Fund's operations is handled by a dedicated governing board, which manages daily disbursements and submits regular reports to the IMO's Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) for transparency and accountability, with framework-wide reviews scheduled every five years to adjust mechanisms based on progress toward net-zero targets by or around 2050.[2] Independent estimates project annual revenues of $10–15 billion once adopted and implemented following the 2026 session, potentially from 2029, though official IMO projections emphasize equitable distribution over precise forecasting.[16][13]

Implementation and Compliance

Proposed Timeline and Phases

The International Maritime Organization (IMO) approved draft regulations for the Net-Zero Framework during the 83rd session of its Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC 83), held from 7 to 11 April 2025.[3] These measures, intended to amend MARPOL Annex VI by adding a new Chapter 5, focus on reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) fuel intensity and imposing economic penalties for non-compliance, with formal adoption initially targeted for an extraordinary session (MEPC/ES.2) from 14 to 17 October 2025. However, adoption was not achieved at MEPC/ES.2 due to lack of consensus on pricing and equity issues, postponing final adoption to October 2026.[13] This delays entry into force under MARPOL procedures (16 months post-adoption), potentially to 2028 or later, applying initially to ships over 5,000 gross tonnage, which represent approximately 85% of international shipping CO2 emissions.[3] [17] Implementation guidelines for the framework's fuel intensity standards and economic measures are slated for approval at MEPC 84 in spring 2026, enabling operational preparation ahead of mandatory compliance.[3] Data collection under the global fuel standard—requiring ships to report annual GHG fuel intensity using a well-to-wake lifecycle approach—would commence from 1 January 2028, subject to the delayed timeline, with ships facing deficits required to acquire remedial units via contributions to the IMO Net-Zero Fund or transfers from surplus performers.[17] [18] The framework's stringency is designed to tighten progressively, aligning with the 2023 IMO GHG Strategy's checkpoints: at least a 20% reduction in total annual GHG emissions (striving for 30%) relative to 2008 levels by 2030, at least 70% (striving for 80–100%) by 2040, and net-zero emissions by or around 2050.[1] [19] This phased rollout incorporates a transitional structure for the economic element, where initial pricing contributions fund rewards for low- or zero-emission ships, innovation, and support for developing nations, with mechanisms to mitigate impacts on vulnerable states like small island developing states.[3] The postponement at MEPC/ES.2 risks further shifting the operational start and affecting global decarbonization momentum. The absence of explicit short-term phases in the approved drafts—unlike earlier IMO development stages (e.g., Phase I for short-term measures finalized by 2023)—emphasizes mid- to long-term enforcement, with annual adjustments to fuel intensity thresholds to drive uptake of zero- and near-zero GHG technologies.[20]

Enforcement and Verification Processes

The enforcement of the IMO Net-Zero Framework relies primarily on flag states, which bear the responsibility for ensuring that ships under their registry comply with the mandated greenhouse gas (GHG) fuel intensity (GFI) standards and related requirements, including verification of attained annual GFI, target GFI, compliance balances, and the Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan (SEEMP).[2] [21] Flag states delegate much of this verification to recognized organizations (ROs) governed by the IMO RO Code, which validate underlying data such as fuel consumption and emissions before submission to the centralized IMO GFI Registry.[21] This registry serves as a digital platform for tracking each ship's compliance status, including GFI calculations, surplus or remedial units, and transfer records, with annual reporting of GFI by ship operators mandatory once the framework enters into force.[2] Port state control (PSC) provides a secondary enforcement layer, enabling inspections of foreign vessels in national ports to confirm compliance documentation, such as Statements of Compliance issued by flag states or ROs, and to review SEEMP implementation.[21] Under regional PSC Memorandums of Understanding, non-compliant ships may face detention, particularly if deficiencies related to the NZF Statement of Compliance are deemed detainable, with the MARPOL ""no more favorable treatment"" clause extending enforcement to ships from non-party states.[21] Member states integrate these obligations into national law upon acceding to relevant IMO conventions, with periodic audits under the IMO Member State Audit Scheme—conducted approximately every seven years—assessing overall adherence, potentially including GHG reporting and verification processes.[2] Verification of fuel-related data emphasizes independent third-party processes, requiring certification of fuel emissions and sustainability attributes through schemes recognized by the IMO's Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) to ensure traceability and credibility.[2] Non-compliance with GFI thresholds triggers financial mechanisms, such as tiered fees payable to the IMO Net-Zero Fund or acquisition of remedial units, rather than direct operational bans, though precedents from regulations like the IMO Sulphur Cap suggest potential for fines, criminal prosecution, or port bans depending on national implementation.[2] [21] The framework's entry into force, following adoption targeted for October 2026 after the postponement at MEPC/ES.2 in 2025, will initiate these processes via the tacit acceptance procedure, with six months' notice binding amendments under MARPOL Annex VI.[2] [13] Industry mechanisms, including charterparty clauses, vetting programs, and insurance incentives, further support compliance by tying it to commercial viability, though ultimate enforcement remains state-driven.[21]

Technical and Operational Requirements

The IMO Net-Zero Framework imposes GHG fuel intensity (GFI) standards as the primary technical requirement for ships, mandating reductions in emissions intensity measured on a well-to-wake basis, which encompasses lifecycle GHG emissions from fuel production to onboard consumption, expressed in grams of CO₂ equivalent per megajoule (gCO₂eq/MJ).[2][12] The baseline GFI reference value is set at 93.3 gCO₂eq/MJ, derived from 2008 global shipping data, against which annual ship performance is benchmarked.[12] Ships must calculate their attained GFI as the weighted average emission intensity of energy consumed over a reporting year, accounting for GHGs including CO₂, methane (CH₄), and nitrous oxide (N₂O).[12][11] These standards apply to all ships of 5,000 gross tonnage (GT) and above engaged in international voyages, covering approximately 85% of global shipping emissions, with exclusions for vessels solely operating within national waters, non-mechanically propelled ships, and certain offshore units like platforms and drilling rigs.[2][12] Compliance responsibility lies with the ""company,"" defined under the ISM Code as the shipowner or operational controller, requiring adoption of lower-GFI fuels, energy-efficient technologies, or operational optimizations to meet tiered targets.[12] Zero- and near-zero emission (ZNZ) fuels, with GFI thresholds of no more than 19.0 gCO₂eq/MJ initially (tightening to 14.0 gCO₂eq/MJ from 2035), qualify for rewards, incentivizing transitions to advanced fuels like biofuels, e-fuels, or hydrogen-based options.[12][11] Operationally, ships must integrate GFI compliance with existing IMO measures, including the Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan (SEEMP) for ongoing improvements and the Data Collection System (DCS) for fuel consumption reporting, now expanded to verify well-to-wake emissions data.[22] Annual GFI reporting is submitted to a digital IMO GFI Registry, which tracks calculations, compliance balances, surplus units (from overachievement), and remedial units (purchased to offset deficits).[2] Fuel sustainability and emissions data undergo independent verification through MEPC-approved certification schemes, ensuring traceability and credibility before submission.[2] Non-compliance, such as exceeding tiered GFI limits, triggers mandatory purchases of remedial units at fixed prices (e.g., $100 for Tier 1 and $380 for Tier 2 deficits in 2028–2030), directing revenue to a Net-Zero Fund for decarbonization support.[12] Enforcement involves flag states for primary oversight, port states for inspections of foreign vessels, and periodic audits of member states every seven years to confirm implementation.[2] Surplus units from compliant ships can be banked for up to two years, traded to deficit vessels, or cancelled, fostering a market-based operational flexibility while mandating progressive fuel transitions.[12] These requirements necessitate technical upgrades, such as compatible propulsion systems for alternative fuels, and operational shifts toward route optimization and speed reductions to minimize energy use, all verifiable through lifecycle assessment methodologies to be finalized by MEPC guidelines prior to the framework's entry into force following 2026 adoption.[11][12][13]

Criticisms and Controversies

Economic Costs and Global Trade Impacts

The IMO Net-Zero Framework's pricing mechanism, including remedial units (RUs) for non-compliance with GHG fuel intensity standards, is projected to generate at least $11–$12 billion annually by 2030, primarily through penalties on emissions exceeding targets.[23] Tier 1 RUs, available to ships meeting base intensity targets but opting not to use zero- or near-zero GHG fuels, are priced at $100 per tonne of CO2e until 2030, while Tier 2 RUs for failing base targets cost $380 per tonne of CO2e in the same period.[24] These levies function as a de facto carbon price on shipping fuels, with potential total revenues reaching $71 billion in 2028 if extended to smaller vessels below 5,000 gross tons, though allocation remains undecided and may prioritize fuel uptake over broader transition support.[24] Compliance costs could escalate further post-2030 as prices adjust, potentially straining shipowners reliant on fossil fuels amid limited zero-emission fuel scalability. Shipping, which handles approximately 80–90% of global trade by volume, faces transport cost increases from these measures, with GHG pricing modeled to raise maritime freight rates by less than 20% under moderate scenarios.[25] [26] These hikes are likely to pass through to end consumers via higher goods prices, particularly for imports in landlocked or remote regions, though global averages suggest limited aggregate effects on trade volumes or GDP—typically under 1% reduction.[25] Regional modeling indicates variance: developed economies like the US, UK, and EU experience the lowest trade disruptions due to diversified supply chains and infrastructure, while least developed countries (LDCs) and small island developing states (SIDS) face amplified burdens from higher baseline transport costs relative to export values, port inefficiencies, and geographic isolation.[23] Such disparities risk widening global inequalities, as developing nations—often net importers—bear disproportionate shares of cost inflation without equivalent access to low-carbon fuel production or revenue recycling benefits.[23] For instance, elevated shipping expenses could undermine food security by driving up prices for traded commodities, given shipping's role in ~80% of global merchandise flows.[26] Without targeted revenue distribution to offset these, LDCs may see relative trade declines of several percentage points compared to high-income peers, potentially excluding them from green shipping transitions due to governance and financing barriers.[23] [25] Critics, including analyses from industry groups, argue this imposes a regressive ""global carbon tax"" that elevates consumer costs without guaranteed emission reductions if compliance favors cheaper biofuels over scalable e-fuels.[10]

Technological and Fuel Availability Challenges

The IMO's net-zero framework, developed to implement its 2023 Revised GHG Strategy, aims for net-zero GHG emissions from international shipping by or around 2050, relying heavily on zero- or near-zero carbon fuels and advanced technologies. However, critics highlight that viable low-carbon fuels, such as green ammonia, hydrogen, and e-methanol, remain scarce and underdeveloped for maritime scale. As of 2023, over 99% of shipping energy derives from fossil fuels, with alternative fuels comprising less than 1% of bunker sales globally. Final adoption of the framework was postponed in October 2025 to 2026, raising questions about the feasibility of its phased implementation starting from 2028. Scalability issues persist due to insufficient production capacity for green fuels. For instance, ammonia, touted as a leading zero-carbon option, requires electrolysis-based hydrogen production powered by renewables, but global green ammonia output was under 0.1 million tonnes in 2022, far below the estimated 400-600 million tonnes annually needed by 2050 to decarbonize shipping alone. Supply chain bottlenecks, including limited electrolyzer manufacturing (global capacity at ~10 GW in 2023, needing to reach 600 GW by 2050), exacerbate this gap. Technological hurdles include fuel storage and engine adaptations. Low-energy-density fuels like hydrogen demand cryogenic or compressed storage, increasing vessel design complexity and costs by 20-50% compared to conventional fuels. Retrofitting existing fleets—over 100,000 ships as of 2023—poses further challenges, with dual-fuel engines for ammonia or methanol still in prototype stages and lacking widespread certification. Safety risks, such as ammonia's toxicity, have delayed adoption, with only a handful of demonstration vessels operational by mid-2024. Biofuels offer a nearer-term bridge but face availability constraints tied to sustainable feedstock limits. While second-generation biofuels could theoretically supply 10-20% of shipping demand by 2030, competition from aviation and road transport, plus land-use pressures, cap scalability; EU biodiesel production hit 18 million tonnes in 2022, but only a fraction suits heavy marine engines without blending limits. Over-reliance on biofuels risks indirect land-use change emissions, undermining net-zero claims. Nuclear propulsion and carbon capture systems (CCS) are explored but remain marginal. Small modular reactors face regulatory bans in most ports and high upfront costs exceeding $500 million per vessel, with no commercial deployments in merchant shipping since the 1970s. Onboard CCS captures only 50-90% of CO2 but requires energy-intensive compression and port-based sequestration, unfeasible without global infrastructure buildout projected to cost trillions by 2050. These gaps underscore a potential ""valley of death"" between R&D and deployment, with IEA projections indicating 50% or more of shipping emissions unabated by 2030 under current trajectories.

Geopolitical and Equity Concerns

The IMO Net-Zero Framework's push for global GHG fuel standards and pricing has sparked geopolitical tensions, notably contributing to the postponement of its adoption in October 2025, when a slim majority of member states voted to delay finalization amid opposition from the United States.[27] U.S. resistance focused on elements perceived as overly prescriptive on fuel types and pricing mechanisms, arguing they could disadvantage American interests in fuel markets and innovation, potentially ceding leadership in clean shipping technologies to rivals like China, which dominates production of alternative fuels such as ammonia and methanol.[28] This division highlights broader fractures, as major shipping nations like China and Japan have advocated for flexibility in timelines and standards to protect domestic fleets and supply chains.[29] Geopolitical disruptions further complicate the framework's viability by exacerbating emissions and supply vulnerabilities. Events like the 2024 Red Sea crisis, driven by Houthi attacks, forced rerouting that increased fuel consumption by up to 40% on affected routes, directly countering decarbonization goals and underscoring risks to alternative fuel logistics, which rely on concentrated production hubs vulnerable to trade wars or sanctions.[30] [31] Such instabilities threaten the security of emerging low-carbon supply chains, where over 80% of green hydrogen and e-fuels may initially originate from a handful of geopolitically sensitive regions, amplifying dependencies and potential for weaponized export controls.[30] Equity concerns center on the framework's potential to disproportionately burden developing countries, whose economies depend heavily on affordable maritime trade for exports and imports. Small island developing states (SIDS) and least developed countries (LDCs), which account for significant vulnerability to both climate impacts and shipping cost hikes, have argued that uniform GHG pricing—projected to add $50–200 per tonne of fuel by 2030—could inflate import prices by 5–10%, straining food and energy security without commensurate benefits from emissions reductions occurring primarily in developed fleets.[1] [32] Although the 2023 IMO GHG Strategy mandates ""particular attention"" to these nations' needs, including technology transfer and capacity-building, critics from groups like the AOSIS bloc contend that revenue from proposed levies—estimated at $100–150 billion annually by 2040—may inadequately address transition costs, as allocation mechanisms remain contested and prone to favoring larger economies.[1] [33] These inequities risk entrenching divides, as developing nations with limited access to zero-emission infrastructure—where over 90% of current alternative fuel infrastructure is in high-income countries—face compliance penalties that could hinder growth, while wealthier states leverage subsidies and first-mover advantages in fuel production.[6] The framework's global uniformity overlooks differentiated responsibilities akin to the UNFCCC's common but differentiated convergence principle, potentially fueling non-compliance or regional fragmentation, such as unilateral EU measures that impose extraterritorial costs on non-EU flag vessels from poorer states.[32]

Reception and Future Outlook

Stakeholder Perspectives

Environmental organizations, such as Transport & Environment, have advocated for more stringent IMO measures, arguing that the net-zero framework's reliance on voluntary actions and unproven technologies like carbon capture risks delaying emissions reductions, with projections showing only a 17% cut by 2030 under current plans rather than the needed 30-50%. They criticize the framework for allowing offsets that could undermine direct decarbonization in shipping, emphasizing that biofuels and hydrogen scalability remains limited without policy mandates. Shipping industry representatives, including the International Chamber of Shipping (ICS), support the 2050 net-zero goal but highlight implementation challenges, estimating compliance costs at $1.5 trillion by mid-century and warning that absent global fuel standards, a patchwork of regulations could fragment trade. ICS data indicates that 90% of ships may require retrofits or replacement, with fuel availability—particularly green ammonia or methanol—projected to cover less than 5% of demand by 2030 without subsidies. Industry voices stress first-principles economics, noting that high-cost zero-emission fuels could raise freight rates by 30-50% initially, disproportionately burdening developing economies. Developing nations, represented in IMO discussions by groups like the African Group and Small Island Developing States, express concerns over equity, arguing the framework imposes undue burdens without adequate technology transfer or financial support from wealthier countries, potentially exacerbating global trade imbalances. They point to empirical data showing that least-developed countries rely heavily on affordable fossil-based bunkers, with projections from the World Bank indicating that fuel price hikes could add 0.5-1% to their import costs by 2040. These stakeholders demand differentiated responsibilities, citing historical emissions disparities where Annex I countries account for 70% of cumulative shipping CO2 since 1850. Classification societies and technical experts, such as those from DNV, endorse the framework's phased approach but caution on verification, recommending lifecycle assessments for fuels to avoid greenwashing, as partial credits for biofuels could inflate reported reductions by 20-30% without full supply chain scrutiny. They advocate for digital tools like blockchain for compliance tracking, projecting that without them, enforcement gaps could persist, based on audits revealing 15% discrepancies in current self-reported data.

Recent Developments and Potential Revisions

In October 2023, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) adopted a revised Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Strategy, enhancing ambitions for net-zero emissions from international shipping close to 2050, with interim targets including at least a 20% reduction in absolute GHG emissions by 2030 (striving for 30%) and carbon intensity reductions of at least 40% by 2030 compared to 2008 levels.[1] This revision built on the 2018 Initial Strategy, incorporating feedback from member states and emphasizing technological innovation, global fuel standards, and economic elements like pricing mechanisms, while acknowledging challenges in developing economies.[34] Progress toward implementing the Net-Zero Framework (NZF)—intended to operationalize the strategy through mandatory GHG fuel intensity targets starting in 2028, combined with a pricing and reward system—faced delays at the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) sessions. In October 2025, IMO member states voted to postpone adoption of the NZF by one year to 2026, citing insufficient consensus on key elements such as the hybrid carbon pricing design, which applies levies only to a portion of emissions, and reward mechanisms for low-emission fuels.[13] [5] This deferral, supported by major flag states and industry groups, aims to refine provisions for equity, including funds for capacity-building in less-developed nations, amid concerns over economic burdens on global trade routes.[35] Potential revisions under discussion include strengthening the GHG fuel intensity (GFI) targets on a well-to-wake basis to better align with lifecycle emissions, integrating life-cycle assessment (LCA) guidelines for biofuels and e-fuels, and expanding the pricing mechanism to cover more voyages for broader revenue generation toward decarbonization incentives.[12] Critics, including environmental NGOs, argue for abandoning the hybrid pricing model in favor of a uniform global carbon levy to accelerate the phase-out of fossil fuels, potentially raising up to $100 billion annually for green shipping corridors, though industry stakeholders warn of trade disruptions without exemptions for small island states.[36] Ongoing intersessional working groups are tasked with addressing these gaps ahead of resumed talks in 2026, with proposals to incorporate methane and nitrous oxide regulations more stringently, reflecting data from recent fuel availability studies showing scalability issues for zero-carbon alternatives before 2030.[37]",https://grokipedia.com/icon-512x512.png,N,,2026-01-09 17:12:08.534179
