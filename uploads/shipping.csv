Maritime: The Next Major Biomass Competitor The maritime sector’s decarbonization requirements are beginning to exert a meaningful pull on the global renewable feedstock pool.","The center of gravity in biofuels is shifting, and an emerging pressure point is biomass. For years, road transport has dominated demand for waste- and residue-based feedstocks, absorbing most of the available supply of used cooking oil, tallow, distillers corn oil and other key inputs for renewable diesel and biodiesel production.

That era is ending.

Aviation and maritime mandates are accelerating at a time when biomass markets are tightening. The shift is creating a more competitive landscape for all participants, from refiners and traders to compliance teams and feedstock aggregators.

The question is no longer which fuel pathway grows fastest, but which sector secures the biomass first.

The New Demand Equation for Biomass

Across global markets, policy is no longer the sole driver of change. Physical biomass availability is emerging as a defining constraint. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and maritime fuels are adding new demand for the same limited pool of waste and residue oils. Both sectors will compete on price with road transport fuels to secure the feedstock needed to supply decarbonized fuels.

Several forces are tightening biomass markets simultaneously:

• Rising obligation levels in Europe for 2026 under RED III

• Stricter sustainability and traceability requirements narrowing usable supply

• Higher-value SAF pathways diverting upstream material

• Early-stage maritime adoption scaling trials into contracted volumes

As each sector claims more tonnage, the competition becomes structural rather than cyclical. Growing demand across all segments will continue to alter how these sectors operate.

SAF’s Claim on Biomass

Global efforts to displace fossil jet fuel with renewable SAF will have a significant impact on biomass economics. Refiners are increasingly testing every marginal unit of feedstock against potential SAF value, not just renewable diesel output.

What is changing:

• Current SAF production relies heavily on the same feedstocks as hydrotreated vegetable oil and renewable diesel.

• Compliance and voluntary airline demand are creating price premiums competitors cannot ignore.

• European SAF mandates are sharply increasing blending requirements.

• U.S. producers are optimizing for Section 40B and 45Z incentives, driving increased domestic SAF production.

As SAF scales, residual feedstock availability for transport renewables will tighten, requiring price adjustments to reflect these shifts.

Maritime: The Next Major Biomass Competitor

The maritime sector’s decarbonization requirements are beginning to exert a meaningful pull on the global renewable feedstock pool. The EU’s FuelEU Maritime emissions-intensity reductions, which began in 2025, require carriers to adopt low-carbon fuels well before ammonia, methanol or hydrogen reach broad commercial viability.

As a result, advanced biofuels such as used cooking oil methyl ester, fatty acid methyl ester blends and other bio-bunker fuels are entering direct competition for waste oils with road and aviation fuels.

The maritime sector may prove disruptive for several reasons:

• Large-volume consumption potential

• Immediate ability to use drop-in fuel blends

• Increased visibility of customer-driven decarbonization

While maritime demand remains relatively small today, its growth trajectory will draw biomass into a third major sector, further tightening supply.

A Feedstock Bottleneck is Forming

The most important market reality for 2026 is clear: The available biomass pool is not growing fast enough to meet policy-driven demand across all sectors.",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/cont1_biomass_shipyard_lede_0126_c249a52b97.jpg,N,,2026-01-09 07:57:42.015572

This piece has been put together by Dr Raj Shah, Haile Mistry, Mathew Roshan and Gavin Thomas

This paper examines the benefits of the research conducted regarding the source and its compatibility with current diesel engines, as a solution in the meantime.

Solvent extraction and pyrolysis have helped reveal the benefits the liquid provides, looking from the molecular level to the comparable efficiency like diesel, while in hopes of reducing emissions.

Valorising CNSL provides an opportunity to support circular economic principles, converting agricultural waste into energy.

Although challenges remain regarding large-scale production, CNSL-derived fuels offer a sustainable, low-cost alternative, contributing to a cleaner maritime industry.

Introduction

Af ter reportedly hitting historic lows , the global maritime trade is reaching a period of fragile growth [1].

In recent forecasts, the anticipated rise is also expected to be the slowest pace in years, reaching only 0.5% in 2025, as stated in the Review of Maritime Transport 2025, published by the United Nations (UN) [1].

As climate pressures and regulations tighten, the vulnerabilities in the global economy and shipping are exposed.

The industry faces rising costs and operational challenges to comply with measures such as MARPOL Annex VI, pushing for limiting sulphur oxide (SO2) emissions [2].

The International Maritime Organization (IMO) Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index (EEXI), and Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII) regulations [3].

Additionally, facing pressures globally at the different ports, to name one, the European Union’s Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (EU MRV) framework mandates greenhouse gas reporting for ships sailing to EU ports.

With these mandates leading to increased costs and routes continuing to rise, the industry must quickly find solutions to its global impact.

Recent insights suggest that the shipping industry supplies over 80% of the world’s merchandise for export and import [1, 4].

With recent hopes to alleviate increasing global greenhouse emissions, the maritime industry realizes the trend is not going in the direction they were hoping for, facing pressures from organisations to modernise or find a lasting solution to reduce their environmental impact.

In order to limit greenhouse gas emissions in the maritime shipping industry, there has been an increase in research into compliant alternative fuels in the primary scientific literature. According to the International Maritime Organization (IMO), emissions rose from 4.7% between 2020 and 2021, increasing in the following years. This trend was reflected in the CO2 data reported by the International Maritime Organization (IMO), as seen in Figure 1 [4].

In addition, the average fleet age poses an issue, as many of the older models of these ships are prone to causing more pollution, emphasising the need for investment to reduce the carbon footprint produced by the maritime industry.

However, a solution that remains compatible with current fleet engines as a supplementary resolution could potentially mitigate some environmental concerns in the meantime.

The push to decarbonise has become a global race, intensifying the search for a scalable biofuel solution.

Meanwhile, long-term solutions remain heavily researched. Supplementary biofuels are being researched extensively by researchers to explore alternative fuels compatible with engines and fleets to reduce emissions.

In the waste streams of the nut, the waste is proving to be quite beneficial, too. Cashew nut shells (CNS) have been processed for quite some time to be converted into eco-friendly packaging and other uses.

In many countries and regions where these nuts are grown, such as South America, Central America, Africa, and Asia, these nuts are heavily produced but remain largely underutilised [5].

The shell represents 70-75% of the weight of the nut, but despite the large production and advantages, the waste isn’t widely used [6].

In India, there is often a lack of skilled manpower capable of roasting the nutshells. Due to this, the methods previously used to disregard the shells' release thick black smoke due to natural oils, which creates a public nuisance and even further pollution [6].

If not done using that method, the shells are dumped into the wild, but can then become toxic, polluting the soil [7].

Rather than contributing to more pollution, this waste stream presents an opportunity to practice the concept of valorisation, changing a once-hazardous waste into a potential practical biofuel source.

While the cashew kernel is the most valuable part, the shell has also proven to have a fair amount of value.

Cashew nutshell liquid (CNSL) is a reddish-brown viscous liquid found in the honeycomb structure of the shell [7].

Two types of CNSL have been derived through extraction, resulting in either natural or technical CNSL, each containing a different abundance of phenolic structures [8].

Natural CNSL is extracted using solvent-based methods such as hexane; the resulting phenolic structures include anarcadic acid and cardol [8].

In contrast, technical CNSL results in a high percentage of the cardanol and cardol phenolic structures.

These phenolic structures are like those found in traditional petroleum-derived fuels. While CNSL in its raw form remains unsuitable for direct use due to polymeric content, derivative blends or changes in the formulation pose as promising alternative biofuel candidates [9, 10].

In addition, CNSL fuel derivative blends exhibit characteristics like diesel.

The blends present a viable, low-cost alternative with potential to be enhanced and further improved with additional research.

In terms of changing the waste product into a fuel source, it has its own benefits too.

For example, a study by Sanjeeva et al. showed that blending tallow oil or straight vegetable oil (SVO) with CNSL as an additive could remain stable over 18 months without the need for transesterification, indicating CNSL’s potential for direct use.

Eliminating the traditional first step of transesterification provides not only economic advantages but also environmental advantages [9].

The liquid has many unique properties, not only high phenolic content but unique molecular structure, which combines aromatic phenolic rings and hydrophobic chains [10].

Differentiating CNSL from traditional biofuels, as many often lack molecular structures like petroleum-derived fuels.

The multiple reactive sites present in the chain enable blending strategies without extensive processing, as well.

Phenolic compounds often have their own benefits, providing a compound with thermal stability and antioxidant behavior, enhancing fuel storage and stability, and reducing the ability to degrade over time [11].

This is especially relevant to maritime applications, where these fuel sources are often stored in the long-term.

As a result, CNSL derivatives could provide a pathway for drop-in marine biofuels that meet the durability and stability needed from the fuels, while still providing an eco-friendlier solution [12,13].

Valorisation and physicochemical properties

In previous research conducted, the composition of these heat-treated cashew nut shells primarily consists of high-carbon biochar, often using sugarcane molasses as a binder and residual energy-rich bio-oil, ultimately producing a solid biofuel.

After solvent extraction (acetone, hexane, water), the extractives were isolated, followed by HPLC/UV analysis to determine the chemical composition and fuel properties [14].

The biochar itself contains 57.70% carbon, 6.09% hydrogen, 35.81% oxygen, with a low ash content of 2.21% and low sulphur, which is key when addressing the issues IMO mentioned regarding the current fuel sources being used [14].

In this study, adding sugarcane molasses improves the mechanical strength, cohesion, and water resistance without significantly affecting the energy content, aiding the consistency in size and density of the briquettes.

But the high energy content of 35.8 MJ/kg exemplifies just one outcome of how the CNSL can be a valuable product [7, 14].

CNSL is additionally unique for its high calorific value, low ash content, and high volatile matter, to name a few properties [7].

One downside of CNSL is its high acid levels, leading to high corrosivity, affecting engine performance and causing decay over time .

Researchers have attempted to combat these issues by creating fuel blends to remediate the risks associated with the high acidity.

One example was creating a blend of 20% CNSL biofuel, exhibiting similar characteristics to those of diesel, which helped with its compatibility with diesel engines too [9] .

In this study, conducted by Dr Sanjeeva et al. investigated improving the properties of CNSL biofuel. Investigating how to mitigate the risks that polymeric content and acidity found in CNSL cause by creating the blends.

While these blends show promise, further research is needed to fully assess engine compatibility to prevent potential problems such as clogging or reduced efficiency. Looking into the potential methods to mitigate the issues caused by raw CNSL provides a potential pathway to a green solution, since most of the engines used in Maritime fleets are diesel.

Pyrolysis

Though interest in CNSL liquid continues expanding past niche applications, attention has shifted to unlocking the full potential and composition, through thermochemical pathways using pyrolysis.

Pyrolysis is a concept that involves the thermochemical decomposition of biomass in the absence of oxygen, resulting in three primary products: bio-oil, syngas, and biochar [7,15].

The technique has proven advantageous for converting agricultural residue into energy-dense fuels, supporting the concept of valorsation.

Unlike traditional combustion practices, it has the potential to preserve energy within the feedstock, making it beneficial for fuel-based applications. This is especially beneficial for CNSL due to the oil-producing carcinogenic smoke.

For cashew nut shells, the concept is well-suited. Recent research has shown the influence of extractives on the thermal stability of biomass.

Compared to wood containing 2-5 wt. % or in tropical species up to 15 wt.%, they are significantly lower than the 58 wt. % of extractives found within cashew nut shells [7].

The most abundant extractives are ACC (anacardic acid, cardanol, and cardol) [7, 15]. Recent analysis methods conducted by Dr Sangaré et al. also allow for further individual ACC isomer analysis and their influence with pyrolysis temperatures, providing insight into both chemical composition and thermal transformation pathways (Fig. 2) [15].

These compounds contain aromatic structures and long hydrocarbon chains, characteristics aligning with those of petroleum-derived fuels compared to typical biomass-derived bio-oils. As a result, pyrolysis of cashew nut shells has the capability of yielding chemical products richer and energy-dense compared to standard wood-based pyrolysis oils [7].

In recent efforts, the transition from simple material characterisation to more complex material characterization has taken precedence.

Allowing for a deeper view of the complex composition seen in CNSL. Two types of pyrolysis have helped further this understanding, thermogravimetric and fixed-bed pyrolysis [7]. Together, they have helped researchers understand important characteristics of CNSL regarding degradation temperatures, kinetics, and product distributions, to understand the scalability of this biofuel.

Although previously used thermochemical pathways, such as gasification or hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL), pyrolysis offers advantages, the scalability was limited as they often added complexity and costs [7].

The other pyrolysis methods mentioned can provide a balanced mixture of liquid and gas, not just focusing on syngas or wet biomass.

Additionally, it creates the possibility of producing solid products suitable for direct fuel application. An advantage for maritime deployment, as it not only provides one pathway but also the possibilities of producing a bio-oil that can be directly upgraded or blended.

Like many processes, effective pyrolysis begins with proper feedstock conditioning to ensure results can properly reflect the behaviors. In one study, conducted by Dr. Sangaré et al., the cashew nut shells (CNS) were frozen at -80°C and then ground into 1-2mm particles to prevent any leaking of the extractives [7].

Extractives were removed by a triple solvent following the Soxhlet extraction process to generate the CNS fractions. As a result, the acetone extractives were rich in anacardic acids, cardols, and cardanols, accounting for roughly ~42 wt. % of CNS [7].

In contrast, hexane and water extractives were ~2 wt. % and ~18 wt. %, respectively [7]. In addition, analyses revealed the lower heating value of CNS close to 23.6 MJ/kg, volatile matter of 82.95 wt. %, and carbon content of 56.07%, showcasing the suitability of CNS as a high-energy feedstock [7].

Pyrolysis experiments were conducted using the two methods mentioned: a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) to understand the kinetics and a fixed-bed reactor to quantify the permanent gas and condensates produced [7].

For TGA samples, less than 10 mg were heated based on ambient (25 °C to 125 °C) or isothermal drying. For fixed-bed experiments, CNS particles (<1mm) were filled into a quartz tube and placed inside the reactor [7]. The tube was then heated to 400 °C at a rate of 20 °C/min. After the nitrogen addition, the gas was continuously analysed by MicroGC VARIAN CP 4900, and condensates were collected at the end [7].

Based on the results seen in the composition, CNS pyrolysis bio-oil is chemically distinctive due to its high phenolic content and aromatic structure.

These results were similar across other studies, too [15]. The ACC isomers were dominant in the acetone extractives.

This is important as it improves the thermal stability and antioxidant capacity, beneficial for maritime fuel applications. In addition, its lower heating value exceeds that of typical wood-based pyrolysis oils due to the high calorific value of CNSL [7, 15]. In other research, the low sulfur content provides a clear advantage over the IMO regulations and the goal of 2050, aiming to limit the carbon and sulfur footprint [4].

Although CNSL does prove to have challenges in its raw form, combined with the research regarding fuel blends and advances to limit its effects on the engines, it provides a potential solution for the Maritime Industry.

Future outlook and conclusion

Despite its clear potential, several challenges are still present, limiting the use of CNSL-derived biofuels. Issues regarding residual acidity, corrosivity, and long-term stability would need further development [15].

Variability in feedstock composition complicates process consistency due to different regional practices and processing methods. In addition, scaling the methods used to create many of the CNSL extractions remains a technical and economic disadvantage.

Although the research is still extensive and requires continued research and collaboration, there are many possibilities in the future to create a scalable alternative maritime fuel with CNSL.

For the maritime industry specifically, solid biofuel offers advantages to reducing greenhouse gas emissions with a high-energy alternative to marine diesel, compatible with the engines. Opting for a solid biofuel can help provide easier transport and storage, vital when being used on ships.

Moreover, the valorisation of this agricultural residue can help support the increased efforts of circular economy principles and shipping companies better adhere to the increasingly stricter regulations on fuel sustainability [14].

The circular economy concept is helpful here, as we can now utilize the entire fruit, reducing the pollution created from traditional processing, and a biofuel for the maritime industry to alleviate environmental concerns [16,17].

Maritime fuel even contributes to the increasing climate change problems. Although there is work to still be researched and methods to be refined for scalability, it provides a hopeful aspect of ways it could benefit the industry.

Not only does it provide environmental and economic benefits, but the idea of using it as a drop-in fuel has its own benefits.

The concept of drop-in fuels can be used without major modifications to an existing engine or fuel system, creating a good opportunity to reduce the carbon footprint and emissions. Unlike other biofuels generated from edible products, the benefit of being inedible also helps in reducing the amount of waste produced and does not affect the abundance or availability of the material long term.

Overall, while there are still refinements, CNSL proves to be a potential waste-derived biofuel. Its unique structures and similarities to those of traditional fuels make it a promising option for the maritime industry as the shift to a net-zero emissions future is prioritized [1,4].

More broadly, CNSL highlights the lesser-known value of agricultural residues, encouraging a shift in perspective. Bringing light to concepts, including but not limited to valorisation, circular economy, and so much more. It bridges current fuel with cleaner alternatives. CNSL provides a steppingstone toward a lower-carbon, environmentally friendly shipping industry.

The report reviews hydrogen across the full value chain, from production and supply to onboard use, identifying advantages alongside safety, infrastructure and cost constraints that limit uptake.

According to the analysis, green hydrogen can deliver zero tank-to-wake greenhouse gas emissions when used in fuel cells and serves as a building block for e-fuels such as ammonia and methanol. However, low volumetric energy density, the need for cryogenic storage at –253°C and elevated safety risks mean hydrogen is not a ready-made solution for most ship types.

The report states that hydrogen-capable vessels account for less than 0.5% of the global orderbook, despite growing interest as regulatory measures tighten. It links this trend to pressures on shipowners from EU ETS, FuelEU Maritime and the IMO’s 2050 net-zero ambition, noting that green hydrogen benefits from FuelEU Maritime’s two-times multiplier for renewable fuels of non-biological origin until 2033.

Infrastructure gaps remain a central challenge. Low-emissions hydrogen—including green hydrogen, hydrogen from biomass, and hydrogen from fossil fuels with high levels of carbon capture and permanent storage—represented less than 1% of global hydrogen production in 2025, based on IEA figures cited in the report.

The study concludes that large-scale investment in production, transport and bunkering infrastructure is required, while shipping will need to compete with other sectors for green hydrogen supplies. Safety considerations are highlighted, including hydrogen’s wide flammability range, low ignition energy and risks of embrittlement, requiring strict design standards and specialised crew training.

Lloyd’s Register’s hydrogen requirements, set out in Appendix LR3 of its Rules for Ships Using Gases or Other Low-Flashpoint Fuels, are presented as a framework to address these issues.

The report identifies near-term opportunities for early adoption in short-sea trades such as ferries, tugs and coastal vessels, where frequent bunkering can mitigate storage constraints.

As with other zero-emissions solutions, there are technical, commercial and regulatory challenges to be overcome, but there are no roadblocks to hydrogen’s broad adoption in the shipping industry.” This was a key conclusion of the classification society’s new Fuel for Thought: Hydrogen report.
This aspect of its development could prove to be a catalyst: the uptake of these other fuels could incentivise investment in green hydrogen production as well as research into hydrogen technologies.
In addition, its heightened safety risks including leak detection, lack of colour and smell, pose further challenges to its development as a marine fuel.","The latest report in Lloyd’s Register’s Fuel for Thought series notes the plus points for green hydrogen but also the factors that are holding back development.

This was a key conclusion of the classification society’s new Fuel for Thought: Hydrogen report.

Hydrogen can itself be used in fuel cells but is also an essential building block for the development of e-fuels such as e-ammonia, e-methanol, and e-LNG. This aspect of its development could prove to be a catalyst: the uptake of these other fuels could incentivise investment in green hydrogen production as well as research into hydrogen technologies.

There are major challenges, however, these include the fact that hydrogen boils at -253ºC, presenting significantly greater cryogenic hurdles than LNG which becomes a gas at about -162ºC. It also has a much lower volumetric density, requiring more space and costlier infrastructure.

In addition, its heightened safety risks including leak detection, lack of colour and smell, pose further challenges to its development as a marine fuel. These factors have led to a relatively low take-up so far, LR noted, with hydrogen-capable vessels still accounting for less than 0.5% of the orderbook.

Regulations are at an early stage. But interim guidelines are under development at the IMO and this should bring more understanding of the means by which fire, explosion, and other risks can be safely managed on board ships. However, the specific requirements of hydrogen and the lack of infrastructure today will make its development highly capital-intensive.

Ultimately, LR concludes, hydrogen’s adoption as a marine fuel will depend on its commercial viability which will, in turn, be dictated by the strength of the world’s commitment to decarbonisation and how carbon is priced.

Over the next decade, Carbon Neutral LLC plans to deploy up to 120 pyrolysis processing facilities at strategic Caribbean ports.
Subject to permitting, financing, and final agreements, these facilities are designed to process up to 300,000 metric tons of plastic waste annually.
“This partnership reflects a practical, infrastructure-driven response to one of the maritime industry’s most persistent waste challenges,” said Walter Hong, CEO of Carbon Neutral LLC.","Cutting-edge South Korean waste-to-fuel technology transforms cruise plastic waste into usable energy

FORT LEE, NJ, UNITED STATES, January 8, 2026 /EINPresswire.com/ — Carbon Neutral LLC today announced strategic collaboration discussions with EcoCreation LTD, a South Korea–based waste to Fuel technology company specializing in advanced plastic-to-oil chemical pyrolysis systems, to deploy port-based infrastructure addressing hard-to-recycle plastic waste generated by cruise ship operations across the Caribbean.

Cruise ships operate as floating cities, producing substantial volumes of solid waste that must be managed in compliance with international maritime and port-state regulations. Plastics—particularly mixed, contaminated, and low-value packaging materials—remain among the most challenging waste streams due to limited mechanical recycling options and strict prohibitions on ocean discharge. The Carbon Neutral–EcoCreation initiative is designed to support compliant waste diversion by converting eligible plastic waste into usable outputs through advanced recycling technologies, operated under applicable permits and environmental controls.

The Caribbean is the world’s most active cruise market, accounting for a significant share of global cruise itineraries and passenger traffic. High vessel density, frequent port calls, and large passenger volumes create recurring waste-management demands at regional ports, making the region well suited for port-based advanced recycling infrastructure tailored to maritime operations.

Puerto Rico has been identified as the initial deployment location due to its role as a major Caribbean cruise hub, its U.S. regulatory framework, and its established port and logistics infrastructure. The island serves as a regular port of call for major cruise operators, including Royal Caribbean International, Carnival Cruise Line, Norwegian Cruise Line, MSC Cruises, Disney Cruise Line, Celebrity Cruises, and Princess Cruises. Following initial implementation, Carbon Neutral LLC plans to expand operations to additional high-traffic Caribbean cruise ports, subject to commercial agreements, permitting, and site readiness.

The initiative aligns with international maritime waste regulations, including the International Maritime Organization’s MARPOL Annex V, which prohibits the discharge of plastics at sea and requires vessels to retain plastic waste for handling at approved port reception facilities. By focusing on port-based processing, the platform is designed to complement existing MARPOL compliance frameworks while improving end-of-life outcomes for plastics landed at port.

Over the next decade, Carbon Neutral LLC plans to deploy up to 120 pyrolysis processing facilities at strategic Caribbean ports. Subject to permitting, financing, and final agreements, these facilities are designed to process up to 300,000 metric tons of plastic waste annually. At an estimated 50% yield, this capacity could generate approximately 150,000 metric tons of pyrolysis oil per year, equivalent to roughly one million barrels annually, depending on feedstock composition and operating conditions.

At commercial scale, pyrolysis oil is intended to serve as a functional substitute or blendstock for residual marine fuels, including Bunker C. When upgraded or blended to meet applicable fuel specifications, it may help offset fossil-derived marine fuels while supporting circular-economy objectives within maritime fuel supply chains.

EcoCreation LTD has deployed multiple commercial plastic-to-oil facilities, demonstrating stable, continuous operation under real-world industrial conditions. Its chemical pyrolysis platform is among the most mature and field-proven systems capable of processing mixed plastic waste streams unsuitable for conventional recycling.

Later this year, member states of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) will resume negotiations on whether to adopt an agreed plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from shipping.

China had originally supported the approval of the plan, known as the Net-zero Framework, at an IMO meeting in April 2025. However, about six months later, at talks on whether to sign off the framework formally, the country sided with the majority of member states to postpone the decision for a year.

A few other member states, including India and Argentina, made the same change of position. The situation reflects how divided states are on the IMO’s measures to control these emissions.

Still, when the negotiations resume in October 2026, the adoption of the framework would be in China’s interest. As the world’s largest ship exporter and builder, the country has already laid the groundwork for greening its shipping sector. The framework would provide its industry with the stability it needs to continue the inevitable transition.

Talks on implementation rules press on

Many thought the rules agreed in the framework to restrict ships’ emissions were not ambitious enough to meet the goals of the IMO’s climate strategy. In the meantime, however, this delay has made it even harder for the sector to meet those goals.

The strategy, adopted in 2023, aims to reduce annual greenhouse gas emissions from international shipping by at least 20% compared to the 2008 level. It also aims to replace at least 5% of fuels with alternatives that emit zero or near-zero greenhouse gases by 2030.

Without the regulatory certainty that an approved Net-zero Framework would offer, industry remains hesitant to invest in fuels that have very low to no emissions. They are currently three to four times more expensive than conventional fossil fuels.

The devil is in the details

Despite the delay, discussions over the framework’s implementation guidelines, which govern how it would operate, continue. Many are hopeful that outstanding issues could be addressed through these discussions.

However, the rules are not easy to develop.

Take, for example, guidelines on how to assess the greenhouse gas intensity of marine fuels throughout their lifecycles. The guidelines essentially determine which fuel can be used to comply with the targets. As they currently stand, they would encourage ships to initially rely on biofuels, specifically renewable diesel made from used cooking oil. That is according to a study by the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT), which has also determined that demand will outstrip supply of such fuel after 2032.

That shortage would eventually push the sector toward biofuels made from fresh vegetable oils. A rising demand for virgin oil could displace food production and lead to cropland expansion. The result would be the cutting down of forests and thus more emissions, states the study.

The guidelines haven’t yet accounted for these indirect land-use change (ILUC) emissions, which occur outside the direct supply chain of the biofuels. Adding safeguards to limit the use of biofuels that incur ILUC emissions would better support the uptake of fuels with no or close-to zero emissions, if the framework is adopted in October.

Building readiness in China

Although China voted to delay adoption, it’s still in the country’s interest to prepare its domestic industry for the inevitable transition.

Internationally, China could directly benefit from becoming a refuelling, or “bunkering”, hub for future sustainable marine fuel. Not currently one of the world’s largest such hubs, it could leapfrog some of the competition by supplying sustainable marine fuel. China is especially well-positioned to supply the likes of methanol and ammonia, which require cheap renewable electricity to synthesise.

But building out fuel production and bunkering infrastructure takes time. And it is hard to justify investment without sufficient demand signal. As such, delaying the IMO framework isn’t helping. Production of fuels and infrastructure need boosting in tandem. Otherwise, new fuel storage tanks and pipelines could end up filled with fossil fuels.

That said, leading ports in China – especially those that have already positioned themselves to become major bunkering ports – are already acting. In 2025, Shanghai’s port completed the nation’s first ship-to-ship methanol bunkering. And the port of Tianjin completed the first methanol bunkering for a car-carrier ship; while that ship was on its maiden voyage to Hong Kong, the government announced it will provide tax incentives for outbound ships using methanol as fuel.

The industry is also taking actions to support this development, with an initial focus on supplying the European market. In February 2025, the China Biomass Energy Industry Promotion Association released voluntary standards for “renewable methanol”. The standards use the term as an umbrella to differentiate gas made using biomass and electricity from gas made using fossil energy.

The standard classifies renewable methanol into three grades, based on the intensity of its greenhouse gas emissions from production to use. Grade A aligns with the European Union’s standard, which is designed to increase the bloc’s renewable energy use. The move has paved the way for renewable methanol produced in China to sell on the European market.

Potential support from net-zero fund

Payments made under the framework will be used to create a net-zero fund that rewards low-emission ships and helps developing nations to transition. China, among other nations, could qualify for such support.

The country has historically focused on building ships at low prices and in great number. Decarbonising the shipping industry will require building next-generation vessels that can run on low-carbon fuels or operate energy-saving technologies.

The ICCT has estimated that if Chinese shipyards were only to build zero-emission-capable vessels up to 2050, it would cost them an additional USD 125-444 billion, depending on fuel and propulsion type. The net-zero fund, which collects payments under the penalty-and-reward mechanism, could generate around USD 11-12 billion annually by 2030. That could potentially help to fund China’s incremental expenditure.

A successful shipbuilding transition in China would be significant for global shipping’s decarbonisation. Ships built there, whether China- or foreign-flagged, are responsible for nearly 30% of global shipping emissions, according to the ICCT.

The Chinese government has already introduced measures to encourage the switch. In 2024, it rolled out subsidies to incentivise shipowners to replace old vessels with ones powered by cleaner energy. This policy could boost the development of zero-emission-capable vessels and the adoption of energy-saving tech.

Keep calm and sail on

The Global Maritime Forum, a non-profit industry platform, held its annual summit in October – soon after the IMO meeting that resulted in the delay of the framework’s adoption.

Participants left feeling “hopeful and energised”, and highlighted the important role of the European Union and China. With Shanghai hosting the next summit in 2026, we can anticipate further significant actions from the China side.

In the end, a legally binding framework at the IMO level would ensure a level playing field for the industry’s transition. It would suit China more than unilateral efforts or a “patchwork” of regional shipping regulations.

With the regulatory certainty provided by the Net-zero Framework, China could calmly steer the industry along the decarbonisation route. While doing so, it could benefit from becoming a sustainable marine fuel bunkering hub and upgrading its domestic shipbuilding industry.

Japan’s ITOCHU Corp said it has signed a strategic partnership memorandum with shipping company Mitsui O.S.K. Lines (MOL) to promote the use of environmental attribute certificates as a tool to cut carbon emissions in the transportation sector, Trend reports via ITOCU.

Under the agreement, the two companies will jointly work on marketing, public relations and sales initiatives aimed at encouraging companies that use transport services to reduce their Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions, ITOCHU said in a statement.

The partnership brings together the aviation and maritime sectors, creating what the companies described as a new cross-industry model for decarbonisation in Japan, at a time when cutting Scope 3 emissions – those generated across supply chains – has become an increasingly urgent challenge for companies globally.

ITOCHU has been promoting the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), while MOL has focused on expanding low-carbon marine fuels. By combining their efforts, the companies aim to establish a framework that helps logistics users lower emissions across the entire transportation supply chain.

As part of the initiative, the two companies carried out a reciprocal transaction of environmental attribute certificates. ITOCHU purchased certificates generated by MOL to offset emissions linked to marine transport services, while MOL bought aviation-related certificates generated by ITOCHU to reduce emissions from employee air travel.

The transaction was conducted via a platform operated by 123Carbon, a Netherlands-based environmental technology company, which manages the issuance, transfer and retirement of certificates under an audited system designed to ensure traceability and transparency in line with global standards.

TOKYO-Mitsui O.S.K. Lines, Ltd. (MOL; President & CEO: Takeshi Hashimoto) today announced the signing of a memorandum of understanding (MOU) for a strategic partnership with ITOCHU Corporation (ITOCHU; President & COO: Keta Ishii) to advance decarbonization in the transportation sector through the use of Environmental Attribute Certificates (EACs, Note 1).

Through this MOU, both companies will collaborate in marketing, public relations, sales, and other areas to promote the adoption of EACs, helping companies using transportation services reduce their Scope 3 emissions (Note 2). By forming a cross-industry partnership between shipping and aviation, this initiative represents a new model for decarbonization in Japan (Note 3).

As part of this initiative, both companies, in their capacity as users of maritime and air transport, have engaged in mutual trading of EACs to reduce their respective Scope 3 emissions as follows:

[Transaction Summary]

MOL purchased ""air transport (air travel and freight)"" EACs issued by ITOCHU to reduce GHG emissions associated with its employee air travel (Scope 3 Category 6).

ITOCHU purchased ""maritime transport (sea freight)"" EACs issued by MOL to reduce GHG emissions associated with its use of maritime transport (Scope 3 Category 4).

This transaction was executed through the platform provided by 123Carbon (Note 4) in the Netherlands. Operating under a robust audit framework, the platform centrally manages the issuance, transfer, storage, and retirement of EACs. It ensures traceability and reliability of transactions while maintaining high transparency in accordance with global standards.

Reducing Scope 3 emissions-which represent a significant share for many companies- is an unavoidable challenge in advancing climate change response. One of key barriers is the difficulty of ensuring traceability, given the complexity of supply chains. MOL will leverage its strengths in marine transport through the use of low-carbon marine fuels, while ITOCHU will draw on its expertise in adopting sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Through this collaborative effort in the shipping and aviation sectors, the two companies will establish a framework to support transportation service users in reducing their Scope 3 emissions. Together, they are committed to advancing decarbonization across the broader transportation supply chain through this partnership.

The MOL Group has identified ""Build business models that enable net zero emissions"" as one of actions in its ""MOL Group Environmental Vision 2.2"" In February 2025, the group launched a carbon insetting & book and claim program called the ""BLUE ACTION NET-ZERO ALLIANCE"" (Note 5). Collaboration across the entire transportation supply chain is essential to achieving net-zero, and the strategic partnership with ITOCHU represents a concrete example of stakeholder co-creation under this program.

Fuel for thought: Hydrogen examines hydrogen from production and supply through to onboard use, highlighting the fuel’s advantages alongside the safety, infrastructure and cost challenges that currently restrict its adoption.

Green hydrogen has the potential to deliver zero tank-to-wake greenhouse gas emissions when used in fuel cells and has a vital role as the building block for e-fuels such as ammonia and methanol. But hydrogen’s low volumetric energy density, the need for cryogenic storage at –253°C and heightened safety risks means that the fuel is far from a ready-made solution for most ship types.

The report notes that while interest is rising, particularly as regulatory measures tighten, hydrogen-capable vessels still represent less than 0.5% of the global orderbook.

The assessment comes as shipowners face increasing pressure to cut emissions under the EU ETS, FuelEU Maritime and the IMO’s 2050 net-zero ambition. Green hydrogen stands to gain from FuelEU Maritime’s two-times multiplier for renewable fuels of non-biological origin until 2033, a mechanism that could accelerate its uptake as production scales.

Infrastructure—and the lack of it—remain a critical challenge. Despite a few emerging bunkering projects, low-emissions hydrogen as a whole – including hydrogen produced via renewable-energy powered electrolysis (green hydrogen), biomass and fossil fuels with high levels of carbon capture and permanent storage (blue hydrogen) – accounted for less than 1% of global production in 2025, according to IEA figures 1.

Significant investment in production, transport and bunkering infrastructure is needed before the fuel can support wider maritime demand. Shipping will also need to compete with other industries for green hydrogen, driving the need for robust certification schemes and transparent lifecycle assessments.

Safety emerges as a key theme. Hydrogen’s wide flammability range, low ignition energy and potential for embrittlement require rigorous design standards and specialised crew training.

LR’s own hydrogen requirements, set out in Appendix LR3 of its Rules for Ships Using Gases or Other Low-Flashpoint Fuels, provide a framework to manage those issues, supported by guidance on fuel cells, composite cylinders, liquid hydrogen systems and bunkering arrangements.

Despite these hurdles, the analysis points to near-term opportunities. Early adoption is most viable for short-sea trades such as ferries, tugs and coastal vessels where regular bunkering cycles reduce the constraints of onboard storage.

Fuel cell technologies show particular promise for these applications, supported by improving cost trajectories and advances in durability. Hydrogen-ready designs and hybrid fuel strategies also offer shipowners a practical route to futureproof assets.

Padmini Mellacheruvu, LR's Lead Technical Specialist in Cryogenic and Compressed Fuel Systems, said: “Hydrogen has an important role to play in the maritime energy transition, but the pathway to scale is complex. Progress will depend on early investment, careful planning and a clear focus on safety.

“Our latest Fuel for Thought report brings clarity to both the potential of hydrogen and the substantial work still required to enable its safe, scalable and commercially viable use.”

The report was written with a foreword by Dr Maximilian Kuhn, advisor and ISO TC 197 liaison to the IMO, as well as advisor to Hydrogen Europe. He said: “At Hydrogen Europe, we believe that hydrogen is more than just a fuel; it is one of the main drivers of systemic change.

“Its versatility, scalability and compatibility with renewable energy sources put it in a unique position to address the complex challenges of maritime decarbonisation. Yet the path forward is not without obstacles: Infrastructure, regulation, safety and cost remain critical hurdles.

“This report does not shy away from these realities. Instead, it provides a clear-eyed assessment of the current landscape while charting a course for innovation, investment and international collaboration.”

In its Fuel for Thought: Hydrogen report, LR highlights hydrogen's low energy density by volume as a key constraint for ship design and operations.

Even in liquefied form, hydrogen contains far less energy density on a volumetric basis than other marine fuels.

The report notes that liquid hydrogen delivers around 8.49 megajoules (MJ) per liter, compared with about 21.6 MJ per liter for LNG, meaning vessels require substantially larger fuel tanks to achieve comparable range.

This tank space penalty can reduce cargo capacity or necessitate more frequent bunkering, limiting hydrogen's practicality for long-distance voyages.

As a result, LR says most current hydrogen projects are focused on short-sea and coastal vessels with predictable routes and regular refuelling opportunities.

For instance, Samskip's two hydrogen fuel cell powered ships are set to be operational next year.

Infrastructure presents a parallel challenge.

LR notes that hydrogen bunkering facilities are still limited and will require significant capital investment due to the need for specialized storage, handling and transportation systems.

The report also points out that low-emissions hydrogen accounted for less than 1% of global hydrogen production in 2023, raising concerns over near-term fuel availability for shipping.

While early projects, often supported by state funding, are helping to build operational experience, LR concludes that stronger carbon pricing and broader decarbonisation policies will be critical to improving hydrogen's commercial viability and enabling wider adoption in the shipping sector.

Based on its experience from its ammonia and hydrogen engine R&D projects, the Japanese engine manufacturer plans to complete its methanol dual-fuel engine by 2027.

A low-carbon fuel, methanol can significantly reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, along with sulphur oxides, nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulate matter. Unlike gaseous fuels, methanol remains liquid at ambient temperatures and atmospheric pressure, simplifying storage and handling. Its versatility makes it suitable for a wide range of vessels, particularly medium- and small-sized ships. Looking ahead, the adoption of green methanol – produced from biomass and renewable energy – could further enhance its role in lowering GHG emissions from maritime transport.

Ammonia engine

This initiative by the Japanese engine maker follows completion of its first ammonia-capable marine engine, the 7UEC50LSJA, in August 2025, and ongoing work on a hydrogen-fuelled model, 6UEC35LSGH. J-ENG’s first full-scale commercial high-pressure ammonia dual-fuel engine will be installed in a new medium-sized gas carrier under construction at JMU Ariake Shipyard that will enter service this year.

ClassNK certified performance verification tests in both ammonia and heavy fuel oil (HFO) operation that were conducted on the dual-fuel engine, as well as post-operation inspections of its major components.

Engine performance

While ammonia is carbon free, it is also highly toxic and corrosive, requiring advanced safety measures, careful handling, and precise combustion. Nitrous oxide (N20) – so-called ‘laughing gas’ – is a powerful GHG produced in the combustion of ammonia, with a global warming potential of 273.

Trial data showed that at 100% load and a 95% ammonia co-firing rate (5% pilot fuel), the engine produced N2O emissions of approximately 3 ppm, while achieving a reduction of over 90% in GHG emissions compared with heavy fuel oil (HFO) operation. NOx emissions were about half those of HFO engines, with unburned ammonia emissions – ammonia slip – virtually zero with the use of selective catalytic reduction. J-ENG confirmed that the thermal efficiency in ammonia fuel operation mode is equivalent to or higher than operating on HFO.

New model, new factory

Besides a 50-bore two-stroke ammonia dual-fuel model, the engine maker is developing a 60-bore version for a wider range of ship types.

Backed by funding from Japan’s Ministry of the Environment and the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, J-ENG plans to expand the production of ammonia dual-fuel engines by constructing a new factory, set to open in 2028.",https://dvzpv6x5302g1.cloudfront.net/AcuCustom/Sitename/DAM/185/UEC50LSJA_1200x675-21_Main.png,N,,2026-01-08 11:12:35.230553

Conclusion Green shipping corridors represent the future of maritime trade.","A. Introduction

The global shipping industry stands at a critical crossroads. Shipping, as important as it is to international trade, remains one of the contributors to global emissions, and without decisive action, the rate at which our environment is negatively affected by emissions from ships and shipping activities would continue to increase drastically. In response, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) adopted a revised greenhouse gas strategy in July 2023, setting ambitious targets towards the reduction of these emissions.

For Nigeria, Africa’s largest economy and most populous nation, green shipping corridors cannot be overemphasised. As the country handles the majority of West Africa’s maritime trade through its ports, particularly Apapa and Tin Can Island in Lagos, Nigeria’s participation in the global maritime decarbonization movement is essential not only for environmental compliance but for maintaining competitiveness in international trade.

The Global Green Shipping Corridor Movement

In November 2021, at the Conference of the Parties in Glasgow, 21 countries signed the Clydebank Declaration, signalling their intent to promote the development of green shipping corridors. The declaration set a target of establishing at least six green corridors on major deep-sea routes by 2026. Since then, the movement has gained remarkable momentum. The 2025 edition of the Annual Progress Report on Green Shipping Corridors reported positive traction in this regard . Green corridors are now seen as more than just environmental projects; they are market tools that facilitate compliant trade, unlock green financing, and give advantages to ports and routes that can provide verified low-emission operations.

Nigeria’s Maritime Decarbonization Journey

Nigeria has demonstrated a progressive commitment to maritime decarbonization. At COP28 in Dubai, Nigeria announced the establishment of an emissions inventory to define its national maritime emissions baseline. This foundational step represents critical groundwork for any meaningful decarbonization strategy, as effective emissions reduction requires accurate measurement and reliable data, which is increasingly necessary for regulatory compliance and eligibility for investment.

Building on this commitment, NIMASA collaborated with University College London researchers to develop Nigeria’s first verifiable maritime emissions inventory, presented at COP29 . Most recently, at COP30 in Brazil, NIMASA showcased a pioneering Public-Private Partnership model for African maritime decarbonization with the establishment of the Nigerian Maritime Continuous Emissions Monitoring System .

The Nigerian Maritime Continuous Emissions Monitoring System represents Africa’s first comprehensive framework for tracking vessel emissions in real-time. As digital emissions tracking becomes increasingly determinant of port competitiveness, vessel compliance, and eligibility for green shipping investments, Nigeria’s early adoption strengthens its position as a leading maritime hub in West and Central Africa .

Infrastructure Foundations: Port Modernization and Green Initiatives

Successful green shipping corridors require modern port infrastructure capable of supporting alternative fuels and zero-emission vessels. Nigeria has continued to launch ambitious port modernization programs that align with sustainability objectives.

The modernization efforts encompass quay strengthening, dredging, yard expansion, and integration of green port principles aligned with the International Association of Ports and Harbors World Ports Sustainability Programme. The Nigerian Ports Authority plans to embed Environmental, Social, and Governance principles into operations, promoting clean energy transitions, emissions control, and coastal restoration.

Private sector actors are also contributing significantly. APM Terminals invested $115 million in upgrading the West Africa Container Terminal at Onne Port, and importantly, signed a Solar Lease Agreement with Starsight Energy to provide an expected 1.2 gigawatt hours of solar electricity annually over 15 years.

Such initiatives show that green port infrastructure in Nigeria is not only feasible but also financially viable, creating models that can be replicated for future corridor-linked investments.

Market and Commercial Opportunities in Nigeria’s Green Maritime Transition

Green shipping corridors are not just a single infrastructure project; they form a coordinated investment ecosystem. For investors, opportunities are practical, scalable, and already appearing in Nigeria. These includes:

1. Shore Power and Terminal Electrification Projects

One of the most immediate and commercially viable entry points is shore power and terminal electrification. Providing grid-based or renewable electricity to vessels at berth, while electrifying quay cranes, yard tractors, and terminal equipment, leads to rapid emissions reductions and measurable savings. In Nigeria, these projects can be structured through concession addenda, Engineering, procurement, and construction contracts, or availability-payment Public Private Partnership (PPPs) backed by long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs).

2. Renewable Energy Generation for Ports (Solar and Storage)

Closely linked to electrification is the chance to invest in renewable energy generation for ports. Solar farms with battery storage can replace diesel generation, stabilize energy costs for terminals, and ensure shore power reliability. These assets attract investors because they have revenue backed by long-term PPAs or lease agreements with port authorities and terminal operators.

3. Green Bunkering, Storage, and Fuel Logistics

Another important commercial opportunity lies in green bunkering and fuel logistics. As shipping lines shift to low-carbon fuels, storage terminals, bunkering berths, and supporting logistics infrastructure will become strategic points. Investors can develop fuel storage tanks, small-scale bunkering berths, and inland distribution systems serving biofuels, blended fuels, and later e-fuels.

These projects typically occur as joint ventures between international fuel suppliers and Nigerian downstream operators. They include long-term storage leases from port authorities and off-take agreements from shipping companies.

4. Emissions Monitoring, Verification, and Digital Services

Green shipping corridors rely on verified emissions reductions, creating a strong business case for digital monitoring and verification services. Platforms that gather emissions data from vessels and ports, provide certified reporting, and ensure compliance can earn recurring revenues through service contracts and subscriptions. These businesses are capital-light, high-margin, and can grow quickly as participation in corridors expands.

5. Port Modernisation and Automation with Green Add-Ons

Port modernisation remains a key opportunity, especially when combined with green upgrades. Investing in quay deepening, automated gates, terminal operating systems, and yard expansion increases throughput and revenue per (Twenty-foot Equivalent Unit) TEU while enabling electrification and alternative fuel logistics.

These projects usually go through concession renegotiations or PPPs, with green investment requirements included in performance KPIs. An attractive structure is a concession extension or tariff adjustment linked to mandatory shore power readiness or electrification targets. This allows investors to capture both operational gains and green finance incentives.

6. Financing, Blended Capital, and Green Financial Products

Finally, financing is a significant investment opportunity. Green shipping corridors depend on blended finance structures that combine commercial capital with concessional Development Finance Institution (DFI) funding, guarantees, and carbon or grant revenues. Investors that act as anchor equity providers can gain value not only from asset operations but also from syndication, refinancing, and green bond issuance once projects stabilize.

Policy Recommendations

To position Nigeria effectively within the global green shipping corridor movement, several policy interventions are necessary:

a. Developing a National Green Shipping Strategy: Nigeria requires a comprehensive strategy that sets clear targets, timelines, and implementation frameworks for maritime decarbonization.

b. Establish Public-Private Partnership Frameworks: The scale of investment required exceeds public sector capacity alone. Nigeria must create attractive PPP frameworks that clearly define risk allocation, provide adequate guarantees, and ensure fair returns on green shipping investments.

c. Invest in Alternative Fuel Infrastructure: Priority should be given to developing bunkering infrastructure for the most promising alternative fuels.

d. Enhance Port Efficiency: Green corridor development cannot succeed with inefficient port operations. Continued focus on reducing cargo dwell times, streamlining clearance procedures, and improving access infrastructure remains essential.

e. Build Technical Capacity: Substantial investment in maritime education and training programs is required to develop the skilled workforce necessary for operating zero-emission vessels and infrastructure.

f. Engage Regional Partners: Nigeria should take leadership in establishing West African green corridor initiatives, working with neighboring countries to develop coordinated regional approaches that maximize collective impact.

Conclusion

Green shipping corridors represent the future of maritime trade. As the global industry transitions toward zero emissions, Nigeria faces a strategic choice: lead the transition within the African context or risk marginalization as competitors adopt greener practices.

Nigeria has the geography, traffic flow, and growing institutional awareness to lead West Africa’s early green corridor efforts. However, intent must be followed by action. The country needs a reliable emissions baseline, pilot electrification and shore power projects, clear permitting paths for green fuels, and structured partnerships that combine main traffic, technical skills, and blended financing. If Nigeria utilizes existing momentum, such as NIMASA’s emissions monitoring work and private interest in port upgrades, it can translate corridors into industrial opportunities.

Ammonia is central to Korea’s green shipping roadmap, but its chemical reactivity undermines conventional marine materials, often triggering oxide breakdown and surface failure. Standard coatings, including nitrides and wet plating, leave behind pores and interface defects that become entry points for corrosion. The new coating, labeled ta-C:Hx, avoids those weaknesses through a redesigned process that stabilizes the surface at both ambient and cryogenic temperatures. The result is a dense carbon layer that resists degradation in direct contact with ammonia fuel.

In his New Year’s message, Dominguez placed the emphasis firmly on delivery, arguing that the focus must now shift from commitments to results.

“From policy to action, it is about enhancing maritime excellence,” he said, describing 2026 as “the year of implementation” and one aimed at “moving from plans to concrete actions and measurable progress”, in line with the organisation’s world maritime theme of “from policy to practice, powering maritime excellence”.

At the centre of that effort, he said, are the nearly two million seafarers working at sea worldwide.

Recognising that training needs to keep pace with rapid change, Dominguez said the IMO will begin “a major update of the STCW convention”, stressing that education and certification frameworks must reflect “the new realities of the industry”.

The planned revision of the convention on standards of training, certification and watchkeeping will, he explained, cover emerging technologies, new fuels and changing operational requirements, particularly as the sector accelerates its decarbonisation efforts.

On climate action, Dominguez reiterated that the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions remains a central priority, noting that the organisation is “moving ahead with efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions from the sector by or around 2050”.

Further developments, he added, are expected in the period ahead.

At the same time, technological innovation is moving higher up the agenda. Dominguez said that “all eyes will be on the finalization of the autonomous ships code”, pointing to the growing role of automation and digitalisation in shaping the future of maritime operations.

Beyond shipping itself, he also referred to the IMO’s broader environmental commitments, confirming continued support for the High Seas Convention as it enters into force this month.

The treaty, he said, underlines “our global commitment to protect the ocean and biodiversity”.

The report offers insights into hydrogen’s potential to transform shipping, offering a clear-eyed assessment of the opportunities, challenges, and pathways for adoption. It also provides an assessment of hydrogen propulsion technologies, including internal combustion engines and fuel cells, and evaluates their maturity for marine applications.

Challenges and adoption outlook

According to LR’s assessment, hydrogen has the potential to deliver the ultimate goal of net zero emissions shipping by 2050, eliminating the industry’s GHG emissions and increasing air quality.

As with other zero-emissions solutions, there are technical, commercial and regulatory challenges to be overcome, but there are no roadblocks to hydrogen’s broad adoption in the shipping industry.

Despite the hurdles, the analysis points to near-term opportunities. Early adoption is most viable for short-sea trades such as ferries, tugs and coastal vessels where regular bunkering cycles reduce the constraints of onboard storage.

Fuel cell technologies show particular promise for these applications, supported by improving cost trajectories and advances in durability. Hydrogen-ready designs and hybrid fuel strategies also offer shipowners a practical route to futureproof assets.

Role of hydrogen in e-fuel pathways

As a necessary component of other e-fuels such as e-ammonia, e-methanol, and e-LNG, adoption of those other fuel pathways will bring benefits through incentivizing investment in green hydrogen production and research into hydrogen technologies.

Regulatory developments and safety considerations

On the regulatory front, global awareness of hydrogen’s role in decarbonization is supporting work on national hydrogen policies and relevant technical standards.

Within shipping, regulations for hydrogen are currently incomplete, but interim guidelines for the safe adoption of hydrogen are in active development at the IMO and are on course to bring greater clarity to support adoption. Such work is vital to understanding and managing fire and explosion risks as well as others arising from the use of hydrogen onboard.

Hydrogen has an important role to play in the maritime energy transition, but the pathway to scale is complex. Progress will depend on early investment, careful planning and a clear focus on safety

… said Padmini Mellacheruvu, LR’s Lead Technical Specialist in Cryogenic and Compressed Fuel Systems.

Infrastructure and investment requirements

The establishment of hydrogen infrastructure will require significant capital investment due to the lack of existing facilities and the specific requirements of hydrogen storage and transportation. Despite a few emerging bunkering projects, low-emissions hydrogen as a whole – including hydrogen produced via renewable-energy powered electrolysis (green hydrogen), biomass and fossil fuels with high levels of carbon capture and permanent storage (blue hydrogen) – accounted for less than 1% of global production in 2025, according to IEA.

Technical integration and cost challenges

The energy density of hydrogen presents integration challenges for larger vessels, requiring efficient propulsion systems and appropriate operating profiles to be viable. Broader challenges include the high price for prime movers, storage, and handling equipment, and the space requirements for LH2 tanks.

As production of relevant technologies scale up, equipment costs will fall, and innovations such as onboard ammonia cracking will expand the fleet for which hydrogen is a viable fuel choice.

Progress in technology and early deployment

Technological development is moving at a rapid pace and early experience with hydrogen in shipping is building, often in projects with state support.

Commercial viability and market drivers

The greatest challenge for hydrogen in shipping is its commercial viability, which will ultimately be dictated by the world’s commitment to decarbonization.

Higher carbon pricing under market-based measures will improve the competitiveness of hydrogen as a marine fuel, and drive increases in green hydrogen production capacity, improving availability.",https://safety4sea.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/shutterstock_1938738706.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 08:12:33.168517

Ocean carriers are passing ETS costs via dedicated surcharges, and many forwarders are now combining EU ETS and FuelEU Maritime charges into a single line item.
At the same time, price volatility in the EU carbon market introduces uncertainty.
Looking beyond the confines of the EU ETS, the broader regulatory landscape for European trade is evolving, increasing complexity for international businesses.
Why preparation matters in 2026 The full implementation of the EU ETS for maritime transport signals a broader shift in global trade regulation.","On January 1, 2026, the European Union’s Emissions Trading System (ETS) reached its full financial implementation for maritime transport, marking a structural shift in how ocean freight emissions are regulated and paid for. For shippers, carriers, and logistics providers moving cargo to and from Europe, the change translates directly into higher costs, new compliance obligations, and a sharper focus on emissions strategy.

The maritime sector has been gradually phased into the EU ETS since 2024, but 2026 is the first year in which shipping companies must surrender allowances for 100% of their verified emissions. This applies to all voyages within the EU and to 50% of emissions from voyages between EU and non-EU ports, significantly expanding financial exposure across major trade lanes.

What full EU ETS implementation means

The EU ETS operates on a cap-and-trade basis, requiring companies to pay for each tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent emitted. One EU Allowance permits the emission of one tonne of CO2e, with allowances purchased at auction or traded on the market. As the overall cap tightens annually, allowance supply falls, and prices are expected to remain structurally elevated.

For maritime transport, the system now covers not only carbon dioxide but also methane and nitrous oxide, both of which are particularly relevant for certain vessel types and fuel profiles.

This expansion broadens the emissions base used to calculate costs and removes much of the flexibility carriers previously had during the phase-in period. Shipping companies were required to cover 40% of emissions in 2024 and 70% in 2025. From 2026 onwards, that figure rises to 100%, meaning the ETS cost component embedded in freight rates and surcharges will increase materially, regardless of broader market conditions.

Cost pressure moves directly to shippers

For cargo owners, the most immediate impact is financial. Ocean carriers are passing ETS costs via dedicated surcharges, and many forwarders are now combining EU ETS and FuelEU

Maritime charges into a single line item. Industry estimates suggest ETS-related surcharges could rise by around 45% in 2026, driven both by full emissions coverage and higher allowance prices.

This shift forces shippers to reassess route planning, carrier selection, and contract structures. Lanes with high exposure to EU port calls are becoming materially more expensive, particularly for long-haul trades where half of voyage emissions fall within the ETS scope. At the same time, price volatility in the EU carbon market introduces uncertainty. Allowance prices are influenced by regulatory decisions, auction volumes, and market sentiment, making emissions a variable cost rather than a fixed compliance fee.

Lower-emission transport

As ETS costs rise, sustainability is no longer just a reporting or reputational issue. It becomes a commercial lever. Lower-emission transport options, such as sustainable maritime fuels or efficiency-based measures, can materially reduce ETS exposure and, in some cases, eliminate the surcharge altogether. For shippers, this reframes decarbonisation as a cost-avoidance strategy rather than a premium service.

Paying for emissions allowances is, in effect, paying a regulatory penalty, while fuel-based reduction mechanisms allow companies to reduce both emissions and total landed cost on certain lanes. This dynamic is accelerating demand for transparent emissions accounting, credible reduction certificates, and a clear linkage between fuel choices and ETS liabilities. Businesses without visibility into their emissions profile will struggle to manage costs effectively under the new regime.

Looking beyond the confines of the EU ETS, the broader regulatory landscape for European trade is evolving, increasing complexity for international businesses. Together, these measures extend climate accountability beyond transport into production, sourcing, and embedded emissions. For logistics and supply chain leaders, this requires closer coordination between sustainability, procurement, and transport functions, as well as stronger data integration across partners.

Why preparation matters in 2026

The full implementation of the EU ETS for maritime transport signals a broader shift in global trade regulation. Emissions are now a line-item cost, not an abstract future risk. Companies that continue to treat sustainability as a parallel initiative rather than a core operational variable will face margin pressure and competitive disadvantage.

Those that invest in emissions visibility, scenario planning, and lower-emission transport options will be better positioned to absorb regulatory shocks and maintain pricing control. As the EU tightens its climate framework through 2030, the ability to manage carbon exposure will increasingly separate resilient supply chains from vulnerable ones.

For businesses trading with Europe, 2026 is the point at which carbon becomes inseparable from cost, and where strategic decisions made today will define competitiveness in the decade ahead.",https://www.logisticsmiddleeast.com/cloud/2026/01/07/Untitled-design-2026-01-07T143340.388.png,N,,2026-01-08 05:56:46.211832

This partnership involves the shared use of second-generation biofuels, specifically UCOME (used cooking oil methyl ester), integrated into CMA CGM’s operational fleet.

This biofuel will be employed through the ACT+ offering, a low-emission transportation solution developed by CMA CGM, and complemented by DHL’s GoGreen Plus program. Both initiatives are designed to make it easier for customers to effectively reduce greenhouse gas emissions, especially those classified as Scope 3.

Measurable emission reductions

The acquired lot represents 8990 metric tons of UCOME, the use of which will prevent the emission of approximately 25,000 metric tons of CO₂ during maritime operations. This figure is equivalent to the removal of more than 5,500 diesel vehicles from circulation for one year, according to standard estimates.

CMA CGM will physically integrate the biofuel into its global maritime network, while DHL will apply its emissions allocation model through the Book and Claim methodwhich allows its customers to benefit directly from the reduction generated, even when their shipments are not associated with the specific vessel using the sustainable fuel.

Alternative fuels as a transition pillar

The use of UCOME reflects a growing trend in the transition to alternative marine fuels. alternative marine fuels. As a second-generation biofuel derived from waste, it contributes to both the circular economy and emissions reduction. In addition, it allows a reduction of up to 80 % of GHGs compared to conventional fossil fuels.

DHL and CMA CGM have reiterated that this is just one stage in a more ambitious long-term decarbonization plan. Both organizations have set 2050 as the horizon for achieving net zero emissions across their entire logistics chain.

Norwegian shipping major Odfjell reports it has initiated the first green corridor for service between Brazil and Europe, according to The Maritime Executive. The company emphasizes that this is not a one-off demonstration, but instead, with supply contracts, it becomes a long-term commitment to demonstrating what is possible today.

The company reports it has secured a supply of sustainable biofuel, which will be used as its chemical tankers make the 5,000-nautical-mile journey between Brazil and Europe. The corridor will operate 12 to 15 voyages per year, each lasting about 40 days.

""We do this to demonstrate that certified fuel, technology, and infrastructure are already available,"" says Harald Fotland, CEO of Odfjell. ""It may not be a perfect corridor yet, but a solid start. Its success depends on collaboration across the value chain, and we are committed to developing it further together with relevant stakeholders. Through this, we show that sustainable biofuel is a viable option for deep-sea shipping today.""

In Brazil, the currently available sustainable biofuel is the so-called certified B24. It is a blend of 24 percent renewable biodiesel derived from waste oil and 76 percent VLSFO (Very Low Sulfur Fuel Oil). The company reports it has established an offtake on the B24 biofuel blend in Rio Grande to secure long-term availability.

It notes that the Ports of Antwerp-Brugge, Rotterdam, and Rio Grande are also working together with the company to advance the green corridor through increased efficiency and optimized port-stay processes. It says the initiative aligns with the IMOs 2030 targets and the EUs Fit for 55 ambitions, and builds on the 2024 Norway-Brazil MoU to establish a green, transatlantic shipping corridor, as well as the companys goal to reduce emissions. Int notes it has already reduced its carbon intensity by more than 54 percent compared to the 2008 benchmark.

Odfjell is self-funding the project and moving ahead without subsidies. The company says it hopes the project will inspire broader industry action while it works with customers and partners to accelerate the transition to low-emission maritime transport.

The Norwegian-flagged vehicle carrier Höegh Australis arrived from Singapore as global maritime transport shifts toward cleaner energy solutions.

Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) Chief Pilot Captain Suleiman Bakari hailed the historic docking of the ship in an East African port, terming it a major milestone for the region.

The vessel, which measures 200 metres in length and 37.84 metres in width, has a capacity of 9,304 vehicles across 16 decks.

It sailed from Singapore and is set to discharge 824 motor vehicles and accessories destined for Kenya and neighbouring landlocked countries.

The one-year-old Roll-On/Roll-Off (Ro-Ro) ship operates on 98 per cent LNG fuel, using only two per cent conventional bunker fuel during engine start-up and specific operations, significantly reducing emissions compared to traditional marine fuel.

Bakari, who guided the vessel from the outer anchorage to berth number one while representing KPA Managing Director William Ruto, described Höegh Australis as the largest vessel ever to dock at a Kenyan port and commended its advanced green technology.

“This sits very well with the green port policy of KPA, which is aligned to Kenya’s national clean energy objectives,” said Bakari, commending Höegh Autoliners for trusting KPA to handle the vessel safely.

He reaffirmed KPA’s commitment to providing quality service to shipping and logistics firms.

Globally, LNG-powered vessels are increasingly being adopted in response to stricter International Maritime Organisation (IMO) environmental regulations, as LNG significantly reduces sulphur oxides, particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, and carbon dioxide emissions compared to heavy fuel oil.

Ship agent Socopao Kenya Ltd regional manager Satish Nair said the vessel’s arrival was a key milestone and urged stakeholders to embrace green energy, noting that LNG-powered ships have extremely low emissions.

Vessel captain Edgar Paul thanked KPA pilots for safely and smoothly guiding the ship to berth, noting that it was his first command of the LNG-powered vessel and his first call at the Port of Mombasa.",https://cdn.standardmedia.co.ke/images/articles/thumbnails/V4NjkoAsZ7oD8qEdNX3LMuegdjfp48A1OSmAsKRG.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 17:12:30.562920

Another established alternative fuel, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), saw 24 additional LPG-capable vessels ordered in 2025.
According to the H1 fuel quality report from LR’s Fuel Oil Bunkering Analysis and Advisory Service (FOBAS), the diversity and quality of biofuels are growing.
In April, LR’s Global Fuel Finder tool added biofuel availability and quality insights to the platform, helping users search, compare and analyse biofuels across global ports.
LR’s 2025 Engine Retrofit Report revealed the resurgence of LNG retrofits as shipowners sought immediate carbon reduction strategies to comply with regulatory requirements.","While global ordering activity softened compared to 2024 levels, orders for alternative-fuel capable vessels maintained strong momentum in 2025.

According to LR analysis of Clarkson’s data, in 2025, owners ordered 590 merchant and leisure vessels1 totalling 45.5m gt capable of operating on alternative fuels at delivery. The total alternative fuel capable orderbook now stands at 1,942 ships with 1,259 set to use LNG, 385 to use methanol, 139 using LPG, 53 vessels equipped to use hydrogen, 55 ethane, 45 ammonia, 22 biofuel and 4 nuclear-capable.

These vessels helped to grow the future alternative-fuel capable fleet, both in-service and on order, to 4,542 vessels (294.7mGT), equivalent to 2.1% of the global fleet and orderbook tonnage.

However, with the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) 2030 target on zero and near-zero emission energy potentially less than five years away, orders will need to accelerate further to meet the proposed 5%-10% of shipping energy consumption using new fuels. In European waters, FuelEU Maritime already compels operators to reduce their emissions and transition to new fuels.

Diversity of fuels expanded throughout the year

LNG retained its position as shipping’s most widely adopted alternative fuel in 2025 with 407 merchant and leisure vessel orders to be LNG-capable on delivery, a growing in-service fleet and sustained ordering interest, particularly within container, tanker and gas carrier segments. LR’s Fuel for Thought: LNG report confirmed LNG’s continued appeal for owners and operators, with immediate carbon dioxide emissions reductions relative to conventional marine fuels.

Two issues must be tackled for LNG to continue its strong appeal; to address methane slip, and accelerate the transition towards bio-LNG and synthetic LNG variants to align with longer-term decarbonisation objectives.

Methanol-capable vessels continued to attract attention in 2025, with 134 orders, accounting for a substantial proportion of the alternative-fuelled orderbook. In July, LR strengthened the regulatory foundation for methanol as a marine fuel by updating its Rules and Regulations for Ships Using Gases or Other Low-flashpoint Fuels to reflect evolving safety expectations and align with the IMO IGF Code (International Code of Safety for Ships Using Gases or Other Low-Flashpoint Fuels).

Another established alternative fuel, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), saw 24 additional LPG-capable vessels ordered in 2025. At present, LPG carrier vessels are the primary users of this fuel; however, there remains potential for adoption by other vessel types.

There were six orders for ammonia-fuel capable vessels. Progress during the year included further approvals in principle for ammonia-ready designs and ongoing work to address production capacity and regulatory advancement.

Hydrogen maintained momentum with 13 hydrogen capable orders and solid interest in specific segments, including passenger ferries and shallow-draft vessels. Fuel cells powered by hydrogen are viewed as options for achieving zero or near net-zero tank-to-wake emissions. LR’s updated guidance for the installation of fuel cells on ships incorporates recent regulatory updates and technical developments related to fuel cell technology in the maritime sector.

Biofuels also strengthened their position as a practical, near-term solution for emissions reduction, particularly within existing fleets, with 11 biofuel-capable newbuild orders (up from eight in 2024). According to the H1 fuel quality report from LR’s Fuel Oil Bunkering Analysis and Advisory Service (FOBAS), the diversity and quality of biofuels are growing. Uptake of FAME-based biofuel blends, notably B30 RF, is increasing across ports including Singapore, Algeciras and Antwerp.

In April, LR’s Global Fuel Finder tool added biofuel availability and quality insights to the platform, helping users search, compare and analyse biofuels across global ports. Earlier in the year, operator John H Whitaker Tankers launched Whitchampion, the first bunker tanker certified to load, carry and blend FAME B100 biofuel on board. The IMO also issued improved guidance on carrying biofuel blends by bunker ships, with interim guidelines outlining new requirements for alternative fuel systems, operational risk assessments, and the handling of biofuel blends.

While nuclear remains a longer-term and highly regulated prospect, LR continued to explore its potential applications within the maritime sector. A partnership with Microsoft (via Azure OpenAI) will see generative AI used to accelerate permitting/licencing processes for maritime nuclear applications. LR also joined a global cross-industry pledge to triple nuclear energy capacity by 2050 and published Navigating Nuclear Energy in Maritime, the industry’s first guidance document for nuclear-powered shipping.

Retrofit momentum grows

Beyond fuel choice, LR’s Retrofit Research Programme offered valuable perspectives into how existing tonnage can adapt to evolving energy systems. LR’s 2025 Engine Retrofit Report revealed the resurgence of LNG retrofits as shipowners sought immediate carbon reduction strategies to comply with regulatory requirements. However, despite the industry making strides, a significant shortage of supply-side incentives threatens to delay progress.

While the number of retrofit-capable yards has increased to around 16 shipyards, mainly in China and the Middle East, retrofit capacity is currently at approximately 465 vessel conversions annually, well below the projected peak requirement of more than 1,000 conversions per year, according to the report.

Hull optimisation and energy-saving devices (ESDs) rose in strategic importance, with 28.5% of vessels on order choosing to install at least one ESD. LR’s Energy saving devices retrofit report showed that high-efficiency propellers can deliver fuel savings of between 3% and 10%, and popular devices such as rudder bulbs can achieve 3.5% reductions.

At Nor-Shipping, LR granted the world’s first recognised enhanced approval to Jotun’s SeaQuantum Skate coating and HullSkater cleaning system, making it the first fully integrated hull cleaning and coating solution to be certified by a classification society.

The number of ships fitted with wind-assisted propulsion (WAPs) devices continues to grow, with bulk carriers and tankers leading the way. LR played a central role in the successful delivery of BRANDS HATCH, the world’s first newbuild Aframax tanker equipped with WAPs.

Performance verification was another area where LR made its mark. Working with Anemoi Marine Technologies and bound4blue, LR helped standardise methodologies for calculating wind-assisted power contributions and verifying fuel savings during normal operations. Fuel savings of between 5% and 15% are now routinely reported, and in some cases, gains of up to 30% have been achieved. With EU ETS costs rising and GHG intensity targets tightening, these savings translate directly into a competitive advantage.

Where 2025 leaves the industry

Despite these advances, LR’s Global Maritime Trends Barometer indicates that global energy infrastructure and workforce readiness still lag behind both technological innovation and regulatory ambition. The report benchmarking shows that while newbuild orders and retrofit readiness have improved, energy transition scores ranged from just 24% to 30% alignment with 2030 decarbonisation targets.

Energy production systems are still predominantly fossil fuel-centric, and significant underinvestment persists in workforce development and port infrastructure. Progress is tangible and accelerating, but not yet comprehensive enough to meet the scale and urgency of international climate goals.

Looking forward to 2026 and beyond, the alternative fuels landscape is more diverse than ever, and its complexity continues to deepen. No single solution has emerged as the definitive answer, and each option presents its own set of unique challenges and dependencies.

In this period of critical change, success will belong to those who move swiftly, embrace a broad portfolio of strategies, and remain sharply attuned to the evolving realities of regulation, supply chains and technological change. The future will be shaped by those who not only adapt, but also offer leadership, helping to build a resilient, sustainable and transformative maritime industry.

Norway leads with the largest volumes primarily intended for the maritime sector, followed by Spain, Finland, and Denmark.
The research indicates that the maritime sector is likely the largest potential buyer of e-methanol and e-ammonia.
Strong demand signals from the maritime sector would provide producers with the crucial assurance of a robust market for renewable fuels.","Norway, Spain, Finland, and Denmark are at the forefront of renewable synthetic fuel production that can be used in maritime transport. However, regulatory uncertainty is holding back most projects in the planning phase, according to Transport & Environment (T&E). The EU should introduce more ambitious rules to boost the sector and create jobs.

A lack of regulatory certainty is preventing most projects from moving beyond the planning stage.

Spain, Denmark, Norway, and France are leading the production of renewable synthetic fuels suitable for maritime transport, according to a new analysis by T&E. However, regulatory uncertainty is stopping most projects from advancing beyond planning. T&E recommends that the EU adopt more ambitious synthetic fuel requirements for the maritime sector to ensure that projects are implemented, which would create jobs and improve Europe’s energy security.

T&E’s 2025 update of its Synthetic Fuels Observatory for Maritime Transport identified 80 green hydrogen and synthetic fuel projects that could be used to power ships, representing over 4 million tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe) by 2032. However, T&E found that only 240,000 tonnes of oil equivalent—less than 5%—are allocated to the maritime sector. Only 25% of these projects have reached final investment decision (FID) or are operational, highlighting how regulatory uncertainty is preventing projects from advancing.

Some countries are emerging as potential suppliers of marine synthetic fuels. Norway leads with the largest volumes primarily intended for the maritime sector, followed by Spain, Finland, and Denmark. The Kassø project by European Energy, which supplies e-methanol to Maersk, became operational in 2025 and is both the first marine synthetic fuel project and the largest of its kind in Europe.

The research indicates that the maritime sector is likely the largest potential buyer of e-methanol and e-ammonia. For e-ammonia, for example, maritime transport is cited as a potential customer for double the project volume compared to the fertilizer and chemical industries. Strong demand signals from the maritime sector would provide producers with the crucial assurance of a robust market for renewable fuels.

Bosco Serrano Valverde, head of sustainable fuels at T&E Spain, said: “The largest sustainable maritime project was launched this year. This proves it is possible, but scaling up projects remains a challenge. Current maritime targets are not ambitious enough to attract investor funding. In addition to demand incentives, fuel producers need upfront capital. Developing a strong synthetic fuels sector could reinforce Europe’s industrial leadership and reduce the continent’s dependence on imported fossil fuels.”

Clean technology producers have called on the EU to strengthen support for sustainable fuels for maritime transport in Europe.

EU ETS performance and 2025 Carbon Market Report

The 2025 Carbon Market Report, published by the European Commission in December, shows that the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) continued to drive significant emissions reductions in the power and industrial sectors throughout 2024. The system has played a key role in incentivizing decarbonization while generating substantial revenues to support investment in the clean energy transition.

The EU ETS is a cornerstone of the EU’s climate policy. Built on the “polluter pays” principle, it places a cap and a price on emissions from the energy, industrial and maritime transport sectors, as well as parts of the aviation sector. Emissions covered by the EU ETS represent approximately 40% of the EU’s total greenhouse gas emissions.

Emissions reductions and progress towards 2030 targets

According to the report, emissions from power and industrial installations covered by the EU ETS are now around 50% below 2005 levels. The system remains on track to achieve its 2030 emissions reduction target of –62%.

Notably, 2024 marked the first year that CO₂ emissions from maritime transport were included in the EU ETS, representing a major expansion of the system’s scope.

Maritime transport coverage and compliance

The EU ETS now covers:

100% of emissions from voyages between two ports within the European Economic Area (EEA) and emissions generated while ships are at an EEA port; and

50% of emissions from voyages departing from or arriving at ports outside the EEA.

Compliance in the first year was high. By the 30 September deadline, shipping companies surrendered allowances covering more than 99% of their required emissions, demonstrating a smooth introduction of the maritime component of the EU ETS.

In 2025, shipping companies were required to surrender allowances for 40% of their verified 2024 emissions, with a permitted 5% reduction for ice-class ships. To safeguard the environmental integrity of the system, any shortfall between verified emissions and surrendered allowances for 2024 and 2025 will be cancelled by Member States from future auction volumes.

Greenhouse gases covered under the EU ETS

Beyond CO₂, the EU ETS also covers other greenhouse gases from specific sectors, including:

Nitrous oxide (N₂O) from the production of nitric, adipic and glyoxylic acids and glyoxal;

Perfluorocarbons (PFCs) from primary aluminium production.

From January 2026, methane (CH₄) and nitrous oxide (N₂O) emissions from maritime transport will also fall under the EU ETS.

EU ETS revenues and clean transition funding

EU ETS revenues remain a major source of funding for Europe’s clean transition. In 2024, the system generated €38.8 billion, bringing total revenues since inception to over €250 billion.

These funds are primarily distributed to Member States to support climate action, clean energy deployment and innovation. Additional funding is channeled to the Innovation Fund, the Modernisation Fund, and the Recovery and Resilience Facility, including the REPowerEU plan.

Phase-in of maritime compliance costs

Maritime transport has been introduced with a gradual phase-in of compliance obligations:

2024 emissions: companies paid for 40% of compliance costs

2025 emissions: compliance increased to 70%

From 1 January 2026: companies must pay 100% of compliance costs

The regulation applies to ships of over 5,000 gross tonnage (GT) calling at EU ports and requires payment for emissions on a per-voyage basis.

Allowance cancellation and auction adjustments

Under Articles of the ETS Directive, when fewer allowances are surrendered than verified emissions during the phase-in period, the corresponding number of allowances must be cancelled from auctioning.

For 2024, a total of 54,243,768 allowances will be cancelled in 2026 through an amendment to the auction calendar.

Increase in allowances for non-co₂ maritime emissions

Article 9 of the ETS Directive provides that, from January 2026, the total quantity of allowances will be increased to reflect the inclusion of non-CO₂ greenhouse gas emissions from maritime transport. These additional allowances will be auctioned in 2026 and allocated to the Innovation Fund via an updated auction calendar.

Adjustments to the EU ETS Cap in 2026

The report also outlines key adjustments to the EU ETS cap effective from 2026, driven by:

A planned rebasing of the cap

The expanded scope to cover additional maritime GHG emissions

An updated list of small emitters excluded from the system

The EU ETS cap defines the maximum total emissions permitted within a trading phase and corresponds to the total number of allowances issued, with one allowance equal to one tonne of CO₂ equivalent (CO₂e). The cap declines annually, ensuring alignment with the EU’s long-term emissions reduction targets and providing market certainty on allowance scarcity.

In 2026, the cap will be:

Reduced by 27 million allowances in line with the 2030 target; and

Increased to reflect the inclusion of CH₄ and N₂O emissions from maritime transport.

In total, 1,185,420,090 allowances will be issued in 2026 for electricity and heat generation, industrial production and maritime transport, alongside 24,903,076 allowances for aviation.

What the EU ETS Extension means for maritime transport

The extension of the EU ETS to maritime transport builds on existing ETS rules and the Maritime Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV) Regulation. During 2024 and 2025, only CO₂ emissions were covered, with CH₄ and N₂O included from 2026.

Shipping companies reported 89.8 million tonnes of verified CO₂ emissions in 2024. The surrender obligation is phased in, requiring:

Surrender in 2025 for 40% of 2024 emissions

Surrender in 2026 for 70% of 2025 emissions, with additional reductions for ice-class vessels

Mitsui O.S.K. Lines, announced that it has signed two Heads of Agreements with JERA for a time charter contract covering two very large gas carriers designed for ammonia transport. Under this agreement, the vessels will transport low-carbon ammonia produced at JERA-invested Blue Point Complex in Louisiana, U.S., to JERA’s Hekinan Thermal Power Station in Hekinan City, Aichi Prefecture. This initiative marks the beginning of Japan’s first large-scale low-carbon ammonia transport project.

Since November 2022, MOL has held ongoing discussions with JERA on collaboration in fuel ammonia transport .

This agreement builds upon those discussions and seeks to establish a commercial-scale low-carbon ammonia value chain.

Ammonia is mainly used as a raw material for fertilizers and chemicals, and is recognized as a next-generation clean energy source that emits no carbon dioxide during combustion. It also has the potential to provide decarbonization solutions across various sectors, including use as fuel for power plants and ships, as well as serving as a hydrogen carrier . With these applications, substantial future demand is projected.

The MOL Group positions environmental strategy as a core pillar of its management plan, “BLUE ACTION 2035,” and has set the goal of achieving net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050 under the “MOL Group Environmental Vision 2.2.” The group aims to contribute to the realization of a decarbonized society by building a comprehensive ammonia value chain. This entails actively participating in its development-where large-scale future demand is expected through adoption as a fuel-while at the same time further enhancing its expertise in the safe, reliable transport of ammonia.

Leveraging experience and expertise as one of the world’s largest shipping companies, MOL will expand its diverse social infrastructure businesses, technologies, and services centered on marine transport. As a group, it will respond to the wide-ranging needs of its customers and advance as a global social infrastructure company-sustaining people’s daily lives from the blue oceans, ensuring a prosperous future, and delivering new value to all stakeholders.",https://cyprusshippingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MOL-and-JERA-sign-heads-of-agreements-for-the-charter-of-ammonia-carriers.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 06:12:20.572585

In September 2025, the Union Cabinet approved the revised SBFAS, categorising electric and hybrid vessels as “Specialised” vessels.
“The effective subsidy for green vessels has been reduced by five percentage points, eroding the incentive for clean technology adoption,” Thandasherry said.
Sanjiv Walia, Chief Executive Officer of the Shipyards Association of India, which represents private shipyards across the country, echoed these concerns.
The Shipyards Association of India has taken up the issue with the Shipping Secretary, seeking a review of the guidelines and amendments to provide targeted incentives for green vessels under SBFAS.","NEW DELHI : Small private Indian shipyards have expressed concern over the Union government’s decision to reduce financial incentives for electric, solar and other green vessels from 25 per cent to 15 per cent under the revised Shipbuilding Financial Assistance Scheme (SBFAS), warning that the move could slow the adoption of clean technologies and hamper India’s maritime decarbonisation efforts.

The concerns follow the issuance of the SBFAS Guidelines on December 25, under which industry stakeholders fear that reduced support for green propulsion technologies may dampen innovation, discourage investment, and weaken India’s push towards decarbonising coastal shipping and inland waterways.

Sandith Thandasherry, Founder of Kochi-based Navalt, India’s largest solar-electric boat manufacturer, described the revised scheme as a setback for the country’s electric vessel ecosystem. “SBFAS 2025 is one step forward and two steps back for India’s electric boat revolution,” he said. Navalt currently operates 40 solar-electric boats, has 37 under construction, and built Aditya, India’s first solar ferry, in 2017.

Under the original Shipbuilding Financial Assistance Policy (SBFAP) of 2016, incentives were primarily targeted at ocean-going vessels above 24 metres, with subsidy levels tapering from 20 per cent in 2016–19 to 11 per cent by 2025–26. Smaller vessels and electric boats were largely excluded from meaningful support.

In September 2025, the Union Cabinet approved the revised SBFAS, categorising electric and hybrid vessels as “Specialised” vessels. The scheme offers financial assistance of 15 per cent for the first ₹100 crore of contract value and 25 per cent for amounts beyond that threshold. However, industry sources noted that most electric vessels, typically priced between ₹20 crore and ₹80 crore, effectively receive only the 15 per cent subsidy—placing them on par with conventional diesel-powered vessels without any additional green incentive.

While contracts signed between September 2025 and March 2026 may still opt for the earlier SBFAP incentive of 20 per cent, approvals thereafter will be governed by SBFAS. “The effective subsidy for green vessels has been reduced by five percentage points, eroding the incentive for clean technology adoption,” Thandasherry said.

Sanjiv Walia, Chief Executive Officer of the Shipyards Association of India, which represents private shipyards across the country, echoed these concerns. He pointed out that despite India’s commitments to the International Maritime Organization’s Net-Zero 2050 targets, the revised guidelines do not provide any additional uplift for electric, solar or green vessels. “On the contrary, there is an effective reduction in subsidy, which could discourage the adoption of green technologies across ocean-going, coastal and inland segments,” he said.

Walia highlighted that nearly 90 per cent of India’s 11,000-km inland waterways network relies on small vessel operations, where electric and solar vessels can reduce emissions by 80–100 per cent and significantly cut dependence on imported diesel. He added that most small and medium shipyards in Kerala, Goa and Gujarat specialise in ferries, tugs and workboats with contract values below ₹100 crore.

Using a consequential LCA, which accounts for emissions avoided through the displacement of carbon-intensive materials in end products by those produced with captured carbon, emissions savings were 7.9% across the value chain.
“Under the current attributional treatment recommended in the IMO guidelines, utilisation pathways can appear to deliver no emissions savings because avoided emissions from product displacement are excluded.
GCMD assessed the ghg savings of its value chain against permanent storage of the captured CO2.
In a hypothetical scenario where onboard carbon capture rates are boosted to 40%, carbon capture and permanent storage leads to emissions savings of 21%, while utilisation of the captured carbon brings 34% emissions savings.","The emissions reductions impact of deploying carbon capture technologies in the maritime industry may be understated using accounting methods recommended by IMO guidelines, limiting incentives for shipowners to invest in such systems, according to a new report.

The regulatory issue was one of the findings of a GCMD report on its pilot project to demonstrate a full value chain for onboard capture carbon dioxide; the project involved the capture and offload of over 25 tonnes of CO2 on Evergreen containership Ever Top.

Using an attributional lifecycle analysis (LCA) of the project’s carbon value chain gave a net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions increase of 8.6% across the value chain when compared to a baseline of not using onboard carbon capture and storage (OCCS). The attributional LCA looks at the carbon value chain from a shipowner’s perspective and its scope ends at utilisation of the carbon, assuming the CO2 will be permanently stored, thus omitting the full impact of utilisation in end products.

The carbon captured onboard Ever Top was used as feedstock to recycle steel slag into post-carbonated slag (PCS) and precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC). PCC is a common component in the production of building materials like concrete — its usual production methods involve a carbon-intensive process using limestone.

Using a consequential LCA, which accounts for emissions avoided through the displacement of carbon-intensive materials in end products by those produced with captured carbon, emissions savings were 7.9% across the value chain.

“Under the current attributional treatment recommended in the IMO guidelines, utilisation pathways can appear to deliver no emissions savings because avoided emissions from product displacement are excluded. This in turn provides no incentive for shipowners and operators to invest in the substantial capital expenditure and operational expenses required to deploy OCCS,” the report said.

Efficiency improvements

Analysis of the pilot scheme identified several inefficiencies that had limited ghg emissions savings across the value chain, inefficiencies that could be addressed in future OCCS deployments.

The lack of a waste heat recovery system onboard Ever Top meant the fuel penalty when running the OCCS system was 5%, compared to 1.5% if a waste heat recovery system had been in place. Transport and logistics emissions for the value chain were high, including 26% from hose purging and 52% from the 2,200 km overland transport of the captured liquid CO2 by truck from port to processing plant.

Eliminating these and other “first-time” infefficiencies, by installing a waste heat recovery system and transporting the LCO2 overland by pipeline, boosts the emissions savings using a consequential LCA from 7.9% to 17.8%, the report said.

GCMD assessed the ghg savings of its value chain against permanent storage of the captured CO2. In a hypothetical scenario where onboard carbon capture rates are boosted to 40%, carbon capture and permanent storage leads to emissions savings of 21%, while utilisation of the captured carbon brings 34% emissions savings.

Professor Lynn Loo, CEO of GCMD, said the project “shows that onboard carbon capture, when thoughtfully integrated with utilisation pathways, can deliver real emissions reductions today while we continue to scale up low- and zero-carbon fuels. It also highlights how we measure and account for those reductions matter. If our frameworks continue to ignore avoided emissions and displaced carbon, we risk disincentivising investments in solutions that can meaningfully bend the emissions curve.”",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltdcfe6aab5515629e/bltb007cf58f2cb5eba/6862a60e3b0bdb354b242cbb/Evergreen-CO2-STS-Credit-GCMD.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2026-01-06 20:57:27.107661

The initiative will see both marinas supply Sustainable Bio Yacht Fuel (SBYF), produced from recycled cooking oil collected across hotels, residences, and Emaar’s integrated developments.
Dedicated refuelling points at DMYC and CMYC will give yacht owners convenient access while supporting lower-carbon marine leisure activities.
Lootah Biofuels, which specialises in biodiesel blends derived from used cooking oil, will manage the collection, processing, and supply of SBYF.
Yousif Saeed Lootah, CEO of Lootah Biofuels, commented: “We are proud to partner with Emaar to bring Sustainable Bio Yacht Fuel to Dubai’s Leisure Marine sector.","Emaar Hospitality Group and Lootah Biofuels have rolled out a sustainable marine biofuel solution at Dubai Marina Yacht Club and Creek Marina Yacht Club, marking one of the GCC’s first commercial applications of low-carbon, recycled-oil fuel for leisure vessels. The initiative demonstrates how locally sourced biofuels can reduce emissions in the marine sector while supporting the UAE’s Net Zero 2050 goals.

The initiative will see both marinas supply Sustainable Bio Yacht Fuel (SBYF), produced from recycled cooking oil collected across hotels, residences, and Emaar’s integrated developments. The process converts waste oil into a marine-grade biofuel, offering yacht owners a more environmentally friendly refuelling option directly at their home marinas.

Nicolas Belleton, of Emaar Hospitality Group, said: “Sustainability is at the heart of how we operate across our Marinas and Hospitality assets. By introducing Sustainable Bio Yacht Fuel, we are giving our members a tangible, responsible choice that aligns with the UAE’s Net Zero 2050 goals, while setting a new standard for eco-innovation in the leisure marine sector.”

SBYF will initially be rolled out in a phased approach to ensure fuel quality, logistical reliability, and long-term sustainability. Dedicated refuelling points at DMYC and CMYC will give yacht owners convenient access while supporting lower-carbon marine leisure activities.

Lootah Biofuels, which specialises in biodiesel blends derived from used cooking oil, will manage the collection, processing, and supply of SBYF. Yousif Saeed Lootah, CEO of Lootah Biofuels, commented: “We are proud to partner with Emaar to bring Sustainable Bio Yacht Fuel to Dubai’s Leisure Marine sector. This initiative demonstrates how locally sourced waste materials can be transformed into high-value energy solutions, supporting both environmental and operational progress across the UAE.”

The introduction of SBYF builds on DMYC’s existing environmental credentials, which include Fish Friendly and Clean Marina accreditations, and its sustainable drinking water programme that converts atmospheric humidity into potable water. Emaar said the new fuel offering reinforces its practical approach to decarbonisation and sustainability across its Marina portfolio, focusing on actionable, locally sourced solutions.

“Our goal is to make sustainability actionable, not just aspirational. This partnership is a concrete step toward a cleaner, greener marine experience for all our guests,” Belleton added.",https://www.oilandgasmiddleeast.com/cloud/2026/01/06/Emaar-Lootah-BioFuels-1-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 01:56:46.529467

A seamless, scalable alternative to fossil fuels MASH Makes biofuel is produced by heating agricultural residues at high temperatures without oxygen.
Unlike emerging fuels like green hydrogen or ammonia, which require new infrastructure, MASH Makes biofuel integrates directly with existing systems.
For every tonne of biofuel produced, MASH Makes also generates 1.8 tonnes of biochar, a stable, carbon-rich material applied to soil.","Global shipping company DS NORDEN and renewable energy company MASH Makes have successfully completed a commercial vessel trial using biofuel produced from a carbon-negative process.

The vessel operated on a roundtrip voyage from Singapore to Brazil, successfully using 65 tonnes of fuel blend with 20% MASH Makes biofuel in its auxiliary engine.

The trial confirmed that MASH Makes’ biofuel works as a drop-in solution — compatible with existing systems and able to reduce fossil fuel use in specific marine applications.

“This trial proves that MASH Makes’ biofuel is suitable for marine engines, and it marks an important milestone towards bringing the fuel into our operation,” said Henrik Røjel, head of decarbonisation and climate solutions, NORDEN.

The results point to a practical path for shipowners to cut emissions without waiting for new infrastructure.

If the new agreement by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) to cap and price excess emissions globally is ratified in October 2025, MASH Makes offers a solution that enables shipowners to start significantly reducing their emissions well before the agreement takes effect in 2028.

A seamless, scalable alternative to fossil fuels MASH Makes biofuel is produced by heating agricultural residues at high temperatures without oxygen.

The resulting bio-oil is comparable with ISO8217 standard fossil fuels. Unlike emerging fuels like green hydrogen or ammonia, which require new infrastructure, MASH Makes biofuel integrates directly with existing systems. It also offers flexibility for blending, including with VLSFOs and MGOs, without costly retrofits.

“Our biofuel meets the technical requirements of the shipping industry and can be used in unmodified engines. Our independent analysis shows that MASH Makes’ biofuel production process is carbon negative, which is driven by the permanent carbon sequestration achieved through the co-produced biochar and its use in sustainable agriculture, added Maria Jamarillo, senior analyst, boundless impact research & analysis.

For every tonne of biofuel produced, MASH Makes also generates 1.8 tonnes of biochar, a stable, carbon-rich material applied to soil.

MASH Makes biofuel is produced through pyrolysis, which converts agricultural residues into renewable energy.

The company’s facility in Karnataka, India processes 23,700 tonnes of agricultural waste annually, producing 3,400 tonnes of bio-oil and large quantities of biochar.

Demo flights and early partnerships

Malaysia Airlines’ public SAF story began with demonstration flights and collaborative deals.

In 2022, the airline operated its first passenger flight using Neste-produced SAF supplied locally by PETRONAS, running a blend derived from waste and residue feedstocks — a practical test that proved both technically and commercially instructive.

Diversified value chains A particularly interesting scenario lies with multinational companies that operate vessels, and trade commodities, across multiple markets.","TIME FOR AMMONIA?

Research shows that ammonia is likely to become the most competitive fuel through the 2030s. If half the sector is running on ammonia in the 2040s, then fleets still running on methanol or LNG are expected to have a 30 to 50 percent higher cost of operating. That is not commercially sustainable.

So why are people not jumping on the ammonia bandwagon as fast as they can? At UCL’s Energy Institute, our multidisciplinary team works to answer these types of questions. And the answer to who will move first seems to fall into six key areas:

1. Progressive investment

When governments make transition part of their industrial strategy, we see powerful shifts.

In Scandinavia, geographical suitability, domestic gas resources, engineering skills, and strong industrial policy aligned to see Norway and Sweden lead the LNG transition. Now, Scandinavian firms are leading the way again with firms like Höegh Autoliners ordering ammonia-ready vessels.

2. Existing carriers

While policy sets the stage, existing infrastructure and cargo types also shape who moves first, and a clear group of early adopters are those already carrying cleaner fuels as cargos.

It’s easier for a vessel to use its cargo as fuel than to start from scratch. It also simplifies crewing and reduces the energy supply chain, such as bunkering.

3. High-value cargos

Market dynamics also matter. Consumers are often willing to pay a premium for carbonneutral products, meaning vessels transporting high-value goods can absorb the cost of zero-emissions shipping more easily.

One initiative, ZEMBA (Zero Emissions Maritime Buyers Alliance), is already showing how buyer influence can accelerate change, and their first tender for low-emission shipping was won by Hapag Lloyd in 2024.

4. Geographical advantages

Some nations also already have a hydrogen advantage, typically places with high sun or wind that have good existing maritime infrastructure. Countries like Australia and Saudi Arabia are likely to become major hydrogen (or ammonia) producers, making fleet conversion easier to realize.

Services most suited to make this change are those that operate between just two ports, allowing vessel design and refueling to be optimized. For instance, BHP has recently signed contracts for two ammonia dual-fueled bulk carriers for the Australia to China iron ore route.

5. Diversified value chains

A particularly interesting scenario lies with multinational companies that operate vessels, and trade commodities, across multiple markets. These firms can spread the risk of decarbonization across their value chains.

A great example is Japanese import/ export firm Itochu, which has the flexibility to experiment with low-emission solutions and is now investing in ammonia at scale.

6. Disruptors

And finally, let’s not dismiss the power of the individual. History shows us that disruptors can reshape entire industries, just think Steve Jobs and the iPhone. While shipping has long been seen as a risk-averse sector, leaders are starting to emerge with a “let’s do this” mindset, such as Alex Saverys at CMB.

But what is the point of all this theory? I hope it will help companies identify whether they are in a position to move first. The evidence clearly shows that the transition to renewable energy is well underway, and those that get ahead of the game are likely to be the longterm winners.",https://oceannews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMarEST_logo_CMYK.jpg,N,,2026-01-05 16:12:06.429314

Global Head of Clarksons Research, Steve Gordon, said: “With the geopolitical and industry consensus on emissions regulation stalling for the moment and continued challenges around ‘green’ fuel pricing and availability, trends in alternative fuel uptake have stabilised across 2025 with the share of orderbook tonnage adopting alternative fuel steady at 47% (end 2024: 50%, end 2015: 10%).”

Container ships dominated new orders in 2025 and continued to lead in alternative fuel contracting: 62% of boxship capacity will be alternative fuel capable. Ship sectors that can use cargo as fuel, such as LNG and LPG carriers, or have consistent trading patterns and supportive stakeholders such as container and pure car carrier operators, continue to have the highest take-up rates, the Clarksons analysis revealed.

LNG continues to be the leading alternative fuel of choice, accounting for 80% of orders, a 5% increase on the 2024 figure. This comes against a backdrop of continuing concern over the availability and bunkering facilities for other fuels such as green methanol and ammonia, Clarkson said. The analysts recorded 256 contracts for LNG-capable vessels (195 excluding LNG carriers), 66 methanol-capable ships, five ammonia units, 21 capable of using LPG, and nine hydrogen-ready vessels. Ships ordered with battery power numbered 171.

In terms of deliveries, a record number of 484 ships of almost 34 million gross tons (GT) joined the fleet, bringing the alternative fuel-capable fleet to 9% of the global fleet in GT terms. Taking into account this new record and the 47% of ships on order that are set to be alternative-fuelled, Clarkson estimates that more than 20% of the world fleet will be able to operate on alternative fuels by 2030.

Meanwhile, the take-up energy-saving technologies (EST) continues at pace. About 14,200 vessels are now fitted with energy-saving devices of various types, representing about 46% of the fleet. They include rudder bulbs, propeller ducts, Flettner rotors, wind kites, and air lubrication systems.

Climate negotiations at the International Maritime Organization (IMO) over the Net-Zero Framework have reached a serious deadlock—one that could significantly shape the future of international shipping and transportation. Economic pressure from the United States, including threats of punitive tariffs and port restrictions, has led to a shift in position by countries controlling more than half of the world’s maritime transport capacity.

According to reports from reputable maritime industry sources, these pressures have increased the likelihood of suspending the final vote on the Net-Zero Framework, placing all 176 IMO member states on the brink of a critical decision. This decision will determine the fate of the most important environmental agreement in the international transportation sector.

The Net-Zero Framework: A Threat or an Opportunity for Maritime Transport?

The Net-Zero Framework is the result of more than five years of intensive negotiations and aims to gradually reduce carbon emissions in the shipping industry, reaching net-zero emissions by 2050. The maritime sector produces approximately one billion tons of carbon dioxide annually, accounting for a significant share of global emissions.

The framework sets the following interim targets:

A 20% reduction in emissions by 2030

A 70% reduction in emissions by 2040

However, opposition from oil-producing countries, combined with increasing U.S. economic pressure, has disrupted the balance of negotiations and cast doubt on the implementation of this plan—directly affecting international shipping services and logistics costs.

A Divide in Europe: Concerns of Maritime Powers

Greece, Cyprus, and Malta—three major maritime nations in Europe—have announced their intention to vote against the official position of the European Union. Together, these countries control nearly 40% of Europe’s commercial fleet and are concerned about losing competitiveness if strict carbon pricing policies are implemented.

This unprecedented rift highlights the direct impact of climate-related decisions on global supply chains and the shipment of goods to ports around the world.

Suspension of Negotiations: A Likely IMO Scenario

The IMO Secretariat has proposed a “procedural suspension” as a temporary solution—allowing the postponement of the vote without setting a specific deadline. If the framework is fully rejected, it cannot be reintroduced for at least two years.

Even if approved, countries representing more than 50% of global tonnage could formally object and halt its implementation, raising serious concerns about policy stability in international shipping and transportation.

Postponement of the MEPC Meeting and the Future of Maritime Policy

The extraordinary session of the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC), originally scheduled for October 2025, has been postponed for one year and will resume in 2026. During this period, intersessional working groups will continue drafting implementation guidelines.

The Net-Zero Framework consists of two main pillars:

The Global Marine Fuel Standard

The Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions Pricing Mechanism

Nevertheless, the practical enforcement of these policies depends on achieving political consensus at the international level.

Conclusion: Implications for Multimodal Transport and Global Trade

During a recent meeting in London, they indicated agreement on an interim emissions reduction target for 2030, though specifics on the magnitude of emissions cuts were not disclosed. The IMO is currently debating a more ambitious climate agenda that seeks to not only halve shipping emissions by 2050 but also establish a net-zero target.

Net-zero emissions involve reducing greenhouse gas emissions as close to zero as possible, balancing any remaining emissions through natural processes, such as reabsorption by oceans and forests. Absolute zero-emissions mean complete decarbonization without relying on offsets or carbon capture. The shipping industry is exploring alternative fuels like hydrogen and ammonia, which offer low-carbon solutions but also pose safety challenges due to their flammability and toxicity.

Max Mejia, president of the World Maritime University, emphasized the need for enhanced training for seafarers to proficiently manage these new technologies and fuels. The Philippines is poised to upskill its maritime workforce to facilitate this necessary transition. However, achieving consensus across global shipping companies and training centers is essential for successful adoption of these guidelines.

At a recent climate summit, 32 countries backed an absolute zero-emissions goal by 2050, with several Asian nations and major shipping stakeholders like Singapore supporting the net-zero target. In contrast, countries such as China, India, and Indonesia resisted calls for more ambitious goals. The global shipping sector is responsible for approximately 90% of international trade and emits about one billion tonnes of greenhouse gases annually, equating to the emissions produced by 121 coal power plants.

Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos, Jr. has actively called for enhancing educational programs to equip Filipino seafarers for the upcoming shift from traditional fuels to green ammonia between 2030-2040. In his speech at a Manila conference, he stressed the necessity of adapting the shipping industry to incorporate new technologies, including retooling existing ships and building modern vessels.

The European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) had previously considered banning Filipino seafarers from European ships due to training inadequacies but later recognized the progress made by Philippine authorities in upgrading training programs. EMSA is now investing over $4 million to further enhance the training framework for Filipino seafarers, highlighting a commitment to improving maritime training standards.",https://maritimefairtrade.org/wp-content/uploads/pwa/icon-192.png,N,,2026-01-04 01:56:25.673965

Currently, a significant meeting is underway in London, focused on advancing the global maritime sector toward achieving a mid-century net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions target. This week, the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) Intersessional Working Group on GHG Reduction (ISWG-19) is exploring options to price emissions from fossil fuel usage in maritime operations.

The discussions aim to clarify positions on three primary carbon pricing options: a crediting mechanism, a ‘strong’ levy, and a ‘weak’ levy. This debate sets the stage for a broader meeting of the Marine Policy Environment Committee (MEPC) next week, which will delve into carbon pricing alongside two other significant tracks: establishing a Carbon Intensity Indicator for ship efficiency standards and implementing a green fuel standard to lower the GHG intensity of marine fuels.

Carbon Pricing Mechanisms

All three proposed carbon pricing options rest on a Global Fuel Standard that dictates the maximum GHG intensity permissible over time, measured in CO2 equivalent per gigajoule of energy for maritime fuels. The ongoing discussions are part of a lengthy process initiated by the UN’s maritime arm to address the sector’s GHG emissions, owing to its exclusion from the Kyoto Protocol and subsequent climate agreements, which instead delegated regulatory authority to the IMO and the International Civil Aviation Organization.

Aviation has already adopted a carbon pricing scheme known as the Corsia decarbonization system. In contrast, shipping has yet to finalize a pricing approach. Recent observations indicate a shift in the EU’s position that aligns with a compromise “bridging proposal” favoring a credit mechanism. This change comes with backing from several countries, including Singapore, China, and Brazil. If the EU supports the credit mechanism, analysts suggest that the levy option may be sidelined in favor of this approach.

Perspectives on Carbon Pricing Options

Environmental NGO Seas At Risk notes that while the levy offers an equitable solution, the credit trading mechanism could facilitate an energy transition, particularly for zero or near-zero GHG emission fuels expected to be produced mainly in developing nations. However, concerns about revenue instability and market unpredictability linger. Most smaller and poorer developing countries advocate for the non-carbon credit levy, arguing it could generate approximately $1,500 billion by 2050, compared to only $150 billion projected under a credit mechanism.

Urgency for Agreement

Reaching a consensus in the coming weeks is critical, as the IMO aims to meet an October 2025 deadline for agreeing on mid-term measures as part of its revised GHG Strategy established in 2023. The maritime industry currently accounts for about 2% of global GHG emissions, and the IMO’s target to achieve net-zero “around” 2050 includes non-binding interim targets for 2030 and 2040.

While some refined proposals for mid-term measures have garnered support, experts caution that definitive breakthroughs may not occur this year. Delays extending into 2026 or beyond could push decisions close to three decades after the Kyoto talks transitioned responsibility for maritime GHG emissions to the IMO. Additionally, the implementation of adopted measures may take effect 16 months after MEPC approval, under a “tacit acceptance” procedure, emphasizing the pressing need for timely actions within the maritime sector.",https://maritimefairtrade.org/wp-content/uploads/pwa/icon-192.png,N,,2026-01-03 20:56:37.596814

This is the second consecutive time India has topped the vote tally, placing it alongside major maritime nations, such as Germany, France, Canada, the United Arab Emirates, Australia, Spain, Sweden, the Netherlands, and Brazil. The support India received reflects its emerging role as a committed, forward-looking voice in global maritime governance.

Why This Seat Matters for India

The IMO, a United Nations (UN) agency, works to make shipping safer and cleaner, and reduce pollution from ships, in line with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The IMO Assembly, comprising all member states, is its top decision-making body. The Assembly meets every two years to approve the work programme and budget, and to elect the Council. The Council acts as the executive body, steering the Organization’s work between Assembly meetings. Council members are elected under three categories: Category A includes countries most involved in providing international shipping services; Category B covers those with the largest stake in global seaborne trade; and Category C represents countries with specific maritime interests, ensuring broad geographic balance.

Holding a Category B seat allows India to play an integral role in shaping discussions on key issues, including shipping safety, decarbonisation, digitalisation, and seafarer welfare.

Around 95 percent of India’s trade by volume and about 70 percent by value is carried by sea. Moreover, India has been steadily expanding its maritime ambitions through initiatives such as the Sagarmala programme, Maritime Vision 2030, and Maritime Amrit Kaal Vision 2047, while aligning closely with global standards. A seat on the IMO Council complements these efforts and gives India a platform to support practical, balanced, and inclusive rules at a time when the global maritime sector is changing rapidly. It also provides India with a platform to learn from international best practices, share its experience, and bolster its own policies. The backing India received in the elections reflects confidence in its sound and consistent approach.

India’s presence on the Council underscores its growing role as a responsible global maritime player, particularly in supporting capacity-building and knowledge-sharing across the Global South. Holding a Category B seat allows India to play an integral role in shaping discussions on key issues, including shipping safety, decarbonisation, digitalisation, and seafarer welfare. As India expands its ports, develops shipbuilding capacity, and strengthens green logistics networks, its involvement in global decision-making ensures that its national priorities align with the international rules-based order and that the voice of the Global South is heard.

Supporting a Fair and Sustainable Transition

Climate action remains central to the IMO’s agenda as global shipping works towards net-zero emissions by 2050. India’s re-election to the IMO Council allows it to continue shaping this transition, while emphasising that decarbonisation must be effective, affordable, and fair, especially for developing maritime nations facing high compliance costs. India’s own experience gives weight to this position, enabling it to argue for practical pathways that balance climate goals with development needs, supported by innovation and targeted investments.

India’s green shipping efforts are already evident across its ports and maritime sector. Initiatives such as the Harit Sagar Guidelines and the Harit Shrey incentive scheme are encouraging cleaner vessels and lower emissions, supported by renewable energy usage, clean-fuel pilots, electric harbour craft, and progress in ship recycling. Work on green and digital shipping corridors, along with the Green Port Performance Index, is helping align port operations with climate resilience, efficiency, and environmental protection.

With a long coastline and an expanding port network, resilient and future-ready port cities are a strategic priority for India. Its Council role also reinforces its efforts to address regional environmental risks in the Indian Ocean, including pollution, ballast water discharge, and rising shipping traffic. It also enables India to combine its domestic reforms with international engagement to support cleaner maritime growth.

India’s hands-on experience, including anti-piracy patrols in the Gulf of Aden and sustained engagement in the Western Indian Ocean, lends credibility and strengthens regional maritime awareness through the Information Fusion Centre-Indian Ocean Region (IFC-IOR) and partnerships with the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (QUAD) members, the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) countries, and African coastal states.

Reinforcing Connectivity and Maritime Security Cooperation

More than 90 percent of global trade moves by sea, making the IMO key to maintaining global economic stability. As India’s role in maritime logistics and shipbuilding grows, staying closely involved in regulatory processes becomes increasingly important. Being on the IMO Council enables India to contribute to discussions on frameworks such as the International Ship and Port Facility Security (ISPS) Code and casualty investigation guidelines, helping guide how countries respond to threats at sea, from piracy to humanitarian crises. India’s hands-on experience, including anti-piracy patrols in the Gulf of Aden and sustained engagement in the Western Indian Ocean, lends credibility and strengthens regional maritime awareness through the Information Fusion Centre-Indian Ocean Region (IFC-IOR) and partnerships with the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (QUAD) members, the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) countries, and African coastal states.

India’s Council role also allows it to push for strategic and sustainable maritime connectivity. Initiatives like SAGAR (Security and Growth for All in the Region), green and digital shipping corridors with Singapore and Rotterdam, and cooperation with Japan’s Quality Infrastructure Partnership, along with emerging trade routes such as the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC) and maritime links with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC), enhance trade and connectivity, help reduce emissions, and make supply chains more resilient.

Through its global partnerships, engagement with regional actors, shipbuilding initiatives, and its role at the IMO, India can bridge the divide between developed and developing countries, build consensus, strengthen maritime security, and support a fair and steady global trading system.

At the same time, India remains aware of the impact of China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and of rising maritime risks in the Indo-Pacific, the South China Sea, and the Red Sea. Through its global partnerships, engagement with regional actors, shipbuilding initiatives, and its role at the IMO, India can bridge the divide between developed and developing countries, build consensus, strengthen maritime security, and support a fair and steady global trading system.

Placing People at the Centre of Maritime Development

Nearly 40 percent of the world’s population lives within 100 km of a coastline, making people central to sustainable maritime development. As major ports expand in close proximity to urban areas, local communities increasingly bear the environmental and social costs. Vulnerable groups such as fishers, informal workers, women, and migrant labourers are frequently the most affected. Emerging port cities in the Global South handle millions of cargo units each year, yet they continue to face governance challenges. Port-led growth can transform urban landscapes, affecting access to waterfronts, traditional livelihoods, and public spaces. For port expansion, digitalisation, and green transitions to truly benefit both cities and communities, it will be important to balance economic goals, policy needs, and environmental safeguards with the aspirations of local communities, while encouraging multistakeholder collaboration to ensure that growth benefits all.

India could strengthen its focus on community wellbeing at the IMO and champion these priorities while integrating local needs with broader development goals. Building on its existing initiatives, India can promote greater integration of local knowledge, indigenous perspectives, heritage-sensitive planning, and coordinated governance to create sustainable coastal regions. As one of the world’s largest suppliers of seafarers, India has a strong stake in safeguarding their welfare. Through initiatives such as Sagar Mein Samman, India supports training, mental health, gender equality, safety, and humane working conditions for seafarers. Its partnership with the International Seafarers’ Welfare and Assistance Network strengthens collaboration on infrastructure, facilities, and wellbeing for seafarers and onshore employees, as well as support for their families, aligning with global standards. Together, these initiatives give India a strong platform at the IMO to promote people-centred maritime development and inclusive policies for the Global South.

India can promote greater integration of local knowledge, indigenous perspectives, heritage-sensitive planning, and coordinated governance to create sustainable coastal regions.

Conclusion

India’s re-election to the IMO Council reflects its growing strength and its increasingly significant role in the maritime sector, especially as developing countries seek a stronger voice in global rule-making. This election hands India a timely opportunity to influence the future of maritime and ocean governance. As global trade patterns shift, India’s presence on the Council adds stability and direction. India’s growing port network and national initiatives enable it to demonstrate how maritime development can enhance efficiency, support local communities, and protect the environment, offering examples other developing countries can follow.

Over the next two years, India can further help deepen cooperation, build regional partnerships, encourage knowledge transfer, and promote a safe, sustainable, and inclusive maritime order. Most importantly, this presents India with another chance to shape the global maritime discourse, guided by a pragmatic and equitable long-term vision.

Heike Deggim, Director of IMO’s Maritime Safety Division, elaborated on the organization’s focus in the Arctic and its engagement with the Council.

The pressing issues that attract IMO’s attention include ensuring the safety, security, and sustainability of shipping in the Arctic. IMO aims to mitigate risks related to search and rescue operations, pollution response, maritime safety, and environmental protection in this fragile region. The organization’s Polar Code establishes mandatory requirements for vessels operating in polar environments, enhancing safety standards beyond existing regulations. However, there is recognition that additional measures are needed, particularly for boats not covered by the Polar Code, such as fishing vessels and pleasure yachts. IMO has invited its Member States to voluntarily implement Polar Code safety measures across these vessels.

Broader maritime concerns also occupy IMO’s focus, including the enhancement of navigational charts, establishment of search and rescue facilities, improvements in satellite and radio communications, and the creation of port reception facilities for operational waste. A significant aspect of IMO’s mission is contributing to global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from shipping, aiming for at least a 50% reduction in emissions by 2050. This initiative is aligned with the Paris Agreement and supported by various practical projects aimed at fostering technology development and operational best practices, particularly in developing countries.

In the Arctic, Member States are intensifying efforts to address black carbon emissions from ships and are advocating for extending the current ban on heavy fuel oil from the Antarctic to Arctic waters. Furthermore, addressing marine litter and microplastics is a key initiative; IMO is collaborating with the United Nations Environment Program to combat sea-based sources of marine litter.

Following its accreditation, IMO has engaged with the Arctic Council through formal channels, building upon past informal collaborations on projects such as the “Guide on Oil Spill Response in Ice and Snow Conditions.” Current collaborations involve the Arctic Shipping Best Practice Information Forum, enhancing the effectiveness of the Polar Code. Upcoming meetings will continue to strengthen the communication between IMO Member States and the Arctic Council.

Furthermore, IMO is actively developing specifications for ships’ equipment in polar waters, focusing on guidelines for navigation and life-saving appliances for vessels not covered by the Polar Code. Recent sessions have led to the creation of guidelines targeting pleasure yachts and fishing vessels operating in these regions.",https://maritimefairtrade.org/wp-content/uploads/pwa/icon-192.png,N,,2026-01-03 10:12:43.527029

India could strengthen its focus on community wellbeing at the IMO and champion these priorities while integrating local needs with broader development goals. Building on its existing initiatives, India can promote greater integration of local knowledge, indigenous perspectives, heritage-sensitive planning, and coordinated governance to create sustainable coastal regions. As one of the world’s largest suppliers of seafarers, India has a strong stake in safeguarding their welfare. Through initiatives such as Sagar Mein Samman, India supports training, mental health, gender equality, safety, and humane working conditions for seafarers. Its partnership with the International Seafarers’ Welfare and Assistance Network strengthens collaboration on infrastructure, facilities, and wellbeing for seafarers and onshore employees, as well as support for their families, aligning with global standards. Together, these initiatives give India a strong platform at the IMO to promote people-centred maritime development and inclusive policies for the Global South.

India can promote greater integration of local knowledge, indigenous perspectives, heritage-sensitive planning, and coordinated governance to create sustainable coastal regions.

Conclusion

India’s re-election to the IMO Council reflects its growing strength and its increasingly significant role in the maritime sector, especially as developing countries seek a stronger voice in global rule-making. This election hands India a timely opportunity to influence the future of maritime and ocean governance. As global trade patterns shift, India’s presence on the Council adds stability and direction. India’s growing port network and national initiatives enable it to demonstrate how maritime development can enhance efficiency, support local communities, and protect the environment, offering examples other developing countries can follow.

Over the next two years, India can further help deepen cooperation, build regional partnerships, encourage knowledge transfer, and promote a safe, sustainable, and inclusive maritime order. Most importantly, this presents India with another chance to shape the global maritime discourse, guided by a pragmatic and equitable long-term vision.

Both companies will continue to explore opportunities to scale up lower-carbon fuel usage and develop collaborative approaches to decarbonize international supply chains.

What is GoGreen Plus?

DHL's GoGreen Plus products provide decarbonized solutions across DHL's core offerings by leveraging sustainable fuels and low carbon technology. GoGreen Plus products are based on true value chain decarbonization. This is enabled by the 'book & claim' approach. Book & claim enables DHL to directly replace fossil fuels with sustainable fuels within the logistic company's network and allocate environmental benefits to paying customers, even when their shipments are not physically transported with the assets using these fuels. GoGreen Plus allows DHL's customers to reduce their indirect Scope 3 emissions in their value chain arising from upstream and downstream transportation and distribution. It also helps customers with voluntary reporting of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and progress against their decarbonization targets.

In December 2025, the board of directors of National Agency for Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels (ANP) authorized the Petrobras to market marine diesel with content of biofuel renewable, regularizing operations already underway and strengthening the decarbonization agenda for maritime transport in Brazil.

The decision has retroactive effects.This provides legal certainty to contracts signed since November and allows for the continuation of commercialization until the agency concludes the final review of the regulation governing fuels for maritime use. The ANP's approval represents a significant step towards introducing lower-carbon solutions in the maritime sector, while maintaining rigorous technical and regulatory standards.

ANP authorizes Petrobras and guarantees legal security for marine diesel.

The authorization granted by ANP allows the Petrobras continue selling what's called Verana Diesel, a marine diesel obtained through co-processing of 5% vegetable oil, characterizing the addition of renewable biofuel to the traditional formulation.

The central point of the decision lies in legal certainty. Since sales began before express authorization from the regulatory agency, Petrobras requested a special authorization with retroactive effect. After technical and regulatory analysis, the ANP (National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels) determined that the measure was necessary to regularize the existing situation and provide predictability to the market.

Furthermore, the authorization establishes clear criteria for the continued commercialization of the product until the final regulatory review is completed, avoiding regulatory uncertainty and contractual interruptions.

How Petrobras developed marine diesel with renewable biofuel.

The development of the new marine diesel It happened in a planned and transparent way. In August, the Petrobras presented to ANP The fuel production and marketing plan. In October, the first production took place at the Presidente Bernardes Refinery (RPBC), located in Cubatão, in the state of São Paulo.

Sales began in November, before formal authorization, which led to a subsequent request for regularization. This movement reflects the technical maturity of the product. and the growing demand for fuels aligned with energy transition strategies.

Diesel Verana stands out for incorporating renewable biofuel without requiring significant changes to the logistics infrastructure or the vessels' engines, a factor considered strategic for its gradual adoption in the naval sector.

Regulatory gap regarding marine diesel prompted special authorization from ANP.

The need for special authorization arose from a regulatory gap. The Resolution ANP No. 903/2022, which establishes the specifications for fuels used in waterborne transport, does not foresee the addition of biofuels to marine diesel..

Given this scenario, the revision of the standard was included in ANP Regulatory Agenda 2025-2026, under the supervision of director Pietro Mendes, with completion scheduled for 2026. Until then, the special authorization serves as a transitional instrument to allow regulated innovation.

This approach avoids paralyzing initiatives aligned with decarbonization.while preserving the agency's role as guarantor of fuel quality and safety.

ANP's technical assessment confirms the quality of co-processed marine diesel.

The technical area of ANP evaluated in detail the formulation presented by Petrobras and concluded that the product meets the quality standards required for conventional marine diesel..

The technical report also identified regulatory precedents, such as special authorizations previously granted for bunker B24, which reinforced the consistency of the decision adopted.

This point is essential for the market.because it demonstrates that the introduction of renewable biofuel It does not compromise fundamental technical requirements, such as performance, stability, and operational safety of the vessels.

Alignment of marine diesel with international IMO guidelines.

Another key factor in the decision was the alignment of the initiative with the guidelines of International Maritime Organization (IMO), which guide the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in global maritime transport.

A ANP acknowledged that the co-processed diesel from Petrobras This aligns with those guidelines by reducing the carbon intensity of the fuel without requiring immediate structural changes to the naval fleet.

This international alignment strengthens Brazil's position.This signals that the country is keeping pace with the main global decarbonization trends in one of the most challenging sectors of the energy transition.

Petrobras' strategic role in the naval energy transition.

A Petrobras has been expanding its activities in the development of fuels with a lower environmental impact, and the marine diesel on renewable biofuel It fits directly into this strategy.

Co-processing in existing refineries allows for incremental environmental gains, leveraging already installed assets and reducing technological risks. Furthermore, it creates a regulatory learning environment that contributes to the evolution of the Brazilian regulatory framework.

The initiative also sends a clear signal to the market.This shows that there is room for innovation in the fuel sector, provided it is accompanied by rigorous technical criteria and constant dialogue with the ANP (National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels).

Impacts of ANP authorization on the marine diesel market

In practice, the decision of ANP generates direct effects for the Brazilian market of marine dieselAmong the main impacts are the regularization of contracts signed by Petrobras, the continued supply of co-processed fuel and the reduction of regulatory uncertainties.

For shipowners and operatorsThe measure expands the options for lower-carbon fuels without requiring immediate changes to vessel operations. For the regulated sector, it reinforces predictability and institutional confidence.

Regulatory review by ANP and the future of marine diesel with renewable biofuel.

Despite the progress represented by the special authorization, the final regulations are still under development. The revision of the Resolution... ANP No. 903/2022 must permanently discipline the marine diesel on renewable biofuel and possibly other low-carbon fuels, including synthetic fuels.

According to the director's order Symone AraújoAccording to the case's rapporteur, the authorization aims to regularize the existing situation, provide legal certainty, and establish clear parameters until the regulatory review is completed, scheduled for 2026.

A regulatory framework for the decarbonization of maritime transport.

The authorization granted by ANP à Petrobras for the sale of marine diesel on biofuel renewable It goes beyond a one-off administrative decision. This is a significant milestone in the evolution of Brazilian energy regulation., by balancing innovation, legal certainty and alignment with international guidelines.",https://clickpetroleoegas.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Petrobras-Diesel-Maritimo.jpg,N,,2026-01-02 14:57:12.807375
