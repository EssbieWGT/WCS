the corridor is expected to support approximately 12–15 voyages annually, with each voyage lasting around 40 days.
To ensure long-term fuel availability, an offtake agreement for B24 sustainable biofuel has been established in Rio Grande.
The initiative builds on a 2024 Norway–Brazil memorandum of understanding aimed at establishing a green transatlantic shipping corridor.
This new green shipping corridor is the result of Norway’s cooperation with Brazil on more climate-friendly shipping,” said the Norwegian Minister of Climate and Environment, Anders Bjelland Eriksen.","In the UK, Safety4sea reported that Odfjell has established a green shipping corridor between Brazil and Europe, enabling vessels to complete the 5,000-nautical-mile route with significantly reduced emissions through the use of certified B24 biodiesel.
