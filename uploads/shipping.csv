the corridor is expected to support approximately 12–15 voyages annually, with each voyage lasting around 40 days.
To ensure long-term fuel availability, an offtake agreement for B24 sustainable biofuel has been established in Rio Grande.
The initiative builds on a 2024 Norway–Brazil memorandum of understanding aimed at establishing a green transatlantic shipping corridor.
This new green shipping corridor is the result of Norway’s cooperation with Brazil on more climate-friendly shipping,” said the Norwegian Minister of Climate and Environment, Anders Bjelland Eriksen.","In the UK, Safety4sea reported that Odfjell has established a green shipping corridor between Brazil and Europe, enabling vessels to complete the 5,000-nautical-mile route with significantly reduced emissions through the use of certified B24 biodiesel.

In close cooperation with Port of Amsterdam, EcoLog is developing a terminal for the import of liquid hydrogen and the export of liquid CO₂ in the Afrikahaven.
Through the Amsterdam terminal, hydrogen can be supplied to customers in the region, elsewhere in the Netherlands and in Germany, for use in sectors such as industry, mobility, shipping, and aviation.
Alongside the development of the terminal, EcoLog is also working on specialized vessels for the transport of liquid hydrogen.
Earlier this year, an agreement was signed with partners from Oman, Germany, and the Netherlands to enable the import of liquid hydrogen.","EcoLog has taken an important step in the development of a liquid hydrogen import terminal in the Port of Amsterdam.

This week, the company signed an agreement in Tokyo with a group of technology partners that will supply equipment for both the future import terminal and the vessels that will transport the hydrogen.

The consortium partners,Ebara Corporation, Fukui Seisakusho, Kobe Steel, and TB Global Technologies, will provide equipment and technical solutions for EcoLog’s liquid hydrogen vessels as well as for the planned import terminal in Amsterdam.

In close cooperation with Port of Amsterdam, EcoLog is developing a terminal for the import of liquid hydrogen and the export of liquid CO₂ in the Afrikahaven.

It will be the first terminal of this scal worldwide. The terminal is expected to become operational around 2030 and, in its initial phase, will have an annual throughput capacity of 200,000 tonnes of liquid hydrogen and 1.8 million tonnes of liquid CO₂.

Liquid hydrogen can be transported efficiently and safely via pipelines, inland shipping, rail, and road.

Through the Amsterdam terminal, hydrogen can be supplied to customers in the region, elsewhere in the Netherlands and in Germany, for use in sectors such as industry, mobility, shipping, and aviation.

Alongside the development of the terminal, EcoLog is also working on specialized vessels for the transport of liquid hydrogen.

Both maritime transport and terminal operations require highly specialized equipment.

EcoLog has therefore entered into a framework agreement with its partners to jointly develop and integrate this equipment into the vessels and the terminal. This includes, among other things:

Pumps for loading and unloading liquid hydrogen

Safety relief valves to reduce tank pressure in emergency situations

Heat exchangers to convert liquid hydrogen into gaseous form, enabling onward transport via pipelines after arrival

Marine loading arms for the safe loading and unloading of vessels

Based on the current planning, the company is working towards realization of the terminal in 2030.

The import of green hydrogen is essential for the development of the European hydrogen economy and for the decarbonization of industry.

Earlier this year, an agreement was signed with partners from Oman, Germany, and the Netherlands to enable the import of liquid hydrogen.

The development of the terminal in the Port of Amsterdam aligns with this international cooperation and with the broader ambition to supply North-West Europe with green hydrogen.",https://container-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/EL2501-S01A-PH1-250616.jpg,N,,2025-12-20 04:57:09.692176
