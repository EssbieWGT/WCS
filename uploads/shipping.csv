With GoodFuels B15, FincoEnergies provides shipowners with a practical, reliable drop-in solution at a time when the need for concrete decarbonization measures continues to grow. Now that the regulatory framework for higher FAME blends has been clarified, FincoEnergies provides inland and coastal shipping companies with a tangible step towards more sustainable operations they can take today.

The regulatory landscape for inland shipping is changing

From January onwards, REDIII raises the sustainability requirements for the Dutch maritime sector, increasing the urgency for practical decarbonization options. Shipowners are expected to demonstrate real and measurable CO₂ reductions, yet uncertainty around FAME blends above 7% previously created hesitation, even as demand for accessible and effective alternatives continued to rise.

That uncertainty has now been resolved. Recent European guidance (ES-TRIN and CESNI-EUROMOT) confirms that higher FAME blends are fully permitted in PRE-CCR, CCR I, and CCR II engines, without additional emission testing, provided that engine manufacturer requirements are met. Dutch authorities have also clarified that the Fuel Quality Directive’s (FQD) 10% FAME limit does not apply to the inland shipping sector, since vessels do not operate on EN590 road diesel. This removes a key barrier, making GoodFuels B15 a straightforward next step.

GoodFuels B15: practical, scalable and impactful

GoodFuels B15 is a drop-in biofuel blend that delivers measurable CO₂ reduction while fitting seamlessly into existing vessel operations. Fully aligned with the needs of the inland shipping sector, the blend meets the specifications defined by Koninklijke Binnenvaart Nederland (KBN), ensuring it matches day-to-day practice on board. GoodFuels B15 builds on FincoEnergies’ extensive experience with sustainable marine fuels and insights from its B15 inland shipping trial, which shows strong, stable performance in real-world conditions.

Bas Goedegebuure, responsible for inland shipping at FincoEnergies, said, “With GoodFuels B15, we offer shipowners a sustainable biofuel blend that performs as they expect: stable throughout the year, truly sustainable and fully compatible with their existing engines and operations. It’s a concrete step towards decarbonization they can take today, without complexity or disruption.”

GoodFuels B15 key benefits:

15% FAME and 85% regular diesel

Parameters meet EN590 diesel expectations

Filter Blocking Tendency (FBT) testing for additional assurance

Drop-in properties with no infrastructure or engine modifications required

Truly sustainable; produced from feedstocks that are 100% certified as waste or residue, with no negative land-use impact like deforestation and no competition with food production.

GoodFuels B15 provides shipowners with a practical, ready-to-use sustainability solution simple, scalable and available today.

Built on collaboration

GoodFuels B15 was developed through close collaboration between FincoEnergies and Argent Energy. As one of Europe’s leading producers of waste-based biodiesel, Argent Energy contributed deep feedstock expertise and technical knowledge. FincoEnergies leveraged its long-standing experience in sustainable marine fuels and operational understanding of the inland marine sector. Together, these strengths resulted in a stable, reliable and high-quality FAME blend that meets the technical expectations of Dutch shipowners.

Jan Jaap Rodenburg, chief commercial officer at Argent Energy, said, “Our collaboration with FincoEnergies brought together the best of both worlds: our expertise in producing high-quality waste-based biodiesel and their deep understanding of the inland marine sector has resulted in a B15 blend that is technically robust, operationally reliable, and fully aligned with shipowners’ expectations.”

Ready for today’s operations

GoodFuels B15 is now available to the Dutch maritime industry, utilizing a bunkering process identical to that of regular diesel. The FAME blend is already available at Oliehandel Terlouw, along with higher FAME blends up to B30 for shipowners aiming for even more CO₂ reduction.

Decarbonizing the industry together

FincoEnergies believes that true decarbonization is only possible when the entire sector collaborates. Its mission is to make the transport and logistics chain climate-neutral step by step, with solutions that can be applied immediately in daily operations. The company works towards a future in which shipowners, shippers and logistics partners have easy access to reliable, affordable and impactful CO₂ reduction solutions.

Funded by the European Union delegation in Panama and Costa Rica, the study will deliver an understanding of the technical, financial and policy conditions required to make the Panama–Algeciras corridor a practical green shipping route. Ricardo will lead the study, in collaboration with the Algeciras Bay Port Authority, the Panama Canal Authority, the Panama Maritime Authority, and subcontractor with Maritime & Logistics Consulting Group, S.A.

As part of the study, Ricardo will:

Confirm feasible fuel options and operational implications to define realistic pathways for transitioning trans-oceanic container shipping to zero- or near-zero-emission energy sources.

Evaluate the business case for the corridor. This will consider capital costs of alternative-fuel vessels compared to conventional ships, the fuel price differential between zero/near-zero and fossil fuels, and operating costs linked to compliance with regulatory schemes such as the IMO Net-Zero Framework, FuelEU Maritime, and the EU ETS.

Identify enabling policy and financial interventions and initiatives that could help bridge cost gaps and accelerate deployment, and measures to strengthen the emerging zero-emission fuel supply chain.

Green shipping corridors are specific routes where vessels use low-emission propulsion. Ricard, who has led a number of such studies to date, welcomes the study and the significance that this could have on global shipping.

Ricardo’s Associate Director for Transport Policy, Alexi Pons, said: “The Panama–Algeciras green shipping corridor is not only significant because of its trans-oceanic distance, but also because it connects two major global bunker hubs with strong potential to become green hubs. Developing green shipping infrastructure along this route could deliver transformative benefits for both regions. We’re very excited to be working with the Algeciras Bay Port Authority, the Panama Canal Authority, the Panama Maritime Authority and the EU on this project.”

The results of the study are expected to be delivered by April 2026.

The victory reflects Egypt’s sustained presence in the global maritime system and its growing capacity to support maritime safety and efficiency.

Officials said the election is the culmination of a state-led comprehensive plan to modernize Egyptian ports, improve operational efficiency, and enhance the competitiveness of the nation's transport and logistics infrastructure.

The development comes amid a significant boom in the maritime transport sector, which the Cabinet noted has increased international confidence in Egypt’s regional and global role as a transit hub.

The infographics detailed international recognition of Egypt’s port development, noting that the country climbed four spots in the UNCTAD Shipping Connectivity Index to reach 19th place in the third quarter of 2025.

This marked an improvement from 23rd place in the same period in 2024. Egypt also ranked 23rd globally in the World Economic Forum’s 2024 Ports Efficiency Index. Additionally, the World Bank ranked Port Said first regionally and third globally in the 2024 Container Terminal Performance Index, while Lloyd's Register listed both Port Said and Alexandria among the top 100 ports worldwide for 2025.

In a record-breaking development, Ain Sokhna Port entered the Guinness World Records for the deepest man-made harbor basin on land, reaching a depth of 19 meters.

Despite regional challenges, port traffic showed marked growth in 2024. Cargo handling capacity increased 5.2% to 183 million tons, up from 174 million tons in 2023, while cargo throughput rose 16% to 210 million tons. Ship calls increased by 12.5% to reach 16,200, and container throughput rose 7.1% to 9 million 20-foot equivalent units (TEUs).

The government has successfully attracted six of the world’s largest shipping lines and seven major operators. Furthermore, an Egyptian-Italian Ro-Ro shipping line now operates between the ports of Damietta and Trieste, further integrating Egypt into European trade routes.

Egypt invested 129 billion Egyptian pounds (EGP) in seaport development between 2014 and 2024, focusing on several key strategic hubs. At Alexandria Port, the EGP 7 billion ""Tahya Misr"" multi-purpose terminal was constructed with a capacity of 12 million to 15 million tons, supported by new transport axes and a modern grain logistics station at berth 3/85.

Meanwhile, East Port Said completed 8.4 kilometers of quays, with an additional 6.2 kilometers currently underway. Notably, the Suez Canal Container Terminal performed the first green fuel refueling operation for ships in Africa and the Middle East in August 2023.

The development plan also extended to the Red Sea and Damietta. Upgrades to Nuweiba and Safaga ports included new warehouses and heavy truck yards totaling nearly EGP 140 million.

At Ain Sokhna, five basins were dredged to a 19-meter depth alongside the construction of 18 kilometers of quays and 30 kilometers of railway lines. Finally, Damietta Port established a new multi-purpose terminal and significant barrier expansions, with a total investment for these projects reaching EGP 4.8 billion.",https://sis.gov.eg//media/705557/605124543-1438123951691354-3357298854046081326-n.jpg,N,,2025-12-29 14:56:45.273438

It allows for shipowners to adapt to the regulation in an environment of scarce availability of alternative fuels.

The EU’s FuelEU Maritime regulation has been in force since the beginning of 2025. The aim of the regulation is to cut European maritime greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by encouraging renewable and low-carbon fuel use.

The regulation applies to all ships of 5000 gross t and over calling at EU ports, regardless of their flag. At the end of 2025, shipowners must show that the carbon intensity of the fuel used during the year has reduced by 2%. In time, the required reduction will increase incrementally until it reaches 80% by 2050. Non-compliance results in fines based on GHG emissions.

The good news for gas-powered shipowners is that running ships on LNG mostly covers the emission cuts needed during the first years of the regulation. This is because LNG’s lifecycle carbon dioxide emissions are 20% lower than traditional maritime fuels such as marine gas oil (MGO). However, many other shipowners face concerns about fleet lifespan and compatibility, as well as the availability of alternative fuels as supplies and bunker locations remain limited.

Luckily, the FuelEU Maritime regulation allows shipping companies to voluntarily pool emissions between vessels to support compliance efforts. In this framework, vessels with surplus compliance can offset the GHG intensity requirements of other vessels by sharing compliance.

Emissions may be pooled among two or more ships verified by the same body, including ships managed by different companies, provided certain conditions are met. One requirement is that the total pooled compliance must remain positive; pooling cannot result in a greater deficit after emissions are combined.

To sum up, pooling enables shipowners who have the ability to reduce emissions to also lower emissions on behalf of those who are unable. This benefits everyone – including compliance generators and off-takers as well as the climate.

Bio-LNG use enables generous emission reductions

Pooling can also be offered as a service. This means that the pool of vessels is managed by a third party that ensures that the pool is in balance and all ships within the pool are allocated the right amount of emission reductions required by the regulation at the end of the year. For instance, Nordic energy company, Gasum, offers pooling as a service to all ships calling at EU ports. In Gasum’s pool, designated vessels run on bio-LNG in order to generate compliance on behalf of under-compliant vessels.

Gasum has partnered with shipping companies such as Viking Line and Wallenius Sol to use their LNG-powered vessels as compliance generators in Gasum’s pool by switching the vessels to using bio-LNG.

Transport sector eyeing limited renewable fuel resources

The FuelEU Maritime package is not the only regulatory development shaking up the maritime sector in the coming years. Although decisions were postponed in October 2025, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) still has its own strategy and ambitious targets for reducing maritime emissions globally, with a horizon towards 2028 for the first cuts and a net-zero emission target in 2050.

With continuously tightening regulations, as well as increasing demand for low-emission transports from end customers, demand for biofuels is set to increase dramatically in the maritime sector in coming years. In addition, aviation and land transport are also vying for globally limited renewable fuel resources.

Combining all these factors together, experts estimate that there might be a significant shortage of biofuels and other alternative fuels from 2030 onwards. Faced with this challenge, Gasum has been developing a comprehensive biogas value chain and LNG infrastructure to meet the needs of customers going forward.

Peace of mind with secured bio-LNG availability

Although biofuel availability might limit the capacity and scalability of commercial FuelEU Maritime pools, once a shipowner has signed on to a third-party’s pool, measures can be put in place to guarantee peace of mind. For example, Gasum ensures that customers are always compliant at the end of the verification period – even if this means paying a penalty on behalf of the customer.

For now, pooling is the right answer for shipping companies wanting an easy and reliable way to fulfil the requirements of the regulation. However, during the course of the next 20 years, as the regulation tightens, shipowners need to think about what their strategy will be to tackle the 80% reduction in emissions demanded by 2050.

Under the agreement, the two logistics giants will jointly use 8,900 metric tons of a lower-carbon biofuel, a move expected to cut about 25,000 metric tons of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for ocean freight shipped through DHL’s GoGreen Plus and CMA CGM’s ACT+ programs. The estimated cuts accounts for emissions across the fuel’s entire lifecycle—from production to consumption.

The two companies will use the biofuel UCOME, which stands for used cooking oil methyl ester, as an alternative to traditional fuels. The second-generation biofuel is produced by recycling used cooking oil, instead of growing new crops for fuel.

The joint decarbonization initiative is aimed at helping both companies reach their net-zero GHG emissions targets by 2050.

This initiative is expected to have a trickle-down effect for the European carriers’ customers, enabling them to cut the carbon footprint of their international supply chains.

DHL’s GoGreen Plus service enables customers to select sustainable marine fuel options for their transport, which the company says make room for reductions of up to 80 percent GHG emissions compared to conventional maritime fuel.

“This collaboration marks another milestone in our mission towards low-carbon supply chains,” said Casper Ellerbaek, head of global ocean freight at DHL Global Forwarding, in a statement. “By leveraging sustainable marine fuels, we help our customers achieve their climate goals and drive real progress toward decarbonization.”

CMA CGM’s ACT+ program similarly gives shippers a chance to cut emissions by paying a premium price. The program enables customers to reduce the carbon footprint of their shipments by 10 percent to as much as 83 percent, using low-carbon fuels such as waste-derived biofuels.

As part of the partnership, the French ocean carrier said it would physically bunker the biofuel across its fleet, ensuring that emission reductions correspond to DHL’s “book and claim” approach.

Under book and claim, the buyer books a specific quantity of sustainable fuel at the time of purchase and then claims the emissions reduction toward their sustainability targets. As a result, the buyer owns the environmental benefits without physically possessing the fuel.

“Our partnership with DHL demonstrates how collaboration can accelerate the shift to low-carbon shipping,” said Olivier Nivoix, executive vice president of shipping at CMA CGM Group, in a statement.

According to Nivoix, CMA CGM has cut the carbon intensity of its shipping activities by 57 percent since 2008 due to its heavy investments in alternative fuels and dual-fuel vessels. By 2029, CMA CGM expects its dual-fuel fleet to reach 162 vessels, including 24 powered by methanol.

With the partnership in place, both companies say they will explore more opportunities to scale up lower-carbon fuel usage and develop additional collaborative approaches to decarbonize international supply chains.

CMA CGM has started similar partnerships with shippers in recent years, including a year-long deal with Nike to help the athleticwear giant decarbonize its ocean freight. Through May 2024, Nike transported 36 percent of volume shipped via CMA CGM on one of their vessels using sustainable biofuel. Through the year, Nike reduced their CO2 emissions by 25,000 tons.

The container shipping company has also partnered with Fruit of the Loom, helping the underwear brand cut CO2 emissions by nearly 3,000 tons from January 2023 to March 2024.

In the evolving landscape of maritime decarbonization, few subjects are as timely or arguably as misunderstood as wind-assisted propulsion. Yet the shipping industry finds itself at a decisive moment, driven by regulatory tightening, customer expectations for greener supply chains, and an urgent need to manage escalating fuel costs. Wind-assisted propulsion systems (WAPS), and wingsails in particular, are no longer speculative technologies. They are proven, available, and scalable solutions ready to meet the moment, writes Dr. Lee Kindberg, previously Head of Environment and Sustainability for AP Moller-Maersk (Maersk) in North America, and now a board member at WAPS manufacturer, OceanWings.

Most global shipping companies have long-term multi-faceted strategies to reduce both carbon footprint and other environmental impacts, and for example, container vessels have made significant improvements in efficiency (transport work) since 2005. Their tactics have evolved over the 20+ years since customers initially approached container shipping companies to find ways to measure, report and reduce the carbon footprint of their shipments. In this sector, much of the ""low hanging fruit"" has already been harvested. This includes larger vessels, a variety of energy efficiency retrofits and technologies, and operational changes like slow steaming.

In the last few years shipping companies have built vessels designed from the beginning to operate on cleaner fuels like LNG and methanol at high efficiency and low carbon footprint. They have implemented IT approaches to optimize routing, speeds, drafts and other criteria. Now with IMO’s new performance criteria and reporting, and with the EU’s FuelEU Maritime and Emissions Trading System, more sophisticated engine modifications and data systems are in the works, as are new low carbon fuels and operational measures like just-in-time arrival and shore power.

Reduce Fuel & Carbon

Technologies and operational approaches that reduce fuel consumption also reduce environmental impacts. This is especially true for decarbonization, since fuel savings and low carbon fuels translate directly into reduced greenhouse gases. Wind-assisted propulsion systems reduce the fuel required for voyages and can be retrofitted to existing vessels or installed on new builds. WAPS have the potential for some of the largest savings available to ship owners and operators.

Current and emerging regulations, regional fuel taxes, and carbon prices increase fuel costs for shipowners and operators. New technologies like wingsails are delivering significant fuel savings: as much as 35% in recent real-world fuel studies with OceanWings. As vessels adopt more costly low carbon fuels, achieving fuel savings becomes even more important. The more expensive the fuel, the more money the ship owner can save, and the faster the investment payback. The Canopée vessel’s two-year operational results demonstrated consistent fuel savings of up to 2.2 tonnes per day per wingsail, and 99% wingsail uptime. These are not theoretical models but validated data from daily commercial use, establishing wind propulsion as one of the most effective tools available today.

Any addition of a major new technology requires a change in thinking, in planning and in operational execution. Vessel performance with wingsails can be enhanced with better understanding and use of wind patterns, waves, draft and routing. New training is needed for mariners, shore personnel and Coast Guard. New or modified data systems will also be needed, and experience sharing will become essential as more vessels adopt technologies like wind-assisted propulsion systems.

Demo Tech to Fast Track Adoption

Establishing credibility is a very important factor in the early days of a technology’s introduction. One powerful way that ports, governments and other entities can encourage adoption of new technologies is by establishing technology demonstration programs. A structured technology demonstration program can accelerate adoption by bringing together stakeholders, vessel operators and technology providers, and assisting them in finding financing, technical support and interpretation and communications of the results.

Incentives programs such as those based on the Environmental Ship Index (ESI) and other regional and port programs can also be very impactful. These incentives may include small or larger monetary incentives, recognition of innovation and results, technology demonstration support grants, or ways to assemble collaborative groups to spread both risk and knowledge in early development phases. The new ESI 2.0 is expected to recognize innovative technologies, and new IMO regulations are structured to reward those who innovate or simply use less fuel.

Early movers do need additional support and flexibility. For later stages programs can become more standardized or integrated into regular incentive structures to encourage those second and third movers. In some cases, it actually takes regulation to get the more conservative stakeholders to take action. Any new technology also brings new challenges in safety standards, risk management and insurance. A process to put all these together promptly can facilitate implementation and avoid delays or unplanned costs. Again, this is particularly important at the first mover stage.

Class Developments

Classification societies are instrumental in bridging the gap between innovation and commercial deployment, and it's encouraging to see many WAPS companies making steady progress through constructive engagement with these bodies. Without formal recognition from class, even the most promising technologies can stall. That is why the recent Type Approval Design Certificate (TADC) awarded to OceanWings by DNV represents a key milestone for the WAPS sector.

This certification confirms that the design of the rigid OceanWings system, in both its tiltable and fixed configurations, meets DNV’s rigorous technical and regulatory standards for safety, reliability, and operation. It provides shipowners, yards, and flag states with a streamlined path to implementation. It removes ambiguity, simplifies documentation, and de-risks decision-making for those looking to integrate wind power into their fleets.",https://images.marinelink.com/images/maritime/w800/copyright-jifmar-166678.jpg,N,,2025-12-29 10:57:35.803480

This approach combines the IMO protocol of Resolution MEPC.402(83) for methane slip measurements with an interim procedure for engine load monitoring until international standards are established and integrated into the EU framework. Operators may also apply the same interim solution under EU MRV/ETS.

Why verified methane slip matters

Methane slip from internal combustion engines increases the vessel’s overall CO2-equivalent (CO2eq) emissions. Given that according to the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) methane has 25 times the global warming potential (GWP) of CO2, methane slip emissions significantly impact a vessel’s greenhouse gas (GHG) footprint. Slip levels depend heavily on the engine’s load, with lower loads generally resulting in higher slip.

High methane slip can erode the GHG advantage of LNG compared to conventional liquid fuels. Engine designers and manufacturers work on reducing methane slip through advanced combustion technologies and after-treatment solutions. However, default methane slip factors (Cslip) used under FEUM are based solely on engine type and may not reflect the improvements achieved through upgrades or optimization.

As FEUM thresholds tighten over the next decade, verified actual methane slip factors can significantly lower penalty exposure and generate compliance surplus. For example, applying actual methane slip emission factors to a 90,000 DWT LNG carrier—with a dual-fuel diesel-electric propulsion system using Otto-cycle medium-speed engines and an emission abatement system achieving a 50% methane slip reduction—could generate over EUR 500,000 annually through pooling arrangements.

Measurement protocol: Test bed and onboard (IMO MEPC.402(83))

Methane slip measurements and calculations—conducted on a test-bed or onboard—must follow IMO Resolution MEPC.402(83) and include the 10% mode point or the lowest mode point at which gas fuel would be used.

Onboard measurements following protocol set out in MEPC.402(83):

Acceptable for an Individual Engine or for an Engine Group represented by the Parent Engine.

Not acceptable for an Engine Family without further justification.

Test-bed measurements following protocol set out in MEPC.402(83):

May be accepted for an Engine Family.

Use of THC as a proxy for methane:

If direct methane measurement is not performed, measurements of total hydrocarbons (THC) performed according to MEPC.402(83) or the NOx Technical Code 2008 (NTC as amended) may be used as a proxy. In that case, the THC measurements should include a 10% mode point or the lowest mode point at which gas fuel would be used.",https://safety4sea.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/shutterstock_1972988039.jpg,N,,2025-12-29 05:56:54.098753

Lines (MOL) has signed a memorandum of understanding with China’s largest fuel supplier Sinopec and Japanese trading company Marubeni to set up a long-term supply system for biodiesel fuel used in ships, reports Container News.

Under the agreement, the three companies will work together to ensure a steady and reliable supply of biodiesel in China. MOL will encourage the use of biodiesel in shipping, while Sinopec and Marubeni will help develop storage facilities, transport systems and fuel supply ports.

The move comes as the shipping industry faces stricter environmental rules and increasing pressure to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Biodiesel is seen as an effective alternative to conventional marine fuels, as it can be used in existing ship engines without any changes. It also helps cut carbon emissions over its full life cycle compared with traditional heavy fuel oil.

MOL said demand for biodiesel is expected to rise in the coming years and pointed to China’s importance as a major supplier of raw materials used to make biodiesel. The company said the agreement would help create an early and stable fuel supply system in partnership with Sinopec and Marubeni.

By establishing a stable maritime transport route for low-carbon ammonia, MOL and JERA aim to support the early formation of a full-scale ammonia value chain that links production, international transport, and end use in power generation.
When used as a fuel, ammonia does not emit carbon dioxide during combustion, making it an attractive option for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
As countries and industries intensify efforts to reduce emissions, demand for low-carbon ammonia is expected to grow substantially across multiple sectors.
Ammonia transport requires advanced vessel design, strict safety standards, and highly trained crews—areas in which MOL already has extensive experience.","Mitsui O.S.K. Lines, Ltd. (MOL) has announced that it has entered into two Heads of Agreements with JERA Co., Inc. for the time charter of two very large gas carriers (VLGCs) specifically designed to transport ammonia. These agreements represent an important step toward the realization of Japan’s first commercial-scale, low-carbon ammonia transportation project. Under the proposed arrangements, the vessels will carry low-carbon ammonia produced at the Blue Point Complex in Louisiana, United States—an industrial facility in which JERA has invested—to JERA’s Hekinan Thermal Power Station, located in Hekinan City, Aichi Prefecture.

This initiative marks a significant milestone for Japan’s energy transition. By establishing a stable maritime transport route for low-carbon ammonia, MOL and JERA aim to support the early formation of a full-scale ammonia value chain that links production, international transport, and end use in power generation. Discussions between the two companies on cooperation in fuel ammonia transportation have been ongoing since November 2022, and the newly signed Heads of Agreements build on these earlier dialogues. The intent is to move beyond feasibility studies and toward a commercially viable supply chain capable of supporting Japan’s decarbonization ambitions.

Ammonia has traditionally been used as a key raw material in the manufacture of fertilizers and a wide range of chemical products. In recent years, however, it has gained increasing attention as a next-generation clean energy carrier. When used as a fuel, ammonia does not emit carbon dioxide during combustion, making it an attractive option for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In addition to its potential role as a fuel for thermal power plants and marine vessels, ammonia is also viewed as an efficient carrier for hydrogen, further enhancing its strategic importance in a low-carbon energy system. As countries and industries intensify efforts to reduce emissions, demand for low-carbon ammonia is expected to grow substantially across multiple sectors.

Within this context, MOL has positioned environmental and sustainability initiatives as a central pillar of its long-term management strategy. Under its management plan, “BLUE ACTION 2035,” the MOL Group has committed to addressing environmental challenges while maintaining competitiveness in global shipping and logistics. Furthermore, through its “MOL Group Environmental Vision 2.2,” the company has set a clear objective of achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Developing and operating a robust ammonia value chain is seen as a key pathway toward achieving this goal.

By actively participating in large-scale ammonia transport projects, MOL seeks not only to support emerging demand for ammonia as a fuel, but also to strengthen its expertise in the safe and reliable handling of this substance. Ammonia transport requires advanced vessel design, strict safety standards, and highly trained crews—areas in which MOL already has extensive experience. The company plans to leverage this know-how to ensure stable, secure, and efficient maritime transport solutions as global demand for low-carbon fuels increases.

Drawing on its position as one of the world’s largest shipping companies, MOL will continue to expand its portfolio of social infrastructure businesses, technologies, and services centered on marine transportation.

This Guide offers a strategic and practical framework for shipping companies to transition to net-zero emissions.","The maritime industry is at the beginning of a major trans- formation. Driven by a continuously evolving regulatory environment, intensifying commercial pressure, and a gen- eral global shift towards reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the transition to net zero is taking shape.

In this context, the Net-Zero Guide (the Guide) provides a structured, practical framework to support shipowners, operators, and managers in developing cost-effective com- pliance strategies while maintaining long-term resilience. The Guide focuses on actionable measures to align fleet operations, investments, and value-chain partnerships with evolving regulatory and market expectations.

The International Maritime Organization (IMO) and regional bodies such as the European Union (EU) have introduced ambitious decarbonization targets, including net-zero emissions by 2050. This is being underpinned by regulatory frameworks, which are reshaping the industry’s strategic pri- orities. This is currently most prominent in the EU, where the Emissions Trading System (ETS) was extended to shipping in 2024, and the FuelEU Maritime regulation implemented in 2025, promoting the use of low-GHG fuels.

The IMO is attempting to introduce similar legislation on a global scale through the Net-Zero Framework (NZF). While this was approved by members in April 2025, an extraordi- nary session of the IMO’s MEPC in October 2025 decided to delay its adoption by adjourning the meeting for one year. As a result, the earliest potential entry into force is now 1 March 2028.

Maritime decarbonization is being propelled by other influential forces, including pressure from financial institu- tions, expectations from cargo owners, and the growing importance of corporate ESG commitments. While these forces work in different ways, they all make environmental performance a critical determinant for securing access to capital, maintaining competitiveness, and ensuring long- term commercial viability.

Given the ongoing fragmentation and rapid evolution of regulatory and commercial frameworks, compliance require- ments are becoming increasingly complex and costly. This

is particularly challenging for small and medium-sized en- terprises (SMEs), which must navigate overlapping require- ments across jurisdictions and develop holistic strategies that integrate technology adaptation, value-chain transfor- mation, and responsiveness to shifting market dynamics.

As these demands intensify, shipping companies must shift from reactive compliance to proactive transformation. This means developing strategies where regulatory alignment, strategic innovation, and operational performance advance in parallel.

A phased approach to fleet decarbonization is essen- tial, and shipping companies should develop a strategic approach across short-, medium-, and long-term horizons. The Guide recommends a three-step framework to help shipping companies translate decarbonization objectives into executable actions across their fleets:

1.Assessment

•Conduct a detailed evaluation of the fleet’s current emissions profile, benchmarking vessel performance against applicable decarbonization frameworks.

•Identify exposure to regulatory requirements across short-, medium-, and long-term time horizons.

•Determine technical and operational gaps, assessing where efficiency upgrades, fuel transitions, or process improvements are required.

2.Strategic planning

•Develop a fleet-wide decarbonization roadmap that integrates operational measures and technical upgrades within a unified planning horizon.

•Prioritize operational measures such as speed optimization, weather routing, and trim and ballast management to deliver near-term efficiency gains.

•Plan technical upgrades – including energy-saving devices, hull coatings, engine retrofits, and alternative-fuel readiness – through a structured cost-benefit assessment.

•Align fleet renewal and retrofit plans with technology readiness, shipyard availability, and regulatory milestones to avoid stranded assets.

3.Implementation and monitoring

•Execute identified measures through a phased programme supported by clear timelines, key performance indicators, and governance structures.

•Employ digital tools and fleet performance monitoring systems to track fuel consumption, emissions, and compliance status in real time.

•Institutionalize a continuous feedback process to refine strategies as regulations and technologies evolve.

The assessment stage establishes a factual baseline and en- ables companies to prioritize resources effectively, ensuring regulatory compliance and informed decisions. Translating this to a robust strategic plan positions companies to meet compliance milestones while preserving commercial flexi- bility and investment efficiency. Once these strategies are executed, embedding data-driven monitoring and adaptive governance enables shipping companies to maintain align- ment with dynamic regulatory environments while building internal capability and resilience.

But decarbonization extends beyond technology, and organizational transformation across the value chain is equally important for the implementation of new technolo- gies and systems.

To manage this transition in an optimal way, maintain safety, and ensure readiness for emerging regulatory frameworks, a structural approach incorporating effective change man- agement and capacity building is key, allowing companies to balance short-term operational efficiency with long-term decarbonization readiness. Marrying this with an effective operational strategy ensures compliance, enhances prof- itability, and prepares companies for future low- and zero- carbon operations.

The Guide proposes an organizational roadmap, in three key domains, which can incorporate all of these elements, ensuring long-term compliance and competitiveness:

1.Fleet renewal and retrofit strategy

•Pursue a dual-pathway approach that combines newbuild programmes incorporating zero- and near-zero (ZNZ) fuel systems with targeted retrofits to extend the operational life of existing assets.

•Engage early with shipyards, designers, and technology suppliers to ensure vessel designs are fuel-ready, accommodating methanol, ammonia or hydrogen systems as infrastructure matures.

•Implement retrofitting programmes to upgrade propulsion systems, install energy-saving devices, and integrate digital monitoring capabilities.

•Coordinate fleet renewal with regulatory checkpoints (2030–2040–2050) and evolving market signals to optimize capital deployment and minimize stranded- asset risk.

2.Fleet operational strategy to net zero

•Optimize vessel operations across the fleet through data- driven voyage planning, fuel management, and emissions monitoring.

•Deploy operational optimization techniques – such as slow steaming, weather routing, port call optimization, and trim and draft optimization – to deliver measurable efficiency gains.

•Adopt phased fuel transition strategies, beginning with drop-in biofuels and progressing to ZNZ fuels such

as green methanol, ammonia, or hydrogen, based on infrastructure readiness.

•Leverage digital platforms for real-time performance tracking and integration of environmental metrics into commercial decisions.

3.Manage change to overcome implementation challenges

•Apply structured Management of Change (MoC) frameworks to address the organizational, technical, and safety implications of adopting new fuels and technologies.

•Strengthen cross-departmental coordination between technical, commercial, and operational teams to ensure consistent implementation of decarbonization measures.

•Invest in crew and shore-based competence development, particularly in fuel handling, safety, and digital systems operation.

•Embed digitalization and cybersecurity as core enablers of compliance, ensuring data integrity and transparency across reporting and performance systems.

To complement internal efforts, external facing practices are equally essential. This should include alignment with external stakeholders across regulatory bodies, commercial partners, and the broader value chain, helping stakeholders to scale decarbonization efforts and unlock commercial value.

Shipping executives should focus on the following strategic priorities, integrating technical, operational, and commer- cial perspectives:

•Embed decarbonization into core business strategy, linking compliance objectives with fleet investment, financing, and chartering models.

•Adopt a lifecycle perspective on fleet management, balancing renewal, retrofit, and operational optimization within a unified investment framework.

•Leverage partnerships across the value chain – including fuel suppliers, ports, financiers, and technology providers – to accelerate innovation and manage risk.

•Invest in digitalization and data governance to enhance performance transparency, ensure regulatory compliance, and unlock long-term operational efficiency.

•Build organizational capability through structured competence development and robust change management processes that support sustainable growth.

With the regulatory and market environment evolving rapidly, shipping companies must adopt a dynamic, iterative approach to strategic planning. Advances in fuels, propul- sion systems, energy-efficiency technologies, and digitalization continue to unlock new opportunities for emissions

reduction and operational performance. To stay aligned with shifting conditions, structured review cycles, supported by robust data frameworks and performance indicators, are essential for validating strategy effectiveness. Ongoing engagement in policy development and industry forums will help ensure companies remain responsive to future regulatory thresholds and market expectations.

Strategic navigation toward net zero

The decarbonization of global shipping is both a regulatory necessity and a strategic opportunity. Companies that act early – combining robust compliance frameworks with innovation, operational excellence, and collaborative value-chain engagement – will not only meet emerging net-zero requirements but also secure long-term competitiveness in a rapidly transforming maritime economy.

This Guide offers a strategic and practical framework for shipping companies to transition to net-zero emissions. By integrating internal best practices with external part- nerships and continuous review, companies can build resilience, unlock commercial opportunities, and lead the maritime sector’s green transformation.

The journey to net zero will be more than a regulatory obligation – it is a strategic opportunity to redefine maritime operations for a sustainable future.",,N,,2025-12-28 17:57:06.430603

The ship, Höegh Australis, is powered almost entirely by liquefied natural gas, making it the first LNG-fuelled vessel ever to dock at an East African port. Its arrival marked a technical milestone for Kenya Ports Authority and a symbolic moment for a region whose trade arteries have long depended on some of the world’s most carbon-intensive fuels.

The Höegh Australis is a roll-on, roll-off vehicle carrier measuring 200 meters in length and nearly 38 metres across, with space for more than 9,300 vehicles spread over 16 decks. On this call, it discharged 824 vehicles and accessories destined for Kenya and neighboring landlocked markets that rely on Mombasa as their primary maritime gateway, including Uganda, Rwanda, South Sudan and parts of eastern Democratic Republic of Congo.

The scale of the vessel alone would be notable in any port. That it arrived running on 98 per cent LNG, using conventional bunker fuel only during engine start-up and limited manoeuvres, is what set this visit apart.

LNG-powered ships require different handling protocols, specialized safety procedures and crews familiar with advanced navigation and propulsion systems. The successful berthing demonstrated that Mombasa can meet these demands, an important signal to global shipping lines assessing which African ports are ready for the next phase of maritime transport.

International shipping is under pressure to change; The sector accounts for roughly three per cent of global carbon dioxide emissions, according to the International Maritime Organisation, and new IMO regulations require deep cuts in sulphur oxides, nitrogen oxides and particulate matter. Heavy fuel oil, the industry’s traditional mainstay, is among the dirtiest fuels in commercial use.

LNG does not eliminate emissions, but it reduces sulphur oxides and particulate matter almost entirely, cuts nitrogen oxides by up to 85 per cent and lowers carbon dioxide emissions by roughly 20 per cent compared to conventional marine fuels. For port cities such as Mombasa, Lagos and Durban, where shipping emissions mix with urban pollution, these reductions translate directly into cleaner air.

Globally, more than 1,200 LNG-capable vessels are now in operation or on order, a number that has more than doubled over the past five years. African ports, however, have lagged in accommodating them. South Africa’s Durban and Ngqura ports have invested in shore-side efficiency and cleaner equipment but have yet to see regular LNG vessel calls.

In West Africa, Nigeria has explored LNG bunkering given its gas reserves, yet infrastructure development has been slow. North African ports such as Tangier Med have moved faster on efficiency and automation, but LNG adoption remains limited. Against this backdrop, Mombasa’s ability to receive Höegh Australis places it among a small group of African ports demonstrating readiness for lower-emission shipping.

The ship itself reflects how the industry is hedging its future. Built just a year ago, Höegh Australis is designed to be ammonia-ready, meaning it can be converted to run on zero-carbon fuels once safety standards, supply chains and port infrastructure catch up.

Ammonia-fuelled vessels have begun limited service in parts of Asia and Europe, but costs remain high and global bunkering networks are fragmented. For now, LNG serves as a bridge fuel, allowing shipping companies to meet tightening regulations while buying time for truly carbon-free options to mature.

For Kenya, the implications extend beyond environmental credentials. The Port of Mombasa handles more than 30 million tonnes of cargo annually and supports trade flows worth billions of dollars across East and Central Africa. Shipping efficiency affects everything from vehicle prices in Kampala to food costs in Kigali.

LNG-powered vessels are typically newer, larger and more fuel-efficient, enabling carriers to move more cargo per voyage at lower operating costs. Over time, this can translate into more competitive freight rates and more reliable services for African importers and exporters.

Kenya Ports Authority has framed the call within its Green Port Policy, which aligns with national clean energy objectives and Kenya’s broader climate commitments. In recent years, KPA has invested in electric rubber-tyred gantry cranes, energy-efficient lighting and digital traffic management to reduce congestion and emissions within the port.

According to KPA data, operational efficiency improvements have already cut vessel waiting times by more than 30 per cent over the past decade, reducing fuel burn at anchorage. Accommodating LNG vessels builds on these gains, shifting part of the emissions reduction upstream to the ships themselves.

Across Africa, ports are grappling with how to modernise under fiscal constraints while trade volumes continue to grow. The African Development Bank estimates that the continent needs more than $100 billion in port and logistics investment over the next decade to keep pace with demand. Sustainability is no longer a side consideration in that calculus.

European and Asian markets are beginning to factor shipping emissions into procurement decisions, and cargo owners are under pressure to decarbonise their supply chains. Ports that cannot service cleaner vessels risk being bypassed.

The arrival of Höegh Australis does not resolve these challenges, nor does it place Mombasa at the forefront of zero-carbon shipping. What it does show is that parts of Africa’s maritime system are beginning to adapt in step with global change rather than after it.

As LNG vessels become more common and alternative fuels edge closer to viability, the question for African ports will be how quickly isolated milestones become routine practice. On a quiet December morning in Mombasa, that transition moved from theory to steel, fuel lines and a ship safely alongside the quay.",https://africasustainabilitymatters.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-27-122541.jpg,N,,2025-12-28 18:56:27.366143

The research draws on contributions from national institutions such as the Agence Nationale des Ports, Tanger Med Special Agency, the Moroccan Agency for Sustainable Energy (Masen), and the Research Institute for Solar Energy and New Energies (IRESEN), alongside international partners including PROBLUE and the Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility. Together, these actors explore how Morocco’s ports can evolve from traditional trade gateways into engines of a new clean-energy economy.

Why Shipping and Hydrogen Are Changing Everything

International shipping is under growing pressure to cut emissions. Responsible for nearly three percent of global greenhouse gases, the sector is now subject to firm climate rules set by the International Maritime Organization, which aims for net-zero emissions by or around 2050. In parallel, the European Union has extended its carbon market to shipping and introduced fuel rules that favor low-carbon alternatives. These policies are expected to make fossil fuels steadily more expensive while pushing shipowners toward new fuels. Green hydrogen, converted into ammonia or methanol, is widely seen as one of the few viable options to decarbonize long-distance shipping, as well as other hard-to-abate sectors such as fertilizers, steel, and aviation.

Morocco’s Natural Advantage in Green Hydrogen

The report argues that Morocco is exceptionally well placed to benefit from this shift. Its strong solar and wind resources allow it to produce renewable electricity at very low cost, which is the main driver of green hydrogen prices. Morocco is also close to Europe, which is expected to become the world’s largest importer of green hydrogen, and it has a long coastline with multiple ports open to global trade. These factors together give Morocco a structural advantage over many competitors. However, the study stresses that cheap production alone is not enough. The success of green hydrogen depends on the full value chain, including storage, transport, port handling, and reliable demand from ships and industry.

Four Ports, Four Different Strengths

To understand how this value chain could work in practice, the report assesses four port locations. Tanger Med, at the Strait of Gibraltar, stands out as Morocco’s main bunkering hub. Its position on major shipping routes means it can supply green fuels not only to ships calling at the port, but also to vessels passing through the Mediterranean and Atlantic corridors. However, limited space makes large-scale hydrogen production there difficult. Mohammedia, near Casablanca, has a different advantage: nearby salt caverns that could be used for low-cost hydrogen storage, helping stabilize supply across the system. Jorf Lasfar, Morocco’s largest industrial port, already handles large volumes of ammonia and is closely linked to fertilizer and steel production, making it ideal for domestic hydrogen use. Tan-Tan, in southern Morocco, emerges as the most promising production site thanks to excellent renewable resources and available land, even though it would require major new investments and skills development.

A Connected System and the Role of Policy

Rather than developing each port in isolation, the report proposes an integrated “Lighthouse Scenario.” In this vision, green hydrogen would be produced at scale near Tan-Tan, transported by pipeline to Mohammedia for storage, distributed to Jorf Lasfar for industry, and supplied to Tanger Med for ship bunkering and exports. This coordinated approach could significantly reduce costs compared to fragmented development. Still, green fuels remain much more expensive than fossil fuels today. Closing this gap will require strong policy support, including international carbon pricing, clear national safety rules, shared infrastructure, concessional finance, and early pilot projects such as a green bunkering trial at Tanger Med.

Gateway to Green Energy presents Morocco’s ports as more than logistical assets. With the right coordination and regulation, they could become strategic hubs linking renewable energy, global trade, and industrial transformation, allowing Morocco to turn climate action into long-term economic opportunity.",https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/devnews/24_12_2025_10_03_33_5222196.png?width=920&format=jpeg,N,,2025-12-28 00:12:09.950381
