Dubai-based bunker trading firm Flex Commodities (Flex) is entering the middle of its second year of operations. Singapore bunkering publication Manifold Times checks with Maaz Ahmed, Trading Director at Flex, to find out more:

MT: Flex Commodities is entering the middle of its second year of operations; how has the company grown since its establishment in June 2024?

Over the past year, Flex Commodities has grown much faster than expected. We began in Q3 2024 with just three people, and as the business gained momentum, we built up our capabilities across trading, operations, finance, HR, and compliance. Today, we’re a 22-member team, with our headquarters in Dubai and support teams across multiple time zones.

Geographically, we expanded from being a single-office setup in Dubai to establishing operational presence in Greece, Singapore, and Brazil, giving us coverage across Europe, Asia, and South America.

Flex aims to be present at the heart of market action and a first step in that direction was to establish a Singapore entity – Flex Commodities PTE LTD. We have so far hired three senior professionals for the team who bring extensive experience across different facets of the value chain:

Wilson Tang (Regional Manager, Singapore) With a long track record in Asia’s marine fuels market, Wilson brings strong commercial judgement and regional trading insight that elevates FLEX’s strategic positioning in Singapore.

Tan Ying – Lead Trader, China (Singapore Desk) With more than 15 years of experience in marine fuels trading and business development across China and Singapore, Tan Ying enhances FLEX’s regional trading capabilities and commercial reach.

John Teng – (Senior Supply Trader) John brings deep expertise in regional supply markets, leveraging his understanding of trading economics and supplier networks to strengthen FLEX’s commercial edge across Asia.

MT: As a relatively new bunker and cargo trading startup, what was the biggest challenge Flex faced in gaining a foothold in this competitive marketplace during its first year? How has Flex managed to overcome this challenge?

One of the biggest challenges for us in the first year was credibility. In bunker and cargo trading, the market is extremely relationship-driven suppliers need to trust that you will perform, and customers need to know you can deliver consistently. Even though the team had years of experience, Flex as a company was still new, so we had to prove ourselves from day one.

We tackled this challenge by relying on the relationships and reputation our team members already had in the industry. That helped us gain early support from key suppliers and customers. The backing and PCG support from our parent company also played a major role, giving counterparties the confidence to trade with us at scale while we built our own credit history.

Another challenge was managing market exposure and volatility while scaling up. As our volumes increased, price risk became a bigger factor. To handle this, we set up a derivatives desk for internal hedging and risk management. This gave us better control over our exposure, improved our ability to take positions responsibly, and strengthened our internal risk framework.

At the same time, we expanded our operations, finance, and compliance teams to ensure the company could support the commercial growth sustainably.

By combining strong relationships, reliable performance, PCG support, and disciplined internal risk management, we were able to establish credibility quickly and build a solid foothold in a very competitive market within our first year.

MT: For counterparties, what are the advantages of working together with FLEX? Can you share some examples?

One of the biggest advantages for counterparties working with Flex is the speed and clarity we bring to every deal. Because our structure is lean and our decision-making is centralised, customers and suppliers get quick answers whether it’s pricing, credit approval, operations, or payments. That agility makes a huge difference, especially in time-sensitive bunker markets.

Another strength is our reliability. We take on trades we know we can perform, and once we commit, we execute cleanly. For suppliers, that means timely payments and smooth coordination with barges and agents. For customers, it means fewer operational issues and clear communication throughout the delivery.

We also add value through information. Our research team sends out daily market reports, giving our counterparties insights on price movements. It’s an additional service that many clients appreciate because it helps them make more informed decisions, not just spot purchases.

Our growing geographical presence with Dubai as our HQ and additional coverage in Greece, Singapore, and Brazil lets us support enquiries across multiple time zones and stay closer to both suppliers and end users.

Finally, counterparties take comfort in our financial backing. The support from our parent company, including PCG when required, gives suppliers confidence to extend credit and allows us to scale responsibly.

MT: Considering current global events and market volatility, what are the current risks and pitfalls of bunker trading firms, and how is Flex managing or even taking advantage of these exposures?

The biggest risks for bunker traders right now are price volatility, counterparty risk, and operational/compliance issues.

Volatility can easily eat into margins if exposure isn’t managed properly.

Counterparty risk is one of the major pitfalls, especially with uncertain markets and extended payment terms. At Flex, we run a strict Know Your Customer (KYC) and credit process which helps us avoid taking unnecessary exposure.

Operational and compliance risk is also high, given sanctions changes and port-specific restrictions. We have invested early in strong operations and compliance teams to ensure clean execution and avoid mistakes that can be costly.

These controls give us an advantage because while some traders pull back during volatile periods, we can take on opportunities confidently, knowing our exposure is disciplined and well-managed.

MT: Moving forward, it is clear the shipping industry is adopting green bunker fuels due to IMO 2030/2050. What are the plans Flex has undertaken to future proof itself?

We know the industry is moving toward greener bunker fuels, and our plan is to prepare for that transition gradually and realistically. Flex is already in the process of obtaining ISCC certification, which is the first step toward being able to handle sustainable fuels with proper documentation and traceability.

Beyond that, our approach is to stay informed. Our research team monitors developments in biofuels, methanol, LNG, and other alternative fuels, and we’re keeping an eye on how different ports and suppliers are progressing.

As the market becomes more mature and customer demand increases, we’ll be in a position to integrate these products into our offering. So for now, our focus is on certification, building internal understanding, and making sure we’re ready to move when the market is ready.

Julie Nielsen argued relying on manual Excel sheets for bunkering operations is no longer adequate for maintaining the necessary control in this evolving landscape. As such, digital solutions are vital for dismantling internal company silos, thereby enabling more effective data-driven decisions.

Nielsen was participating in the AI and the Future of Digitalisation: Transforming the Bunker Value Chain panel discussion at IBIA Annual Convention 2025 in Hong Kong on Wednesday (19 November) when she noted a primary impediment to widespread adoption of digital solutions to be human resistance.

“This is often rooted in a ‘psychological barrier’ where individuals perceive data sharing as a risk,” she explained.

“This resistance frequently stems from users’ insecurity that data might expose past inefficiencies in their job performance.

“Despite C-level executives increasingly recognising bunkers as a boardroom topic, driven by Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) reporting and banking requirements, user-level adoption remains a challenge.”

Nielsen stressed AI-driven transparency is paramount for the shipping and bunkering industry, necessitating openness with data from both marine fuel buyers and suppliers.

She also highlighted the pivotal role of verifiers in driving behaviour by ensuring data correctness and identifying inconsistencies.

While acknowledging the inherent complexity of the bunkering supply chain, Julie firmly stated there is no viable alternative to digitalisation for maintaining competitiveness.

She further challenged the notion that digitalisation diminishes the “human touch”, contending that digital systems can offer more valuable data than traditional communication methods like WhatsApp.

“A funny argument we also hear out there is, ‘oh we don’t want to go digital because it takes away the human touch’. How much human touch do you actually have on WhatsApp?” She questioned.

“You send a text message [on WhatsApp] and you get a reply.

“What difference does it make when you do it in a system which can actually help create all the data and give you the valued data proposition for future decisions.”

The Global Centre for Maritime Decarbonisation (GCMD), AIM Horizon Investments and their partners on Thursday (20 November) announced the successful closing of the Fund for Energy Efficiency Technologies (FEET), securing total commitments of up to USD 35M, exceeding its initial target.

As the world’s first fund for vessel retrofits leveraging a pay-as-you-save repayment mechanism, FEET directly addresses the long-standing financial barriers hindering the sector’s uptake of vessel retrofits.

This fund has drawn strong interest from across the maritime value chain, including equipment manufacturers, shipowners, and investors. GCMD provides catalytic equity and is FEET’s appointed decarbonisation advisor.

FEET is managed by AIM Horizon Investments. Formerly known as FPG AIM Capital, AIM Horizon Investments is a Singapore-based fund manager specialising in maritime and aviation funds for institutional and accredited investors.

Shareholders of AIM Horizon Investments hold the fund’s commercial equity position, while the Development Bank of Japan Inc. (DBJ) holds the preferred equity position. DBS Bank and ING (which acted as Coordinating Bank) have in principle agreed to provide senior debt financing.

Improving energy efficiency remains one of the most effective strategies to reduce emissions and fuel costs. Energy Efficiency Technologies (EETs), such as wind-assisted propulsion systems (WAPS) and air lubrication systems (ALS), can deliver immediate fuel savings, assisting shipowners to stay competitive amid tightening regional carbon regulations. However, even with a retrofit market valued at over USD 20B, uncertainties around EET performance and access to financing continue to limit uptake.

A primary difficulty restricting adoption is the inherently variable fuel savings from EET retrofits, which depend on operational and environmental factors, such as routing and weather conditions. The lack of standardised methodologies to accurately measure fuel savings further challenges uptake.

This uncertainty has made the return on investment period difficult to predict and has exacerbated the split-incentive issue, where shipowners are expected to invest in retrofits whereas charterers realise savings.

A pay-as-you-save repayment mechanism addresses payback uncertainty with EETs by directly linking repayment to quantified and verified fuel and regulatory savings. Deploying this mechanism requires robust data collection and analysis to isolate the retrofit’s contribution to overall fuel savings.

To this end, GCMD has undertaken EET performance pilots, equipping vessels with additional sensors to acquire high-precision, high-resolution data and applying rigorous data analytics to quantify fuel savings with statistical confidence. As more data is collected across diverse operating and environmental conditions, these datasets can be used to model and predict savings under varying scenarios.

FEET is designed to scale beyond this initial closing, recognising the vast market size and shipping sector’s pressing decarbonisation needs. GCMD and AIM Horizon Investments are targeting to scale the fund to USD 500 million by 2030, capable of supporting around 200 ships.

Professor Lynn Loo, CEO, GCMD, said, “Bringing FEET to life has taken persistence and a willingness from everyone involved to step into the unknown. There was no playbook; our teams were learning as we went. This is exactly the kind of collaborative, problem-solving mindset needed to move the needle on maritime decarbonisation.”

“My hope is that FEET will accelerate the uptake of shipboard energy efficiency solutions and help unlock the scale of action needed to turn the industry’s decarbonisation ambition into tangible progress.”

Benny Hilstroem, Vice President of Market Development at Swiss marine power company WinGD, in an article published on Thursday (20 November), highlighted that LNG remains a strong, credible transition pathway, especially as the industry navigates uncertainty around global carbon pricing and clean-fuel incentives:

With or without the IMO Net Zero Framework, LNG remains a viable transition pathway towards decarbonisation and, with X-DF technology, ultra-low air pollution.

Going into the extraordinary session of IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee in mid-October, many in the industry had high hopes that the Net Zero Framework (NZF) would be adopted. WinGD was and remains one of the believers; incentivising the production and uptake of clean fuels is the only way to meet both IMO emissions ambitions and wider global climate targets.

The NZF does not mean, as some have suggested, that the case for LNG fuel or for installing dual-fuel LNG technology is over. Just like our X-DF-A ammonia-fuelled and X-DF-M methanol-fuelled engines, our X-DF dual-fuel LNG engines are ready to use zero or near-zero emissions (ZNZ) fuels. In the case of LNG those ZNZ fuels are bio-methane and e-methane, produced using captured carbon and renewable electricity, which can be used without modification and in any blend in X-DF engines.

Had the NZF been adopted with reduction targets and penalties stringent enough to drive people towards bio-methane, and rewards high enough to encourage e-methane production and use, the transition towards those fuels would have come sooner. A pause in implementing the policy only pushes the transition from fossil LNG further down the road.

That is why the NZF delay has made more operators consider LNG propulsion. Without a global carbon pricing policy and immediate e-fuel incentives, it remains the most affordable, widely available and well-established of all marine alternative fuels. Even fossil LNG can push vessels a long way towards the 30% reduction in emissions sought by 2030—an intermediate checkpoint under IMO’s GHG reduction strategy (which remains in place even after the NZF vote postponement).

WinGD’s X-DF concept has been in service since 2016, with more than 900 engines sold. Over that time we have amassed more than 8 million running hours of experience and continuously refined fuel consumption and emissions performance via innovations including iCER and VCR technology.

Advancing GHG benefits

Take methane slip as an example. In less than a decade we have reduced slippage by 60%, thanks to iCER, VCR and other design adaptations. Combined with low fuel consumption, this means that X-DF outperforms current high-pressure LNG engines in total greenhouse gas emissions in several vessel applications. In even more applications, low opex and initial system costs mean that total vessel lifecycle costs remain lower for X-DF than for high-pressure counterparts, regardless of IMO penalties.

Time in the market and continuous improvement have enabled us to develop an engine platform that will yield the best performance whether operating in fossil LNG or biological or synthetic derivatives. Regardless of the status of NZF, those years of refinements will pay dividends for operators choosing methane.

What happens next is far from clear. If the global framework were to fail, a patchwork of regional regulatory regimes would likely follow. Across several regions, port authorities are working to lower air pollution in their communities. It is therefore possible that, as regions regulate, they expand the scope of emissions policy to include not only GHG but also air pollutants.

In such a case, X-DF again has benefits for operators, offering the best air pollution profile of any LNG dual-fuel engine. That includes SOx, NOx and particulate matter. While IMO’s threshold requirements for NOx and SOx hide X-DF’s advantages, under schemes where operators pay for polluting the air, its low emissions profile would translate to real cost savings.

The Net Zero Framework would not have killed the use of LNG, but its pause certainly enhances the business case. Regardless, WinGD’s near decade of optimising the X-DF platform mean operators will pay less, whether they use fossil LNG or transition to cleaner variants. And it opens up new opportunities for air pollution improvements that could also have a significant financial impact on operators.

,,2025-11-24 01:35:59+00:00,Euractiv,"Sustainable maritime fuels must be accessible, says cruise ship CEO - Euractiv",Brian Maguire,,,,,https://www.euractiv.com/interview/sustainable-maritime-fuels-must-be-accessible-says-cruise-ship-ceo/,"Achieving this ambition hinges on three critical paths: fuels, fuels, and fuels.
Today, 25 cruise ships operate with next-generation multi-fuel engines, and this is expected to grow to more than 50 by 2036.
From CLIA’s perspective, Europe must keep its shipyards competitive, expand research and innovation funding, and make sure sustainable maritime fuels are accessible.
OPS installations on cruise ships have tripled since 2018 and now cover 58% of the cruise fleet (65% of total capacity).
Approximately 80% of ocean-going cruise ships are equipped with Advanced Wastewater Treatment Systems (AWTS), representing 84% of global passenger capacity.","In 2022, cruise ship companies pledged to pursue net-zero emissions by 2050. Three years later, those companies say they need more policy signals from the European Union to stimulate the investments needed both on land and at sea to make this happen.

Euractiv spoke with Budd Darr, CEO of the Cruise Line International Association (CLIA) and former executive vice president of government affairs at the MSC Group, about where the industry finds itself in 2025 and what it’s watching for EU policy.

EV: How is the health of the cruise industry in the post-COVID period? Where is the most growth coming from – returning customers or new ones?

BD: Cruise is one of the most resilient and responsible tourism sectors that continues to deliver exceptional guest experiences. The industry has moved well beyond recovery and is now experiencing managed, sustainable growth with a strong environmental focus.

In 2024, 34.6 million people worldwide took an ocean cruise, and this year we estimate 37.7 million people will choose to cruise, which speaks to both strong demand and high traveller confidence. We are seeing demand both from returning guests and new-to-cruise travellers.

Over the past two years, 31% of passengers were first-time cruisers, up from 27% in 2023. At the same time, repeat intent remains exceptionally strong: about 85% of past cruisers say they intend to cruise again, according to our latest research. That is one of the highest repeat-intent rates in the entire travel sector.

EV: What are the chief policy and financing obstacles in Europe for the cruise industry right now?

BD: In 2022, our cruise line members collectively pledged to pursue net-zero emissions by 2050, underscoring a strong, industry-wide commitment to environmental responsibility and sustainability. Achieving this ambition hinges on three critical paths: fuels, fuels, and fuels.

Right now, no single alternative fuel is available globally at scale, and that’s why fuel flexibility is so important.

Our cruise line members are investing tens of billions of euros in new ships and multi-fuel engines that can handle more than one solution.

Today, 25 cruise ships operate with next-generation multi-fuel engines, and this is expected to grow to more than 50 by 2036. These fuel-flexible engine technologies give our member cruise lines the ability to operate on LNG, methanol, or other fuels as supply chains develop – and to transition to lower- and zero-carbon fuels, such as bioLNG (methane), green methanol, or synthetic fuels such as e-LNG.

Across the maritime sector – whether under the EU Emissions Trading System, the IMO, or local rules on operational emissions – there is a clear need for safe and competitively priced fuels available at scale. Equally important are supportive funding mechanisms at both the EU and national levels to help drive the innovation required to meet decarbonisation targets. Progress depends on predictable regulation and effective financing tools.

Currently, only a small share of revenues collected under the EU ETS for maritime is reinvested in the sector.

CLIA advocates for 100% of maritime ETS proceeds to be directed back into ships, ports, shipyards, and innovation projects across the maritime value chain to accelerate decarbonisation while safeguarding Europe’s competitiveness.

The forthcoming EU Maritime Industrial Strategy can help establish this enabling framework.

EV: How well does the EU Maritime Industrial Strategy respond to those obstacles and challenges?

BD: We welcome the upcoming EU Maritime Industrial Strategy, expected in early 2026, as an opportunity to reinforce Europe’s leadership in sustainable shipbuilding and maritime innovation. The cruise sector contributes around €170 billion globally and supports 1.8 million jobs. Three-quarters of those jobs are on land – demonstrating that our impact extends far beyond ships.

Europe’s shipyards are at the heart of this success, with 97% of the 81 new cruise ships on order, worth over €60 billion, being built in European yards. In fact, cruise ships represent more than 80% of the overall value of current shipbuilding in Europe. That reflects real confidence from investors and shipbuilders alike.

From CLIA’s perspective, Europe must keep its shipyards competitive, expand research and innovation funding, and make sure sustainable maritime fuels are accessible.

The EU should also align measures such as FuelEU Maritime and the ETS with IMO rules to avoid fragmentation.

A strong, coherent EU Maritime Industrial Strategy will secure Europe’s leadership, support responsible growth, and help make sure that maritime decarbonisation creates and sustains high-quality jobs across the continent.

EV: How important is it for the cruising industry to have diverse and secure energy supplies at ports? How helpful would it be to the industry if ports could become energy hubs? And, do you expect that the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan will be able to mobilise the financing needed to make these shore power and fuel system installations happen?

BD: European ports are already essential energy gateways – hosting, storing, and transmitting fuels. They can go even further by becoming true hubs for clean maritime fuels and energy. This ambition fits well with the Clean Energy Marine Hubs project that CLIA actively supports, alongside leadership from our partners at the International Association of Ports and Harbors and the International Chamber of Shipping.

Investment in onshore power supply (OPS) is a top infrastructure priority for European ports from 2026 to 2030. By 2028, more than 70% of the global ocean-going cruise fleet will be OPS-equipped. Yet, among Europe’s three busiest cruise ports, only one currently offers active OPS. Continued investment in OPS at Europe’s ports and greater pricing transparency will encourage broader use.

OPS installations on cruise ships have tripled since 2018 and now cover 58% of the cruise fleet (65% of total capacity). The industry plans to reach roughly 90% of capacity by 2036. Combined with the forthcoming EU Ports Strategy, these initiatives can unlock private and public financing, scale European-made fuels, and turn ports into genuine decarbonisation hubs.

The Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP) signals that the EU is serious about renewable and low-carbon fuels. It also acknowledges the role of fossil-based LNG as a transitional energy source – a technology the cruise industry adopted early, helping lay the groundwork for next-generation fuels.

Together with the forthcoming EU Ports Strategy, these initiatives can accelerate investment support by unlocking private and public financing, help scale European-produced fuels, and position ports as key energy hubs for maritime decarbonisation.

EV: The CLIA annual Environmental Technologies and Practices (ETP) report released last month found that there has been good progress in testing and piloting biofuels at port, investing in fuel-flexible engines, and increasing the use of lower-emissions fuels. In what areas do you think progress has been lacking and things should be moving faster?

BD: Although cruise ships account for less than 1% of the global maritime fleet, cruise lines are early adopters and innovators of new technologies – often paving the way for broader maritime use. This is evident in our members’ significant investments in advanced wastewater treatment systems, air lubrication systems, onshore power connectivity, and next-generation multi-fuel engines.

CLIA’s 2025 Environmental Technologies and Practices Report confirms these advancements.

Approximately 80% of ocean-going cruise ships are equipped with Advanced Wastewater Treatment Systems (AWTS), representing 84% of global passenger capacity.

Air lubrication systems and specialised hull coatings are increasingly used on ships to improve energy efficiency and reduce drag. Nearly two-thirds of the global cruise fleet can now connect to onshore power, cutting local emissions from ships at berth by up to 98%. The number of cruise ships with next-generation multi-fuel engines has grown from just one in 2018 to 25 today, with many more on order. And biofuel pilot projects are expanding in multiple European ports.

While progress is clear, achieving the cruise industry’s net-zero emissions ambition by 2050 requires the availability of safe, sustainable, and competitively priced fuels that do not yet exist today at scale. It also demands deeper collaboration between policymakers and industry – both in Europe and globally. The next decade is pivotal – not for promises, but for measurable progress toward a cleaner, more resilient maritime future.

In line with the growing need for ‘greener’ services, standards are increasingly focused on reducing GHG emissions too.","While significant inroads have been made on hybrid and electric adoption in workboats, pleasure craft and ferries, the industry currently faces a major bottleneck. Simply put, the lack of scalable on-board electrical infrastructure is slowing progress among larger ships and vessels.

This stems from the fact that these vessels are tailored around diesel propulsion and low-voltage auxiliary systems. These legacy systems are no longer suitable for modern maritime applications – they are ill-equipped to handle the high voltages, power densities, and thermal demands required for modern electric drives and energy storage systems.

At the same time, the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) are pushing for a significant reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from ships. Aiming for net-zero emissions by or around 2050, the IMO has laid out a clear roadmap for players within the sector to follow to achieve this. Interim targets include a 20-30% reduction in GHG emissions by 2030, and a 70-80% reduction by 2050.

To achieve this, the IMO has recommended a number of key strategies, including the use of alternative fuels and net-zero GHG emission technologies. Wider efforts to improve carbon intensity within the sector and increase the sustainability of marine ecosystems and fisheries have also been considered within the organisation’s recommendations.

The case for electrification

As a result, we have seen increased electrification of the marine sector in recent years. Shipbuilders and marine system integrators are actively replacing traditional fossil fuel powered engines with electric or hybrid-electric alternatives in order to reduce their GHG emission in line with the IMO’s targets.

Air and noise pollution can also be mitigated through electrical propulsion, especially for smaller, short-distance vessels which operate in sensitive areas like ports, waterways and coastal areas. This is crucial; air quality maps published by the European Environment Agency (EEA) in December 2024 highlighted higher annual mean Nitrogen Oxide (NO2) concentrations in port areas when compared to surrounding areas. In fact, some ports still exceed the 2030 limit value of 20 micrograms per cubic metre air (µg/m³), while nine ports across Europe also exceeded the new limit value for particulate matter of 10 micrometres (PM10) too.

There’re performance benefits to electrification too, as electric systems typically offer better acceleration and manoeuvrability. For larger vessels carrying cargo or a large volume of passengers, this functionality can help lead to more efficient operations. Increased efficiency also reduces the likelihood of expensive maintenance costs, meaning more economical operations.

Challenges ahead

However, while these solutions offer a more sustainable and optimal path forward for the industry in terms of zero-emission services and increased on-board performance, challenges still remain in scaling the necessary technology and infrastructure.

As the concept is relatively new, there remains some insufficiency in terms of the amount of charging infrastructure. The high costs and demand for procuring batteries and retrofitting existing vessels – which is also causing supply chain issues for scarce battery materials – and the current limited energy density for long-haul operations.

This is only compounded by the issue of durability, especially for larger vessels. When in service, the batteries are likely to encounter harsh environments and conditions. It’s imperative they withstand extreme and fluctuating temperatures, as well as contact with water, salt and any significant vibrations, all while providing consistent and reliable power for on-board systems.

Setting the standard for maritime solutions

Thankfully, vendors serving the marine sector have risen to this challenge. Creating solutions with longevity and performance in mind, one key area of focus has been the cabling used for critical on-board energy systems, especially those operating in demanding marine environments.

Solutions providers such as HUBER+SUHNER now offer cable families that deliver long-term durability in harsh conditions, combining high electrical performance with strong mechanical and chemical resistance.

Designed specifically for battery and fuel energy systems on vessels – making them suitable for both battery-powered and hybrid operations – new cable solutions are capable of working effectively at temperatures between -40 to 130°C, and for usage in applications such as battery wiring, on-board charges, and auxiliary systems, alongside AC/DC charging sockets and power distribution units (PDUs).

Pivotal to these efforts is certification. Classification organisations such as ISO, IEC and DNV have developed specific standards to ensure the highest possible levels of safety and performance for use across the marine industry.

DNV Type Approval ensures products or components meet specific standards for ships, offshore units, and high-speed craft; something which HUBER+SUHNER recently attained through approval on its RADOX 155(S) and Elastomer S cables.

These regulations ensure that shipbuilders and integrators can be assured the products they’ve procured will work optimally during operation, while at the same time, opening the door to new opportunities for the vendors who designed them.

In line with the growing need for ‘greener’ services, standards are increasingly focused on reducing GHG emissions too. Technologies and systems are validated thoroughly for carbon capture and renewable energy use through type approval processes and other programmes. DNV, for example, also verify emission reduction projects against well-established standards such as ISO 14064-2.

Looking to the future

Through these new solutions and relevant certifications, the maritime sector has gained positive momentum in terms of electrification. This is true of the wider transportation segment at large, and in fact, many of the standards required by vessel manufacturers and owners originate from other sectors, such as automotive.

However, for the sake of the market, vendors must remain committed to delivering future-proof solutions that meet the highest standards of safety, performance and sustainability. As we approach IMO’s initial 2030 benchmark for GHS emissions, the pressure to be environmentally-friendly – without compromising on vessel performance – is only going to grow.

By buying certified products, shipbuilders and integrators can give themselves the best possible chance to hit these stringent targets and drive greater electrification across the industry.",https://www.newelectronics.co.uk/media/nyrbusbr/adobestock_1404063326.jpg,N,,2025-11-23 14:56:30.912366

Introduction

The Suez Canal is a critical maritime artery, connecting the Red Sea to the Mediterranean, facilitating roughly 12-15% of global trade and about 30% of container traffic. It handles approximately 9.2 million barrels of oil daily and generates significant toll revenue for Egypt, crucial for the nation’s economy. Given its strategic importance, any disruption in the Suez Canal can lead to significant ripple effects on global commerce and energy markets, underscoring the need for robust security measures.

Historical Context and Vulnerabilities

The canal’s strategic significance has made it a focal point during historical conflicts. The Suez Crisis in 1956 and the Eight-year closure beginning in 1967 resulted in unprecedented shipping disruptions, compelling vessels to take longer routes. These crises illustrated the canal’s leverage in geopolitics and resulted in significant economic losses, prompting shippers to adjust their operations.

Since then, the canal has remained a vital trade conduit amid regional tensions. However, various security threats still linger, as evidenced by a 2013 foiled terrorist attack and recent assaults on shipping during the Israel-Gaza conflict that began in late 2023, where Houthi rebels targeted vessels in the Red Sea.

Recent Conflicts and Their Impacts

The ongoing attacks by Houthi forces on commercial shipping have prompted significant disruptions. Many shipping firms suspended or rerouted vessels, leading to a 50% reduction in trade volume through the canal in early 2024. A spike in transportation costs and insurance premiums further strained global supply chains, resulting in delays and increased freight rates. The conflicts also affected oil volumes transiting the canal, pushing Brent crude prices higher and leading to a marked decline in global shipping capacity.

Global Economic Ramifications

The conflicts around the Suez Canal and the resulting shipping disruptions have far-reaching economic implications, particularly for businesses relying on timely deliveries. Many companies were unable to meet production schedules, which could lead to inflationary pressures in affected economies. Additionally, the spike in marine insurance costs has made using the canal prohibitively expensive for many shippers, resulting in increased reliance on longer routes like the Cape of Good Hope, which yield higher emissions and environmental costs.

The Way Forward: Ensuring Canal Security

Addressing the security vulnerabilities of the Suez Canal is fundamentally an international concern demanding a coordinated approach to ensure maritime safety. A strategic priority should be fostering collaboration among regional and international naval forces to establish protective measures around the Red Sea and beyond. Concepts such as multinational maritime patrols and intelligence-sharing systems could help mitigate risks.

Investments in the canal’s infrastructure, along with technological advancements for surveillance and security, will be crucial. Increasing the capacity to handle larger vessels and establishing advanced communication systems can fortify maritime safety measures.

Conclusion

The Suez Canal’s health is intrinsically linked to global trade stability. Ongoing conflicts in the surrounding regions highlight the canal’s vulnerability, reinforcing the necessity of maintaining its operational integrity through enhanced security and proactive diplomatic efforts. Policymakers and industry stakeholders must realign their strategies to bolster both the canal’s resilience and the broader supply chain systems it supports, ensuring this vital trade artery remains open and secure.",https://cdn-kdmmj.nitrocdn.com/rMIbIrPSYFfiGCokvtkImuATKIjcDThC/assets/images/optimized/rev-41bbbe8/maritimefairtrade.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/cropped-maritime-fairtrade-favicon-1-32x32.png,N,,2025-11-22 20:56:09.099215

Meeting for the first time since the adjournment of the IMO’s MEPC ES meeting in October, INTERTANKO’s Council has reinforced the Association’s commitment to a single global regulatory framework that includes certainty on the use of transitional pathways to meet the IMO’s greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction targets.

INTERTANKO’s Deputy Director, Environment Emma Scheiris said: “This decision is a testament to the Members’ continued commitment and alignment on driving decarbonisation forward, notwithstanding the different pathways used to achieve their emission reduction goals.”

Managing Director, Tim Wilkins added: “INTERTANKO has been consistent in its approach to achieving a global solution through the IMO to meet the 2023 IMO GHG reduction targets, while respecting the ‘Polluter Pays’ principle. The Association has also been clear that to achieve these targets, the full spectrum of transitional pathways must be supported by the regulatory framework, ranging from energy-saving devices and wind-assisted propulsion to alternative fuels such as LNG and sustainable biofuels, and net-zero technologies such as shore power and carbon capture.”

Members voiced their support for INTERTANKO to continue its active role in contributing to the IMO’s draft guidelines and working collaboratively with all stakeholders to validate the transitional pathways. The validity of these pathways has already been assessed by many INTERTANKO Member companies, with evidence emerging that they can form the basis for meeting the reduction targets beyond 2040 and up to 2050. The consolidated data and information support the environmental and business case for using transitional pathways to meet the IMO’s GHG reduction targets. This should form the basis of discussions on the current trajectories and the agreement of a simple and practical legislative framework.

It is important now to gather evidence on the various measures available to reduce GHG emissions from ships. INTERTANKO will form a working group of Member companies to validate these transitional pathways with practical, real-world experience. Recognising that any information gathered must be supplemented with data on the use and supply of certain measures from outside the Association’s membership, the group has been tasked to collaborate with experts and interested parties.

“Success hinges on timing. Evidence supporting transitional pathways must be presented to IMO early enough to influence and shape a global solution,” said Wilkins. “Validating the transitional pathways with real-world data and analysis should provide regulators with the confidence to incorporate these pathways into the global framework and provide the certainty and confidence in the regulatory process that the industry requires.”",https://allaboutshipping.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/INTERTANKO-MD-Tim-Wilkins-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-22 09:56:35.549001
