The statement was signed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, and Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy.

In the U.S. statement, retaliatory measures against nations voting for the plan could include:

Blocking vessels from U.S. ports;

Probes and possible regulations over those nations’ anti-competitive practices;

Visa restrictions for vessel crews;

Penalties covering U.S. government contracts for new commercial ships and liquified natural gas terminals;

Additional port fees on ships owned, operated, or flagged by those countries;

Sanctions on officials sponsoring activist-driven climate policies.

“The United States will be moving to levy these remedies against nations that sponsor this European-led neocolonial export of global climate regulations. We will fight hard to protect our economic interests by imposing costs on countries if they support the NZF. Our fellow IMO members should be on notice.”

Washington had previously worked closely with the IMO on GHG regulations. The reversal is not unprecedented: The U.S. was central to the development of the International Criminal Court, but has never ratified the treaty recognizing its authority.

The new measures come as the U.S. escalates its trade war with China. Costly fees on Chinese-built and -operated cargo ships calling American ports are slated to take effect Tuesday; new tariffs more than doubling the cost of Chinese-made container cranes and other equipment are set to take effect Nov. 1.

Beijing has retaliated with port fees on U.S. shipping, also effective Oct. 14.

“[The Arctic route] greatly enhances supply chain speed, reduces required business inventory by 40 percent and cuts capital costs for businesses,” Sealegend’s Li explained.
It crossed Russia’s Northern Sea Route in just 5 days at an average speed of 17 knots.
Russia’s Northern Sea Route has set a new record for containership activity this summer surpassing more than 20 transits.","Chinese containership Istanbul Bridge is scheduled to arrive at the UK’s largest terminal Felixstowe during the afternoon of October 13. The Panamax vessel completed the 7,500 nautical mile voyage from China via the Arctic Northern Sea Route in just 20 days. A comparable voyage through the Suez Canal measures 11,000 nautical miles and routinely takes between 40-50 days.

Istanbul Bridge’s voyage is the first liner-type service via the polar region connecting Asia and Europe and calling at several Chinese and European ports. It is also the first time a container ship has traveled from China to the UK via the Arctic.

Sealegend, the operator of the Istanbul Bridge, calls the new service “China-Europe Arctic Express”. The company laid the foundation for the route with the acquisition of the Ice-1 ice-class containership last year.

The company’s Chief Operating Officer Li Xiaobin highlighted the reduced emissions of the shorter Arctic voyage. But environmental advocates warn of the local impact of emissions, especially if vessels are using heavy fuel oil resulting in black carbon emissions. It is unclear what type of fuel the Istanbul Bridge was using during its transit and if it was in full compliance with the IMO’s Polar Code.

Istanbul Bridge’s Arctic voyage aims to beat the Fall rush into European terminals when containerships arrive delivering Asian goods for the holiday season.

“[The Arctic route] greatly enhances supply chain speed, reduces required business inventory by 40 percent and cuts capital costs for businesses,” Sealegend’s Li explained.

Loaded with up to 4,843 standard containers (TEU) the box carrier departed from Ningbo-Zhoushan on September 22. It crossed Russia’s Northern Sea Route in just 5 days at an average speed of 17 knots. This late in the summer navigation season very little sea ice remains along the main Arctic shipping lane. The vessel did not receive any icebreaker escort and navigated independently along the entire length of the route.

After the Felixstowe port call the carrier will continue onward to Rotterdam, Hamburg and Gdansk. While Istanbul Bridge has received much of the public media attention in recent weeks, it is not the only container shipping company testing the Arctic waters. A least three other box carriers were active on the route at the same time conducting point-to-point voyages. Russia’s Northern Sea Route has set a new record for containership activity this summer surpassing more than 20 transits.

The first full transit of a containership came just 7 years ago in August 2018 when operator Maersk sent the feeder-class Venta Maersk from Vladivostok to St. Petersburg, with a stop in Bremerhaven. Since then Western operators have largely backed away from the route for environmental and political reasons ceding the Arctic waters to Chinese operators.

While the route remains very niche – in 2024 it saw around 100 vessel transits compared to 13,000 for the Suez Canal – a number of companies have continuously expanded their Arctic operations.",https://gcaptain.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Flying-Fish-2023-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-13 14:57:11.767346

These ships are responsible for over 85 per cent of global shipping emissions and are already covered by reporting requirements for fuel data collection.","WASHINGTON, CMC – The United States has issued a warning to countries, including those in the Caribbean, that plan to vote later this month in support of measures being pushed by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) for a Net-Zero Shipping Framework (NZF) aimed at reducing reducing emissions in the maritime sector.

“The United States will be moving to levy these remedies against nations that sponsor this European-led neocolonial export of global climate regulations. We will fight hard to protect our economic interests by imposing costs on countries if they support the NZF. Our fellow IMO members should be on notice,” according to a joint statement issued by the Secretary of State Rubio, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, and Secretary of Transportation Sean P Duffy.

The measure, which was approved in April 2025, is set for adoption in October 2025, during the Marine Environmental Protection Committee that is meeting that takes place until October 17.

IMO officials say 108 members are eligible to vote, including 10 from CARICOM and, if adopted, it will come into effect in 2028.

But Washington has said that President Donald Trump has made it clear that the United States will not accept any international environmental agreement that unduly or unfairly burdens the United States or harms the interests of the American people.

It said that this week’s vote on the adoption “will be the first time that a UN organization levies a global carbon tax on the world.

“The Administration unequivocally rejects this proposal before the IMO and will not tolerate any action that increases costs for our citizens, energy providers, shipping companies and their customers, or tourists.

“The economic impacts from this measure could be disastrous, with some estimates forecasting global shipping costs increasing as much as 10 per cent or more. We ask you to join us in rejecting adoption of the NZF at the October meeting and to work together on our collective economic and energy security,” the joint statement said.

The NZF seeks to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from international shipping to align with the 2050 net-zero target. Key components include a Global Fuel Standard (GFS) setting annual GHG intensity reduction targets, a two-tier carbon price mechanism, and a credit trading system funded by penalties to reward zero and near-zero emission fuels and support a just transition.

The NZF presents a new regulatory era in which ships will be required to gradually adopt fuels that are typically three to four times more expensive compared with conventional fossil fuels. Given the long lifespan of ships, shipowners should prepare now for the new net-zero GHG emission regulations to ensure cost-effective compliance, both at the ship and the fleet level.

The Framework will apply to all oceangoing ships over 5,000 gross tonnage (GT). These ships are responsible for over 85 per cent of global shipping emissions and are already covered by reporting requirements for fuel data collection. Ships under 5,000 GT are currently not covered.

Washington said that the NZF proposal poses significant risks to the global economy and subjects not just Americans, but all IMO member states “to an unsanctioned global tax regime that levies punitive and regressive financial penalties, which could be avoided.”

The United States says it is considering several actions against countries that support “this global carbon tax on American consumers”.

Among the measures being contemplated are pursuing investigations and considering potential regulations to combat anti-competitive practices from certain flagged countries and potential blocking of vessels registered in those countries from US ports; imposing visa restrictions including an increase in fees and processing, mandatory re-interview requirements and/or revisions of quotas for C-1/D maritime crew member visas.

In addition, Washington said it will impose commercial penalties stemming from US government contracts including new commercial ships, liquefied natural gas terminals and infrastructure, and/or other financial penalties on ships flagged under nations in favour of the NZF;

It will also be imposing additional port fees on ships owned, operated, or flagged by countries supporting the framework as well as evaluating sanctions on officials sponsoring activist-driven climate policies that would burden American consumers, among other measures under consideration.",https://jamaica-gleaner.com/sites/default/files/styles/250px/public/media/article_images/2025/10/13/3255802/8384944.jpg?itok=Z-2FijSK,N,,2025-10-13 13:56:06.930510

The IMO’s extraordinary session (MEPC E.2) is scheduled for October 14-17, where member states are expected to vote on adopting the Net-Zero Framework—a carbon-pricing regime targeting the international shipping sector. The package combines a tightening marine fuel-intensity standard with a priced compliance mechanism that would channel revenues into an IMO Net-Zero Fund for low-carbon rewards, infrastructure, and transition support.

In a joint statement issued last Friday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, and Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy declared that “President Trump has made it clear that the United States will not accept any international environmental agreement that unduly or unfairly burdens the United States or harms the interests of the American people.”

The administration warned that “the economic impacts from this measure could be disastrous, with some estimates forecasting global shipping costs increasing as much as 10% or more.” The statement characterized the NZF proposal as posing “significant risks to the global economy” and subjecting all IMO member states to “an unsanctioned global tax regime that levies punitive and regressive financial penalties.”

The U.S. outlined several potential countermeasures against nations supporting the framework, including pursuing investigations and considering potential regulations to combat anti-competitive practices from certain flagged countries and potential blocking of vessels registered in those countries from U.S. ports. The administration also threatened to impose visa restrictions including an increase in fees and processing, mandatory re-interview requirements and revisions of quotas for C-1/D maritime crew member visas.

Additional measures under consideration include imposing commercial penalties stemming from U.S. government contracts including new commercial ships, liquified natural gas terminals and infrastructure, and other financial penalties on ships flagged under nations in favor of the NZF. The administration also said it would consider imposing additional port fees on ships owned, operated, or flagged by countries supporting the framework, and evaluating sanctions on officials sponsoring activist-driven climate policies that would burden American consumers.

“The United States will be moving to levy these remedies against nations that sponsor this European-led neocolonial export of global climate regulations,” the statement declared. “We will fight hard to protect our economic interests by imposing costs on countries if they support the NZF. Our fellow IMO members should be on notice.”

Despite the U.S. threats, the European Union released a statement in support of the framework. “The EU supports ambitious global measures at International Maritime Organization (IMO) level with a view to decarbonise the shipping sector, and ensure a global level playing field,” the EU Directorate-General for Mobility and Transport stated. “The EU views the Net-Zero Framework as a significant milestone and calls for its adoption at IMO next week.”

The EU statement added that “after the adoption, the European Commission will review the relevant EU regulations in place.”

The framework would apply to ships greater than 5,000 gross tons, covering approximately 85 percent of international shipping emissions.Vessels that overshoot intensity thresholds would be required to acquire remedial units, while efficient ships could bank or trade surplus units.If adopted, the framework could enter into force in 2027.

The U.S. position contrasts sharply with industry sentiment. Major shipping associations, including liner and shipowner groups, have urged governments to pass the package. In a joint statement issued October 9, leading international maritime associations declared: “Only global rules will decarbonise a global industry. Without the Framework, shipping would risk a growing patchwork of unilateral regulations, increasing costs without effectively contributing to decarbonisation.”

The industry statement continued: “With the support of the industry, this is a unique and historic opportunity for governments to put in place a comprehensive global framework, which will be strictly enforced worldwide, to incentivise the shipping industry’s transition to net zero emissions whilst ensuring a level playing field.”

The signatories to the industry statement represent major portions of global shipping. The Asian Shipowners’ Association represents around 50 percent of the world merchant fleet.European shipowners control 35 percent of the global commercial fleet. The International Chamber of Shipping represents over 80 percent of the world merchant fleet.

Shipping accounts for approximately 90 percent of world trade and contributes roughly 3 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions. Proponents argue that a uniform price signal and enforceable standard would align shipowners, bunkering, and ports on a common decarbonization path.

Despite the U.S. warnings, backers of the framework expect sufficient votes for adoption following April’s approval in principle, though late abstentions could affect the final tally.If the framework passes, a technical group is scheduled to meet October 20-24 to finalize guidance on fuel definitions, revenue spending, and compliance rules ahead of the 2027 implementation timeline.",https://gcaptain.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/shutterstock_1443851123.jpg,N,,2025-10-13 12:56:22.552654

This week, IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee is holding an extraordinary session of to consider adoption of the proposed carbon tax on shipping that IMO calls the “Net Zero Framework” (NZF). The session looks set to be contentious, to say the least.

In a brief statement released yesterday, the European Commission said:

“The EU supports ambitious global measures at International Maritime Organization (IMO) level with a view to decarbonize the shipping sector, and ensure a global level playing field. The EU views the Net-Zero Framework as a significant milestone and calls for its adoption at IMO next week.

“After the adoption, the European Commission will review the relevant EU regulations in place.”

That statement was released after an October 10 announcement re-stating U.S. opposition to what Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, and Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy called a “European-led neocolonial export of global climate regulations.”

A statement by the three cabinet secretaries laid out actions the U.S. is considering taking should the NZF proposal succeed.

Here’s the full text of the statement.

“President Trump has made it clear that the United States will not accept any international environmental agreement that unduly or unfairly burdens the United States or harms the interests of the American people.

The International Maritime Organization’s updated greenhouse gas strategy sets a net-zero ambition “by or around 2050,” with waypoints for 2030 and 2040, and an expectation that zero or near-zero fuels begin showing up in meaningful volumes by 2030. Regional policies are already operational, as is interim IMO guidance, which also locks in a well-to-wake1 view of emissions.

Multiple decarbonization pathways are advancing, through efficiency upgrades, route optimization, alternative fuels and onboard capture. But near-term progress depends on access to compliant molecules at scale, with defensible lifecycle carbon and recognized certification. Capital will back options that leverage existing assets while other technologies mature. That is where ethanol is relevant.

The U.S. operates a large, export-ready ethanol infrastructure with roughly 18 billion gallons of nameplate capacity, steady production and record exports of near 2 billion gallons last year. Plants, rail, barge and port connections exist today. That footprint can support marine supply chains now and, where needed, feed conversion processes that yield candidate blendstocks for the distillate pool.

Methanol has driven real momentum in alternative-fuel newbuilds and retrofits. Public sources indicate by mid-2024, methanol accounted for roughly 9% of the global orderbook by vessel count (about 242 ships)2. As of early 2025, around 60 methanol-fueled vessels were in operation and about 340 were on order3. Industry materials also referenced roughly 700 “methanol-ready”4 designs5. That installed base is valuable infrastructure for alcohol fuels in general, and ethanol complements it. Ethanol and methanol are both simple alcohols with similar handling and safety requirements under the IMO’s low-flashpoint rules, so the same broad tank, piping, ventilation and detection concepts apply. That platform overlap makes methanol-capable designs a logical starting point for ethanol with original equipment manufacturer (OEM) calibration and targeted material changes. On a volumetric basis, ethanol offers higher energy density, helping extend range or reduce tankage. For owners and charterers, dual-fuel optionality across both alcohols diversifies feedstock risk, broadens sourcing and strengthens the procurement stack without forcing a binary choice.

With methanol-capable platforms now common, ethanol slots in as an add-on rather than a redesign. OEMs are already running compression-ignition trials with a pilot fuel, and the same IMO low-flashpoint rules apply. The near-term fit is controllable fleets through harbor craft, inland towboats and offshore support. This is where ethanol’s ultra-low sulfur/aromatics and particulate reductions matter; the known trade-offs versus marine gasoil (materials and energy density) can be handled with selective seal/line upgrades and engine control unit recalibration, then taken through testbeds, class approval and sea trials. Thus, shipowners get access to comparable power and emissions at modest capital, and a second audited fuel that spreads supply and compliance risk.",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Ankit_Chandra_Senior_Manager_of_Ethanol_Export_Development_62f5177979.jpg,N,,2025-10-13 12:56:38.102259

With major energy projects under development in the North Sea and Southeast Asia, these regions will form the core of its operational activity.

Designed entirely in-house, the George W. Goethals will become the third rock installation vessel above 30,000 tonnes in the Jan De Nul fleet.

“Decades of hands-on experience have given us deep expertise in subsea rock installation,” said Philippe Hutse, director, offshore, energy at Jan De Nul. We have applied this knowledge throughout the vessel’s design. The collective capacity of our subsea rock installation fleet now surges beyond 100,000 tonnes. This investment will strengthen our leading position in the industry.”

The George W. Goethals will be an ultra-low emission vessel (ULEV) with a highly advanced dual exhaust filter system which removes up to 99% of nanoparticles from emissions using a diesel particulate filter and a NOx reduction system. The system also significantly reduces exhaust gas pollutants.

With this technology, the vessel will comply with the strict European Stage V emission standards for inland waterway vessels. Additionally, NOx emissions will be reduced to an extent that will see the vessel meet the even stricter EURO VI emission limits.

The George W. Goethals will be able to operate on biofuel and green methanol, significantly reducing CO2 emissions. It will have hybrid power plant on board that combines the generators with a battery and drive technology, designed for peak shaving, load smoothening, spinning reserve and optimized engine loading.

The vessel will be equipped with four electric excavators. Among other applications, they will be used for loading large size rocks, enabling efficient operations without the need for a dedicated conveyor belt or crane on shore.

To ensure precision and efficiency in subsea rock installation, the vessel will feature key equipment supplied by Fincantieri Group member Remazel Engineering that includes a vertical and an inclined fall pipe system, as well as a rock transport system for rock installation at depths up to 400 meters and for supporting an installation rate up to 2,000 tons/hour.

“We are thrilled to collaborate with Jan De Nul on this significant project and to contribute our expertise in offshore equipment engineering,” said Remazel Engineering CEO Andrea Rosa. “This contract underscores our commitment to delivering advanced solutions for subsea infrastructure and offshore construction.”

The vessel’s namesake, George Washington Goethals (1858–1921), the son of Belgian immigrants, was an American military officer and civil engineer best known for overseeing the construction and opening of the Panama Canal.",https://www.marinelog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GeorgeWGoethals_Deployed_Vertical_4.jpg,N,,2025-10-13 11:57:05.536352

The U.S. described the proposal as posing “significant economic risks” and creating an unsanctioned global tax system.

While the U.S. remains opposed, major container shipping companies believe a global regulatory framework is essential to speed up decarbonisation in the industry. At the same time, some of the world’s largest oil tanker operators have expressed serious concerns over the proposal.

Supporters of the IMO initiative have cautioned that, without international regulation, the shipping industry could face a mix of local rules that would increase operational costs without effectively reducing emissions.

The upcoming vote is expected to play a key role in shaping global shipping, trade, and climate policy, as countries weigh economic risks against the need to reduce emissions from one of the world’s most polluting industries.

“Too many wastewater treatment plants are failing to meet licence standards due to poor management and maintenance practices,” added Noel Byrne, EPA programme manager.
When treatment plants break down or are not managed properly, our environment pays the price.
“The EPA has prosecuted Uisce Éireann on 28 occasions for failing to treat wastewater properly.
Uisce Éireann must take immediate action to improve the operation and management of treatment plants and implement effective maintenance programmes to prevent equipment breakdowns.” Read more here.","Ireland’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has said that while the volume of raw sewage discharged daily in Ireland from wastewater plants has halved since the start of last year, close to three fifths (59%) of water discharged from said plans failed to consistently meet EPA standards.

The environmental protection body said that nearly half of these failures were down to ‘poor operational management at existing treatment plants’, however it noted that delays by Ireland’s water authority, Uisce Éireann, in delivering much-needed infrastructure improvements are prolonging risks to water quality.

Priority areas

Investment in key focus areas has reaped benefits, but a lot more needs to be done, Pat Byrne, director of the EPA’s Office of Radiation Protection and Environmental Monitoring, commented, “Targeting improvements at priority areas identified by the EPA is delivering environmental benefits. The new treatment plants built to stop discharges of raw sewage from areas such as Arklow and Kilrush are clear examples of this progress.

“However, delays in designing and delivering infrastructural upgrades required at many more areas are prolonging negative impacts on water quality and the wider environment.”

The EPA said that operational and maintenance issues ‘can and must’ be resolved as a matter of urgency, while infrastructural deficits represent a longer-term challenge that will require substantial and sustained investment.

Uisce Éireann

The EPA has identified some 78 priority areas where improvements need to be made, with Uisce Éireann yet to commence works needed at half of these.

“Uisce Éireann must accelerate the pace of delivery of essential upgrades at priority areas to ensure cleaner rivers, estuaries, lakes and coastal waters and support a healthier environment for all,” Byrne added.

As the EPA noted, some 14 large towns and cities across Ireland failed to meet European-wide wastewater treatment standards in 2024, compared to six the previous year, an indication that Uisce Éireann needs to take urgent action to ‘prevent previously compliant treatment plants slipping into non-compliance’.

“Too many wastewater treatment plants are failing to meet licence standards due to poor management and maintenance practices,” added Noel Byrne, EPA programme manager. “This is simply not good enough. When treatment plants break down or are not managed properly, our environment pays the price.

There’s an old saying in politics that suggests “if you’re not at the table, you’re on the menu.” Sure, the adage is overused and a bit cliché. But it aptly describes events that will be occurring in London this week, the outcomes of which could have important long-term consequences for the future competitiveness of America’s renewable producers and farmers.

Diplomats from around the world will meet in England’s capital city October 14–17 to vote on whether to adopt a new set of international regulations focused on reducing GHG emissions from oceangoing ships. And whether the interests of U.S. fuel producers, farmers, and shippers are at the table—or on the menu—remains to be seen.

This proposed regulatory program, developed by the International Maritime Organization (IMO), is known as the “Net-Zero Framework” and operates similarly to a low carbon fuel standard for on-road fuels (like those already in place in California, Oregon, Washington, and Canada). In accordance with annual standards, ships must gradually reduce their GHG emissions over time by using lower-carbon fuels in place of traditional fossil-based marine fuel. Ship operators who use fuels with lifecycle carbon intensity values below the annual standard will generate tradeable and bankable credits, while ships that exceed the annual carbon intensity threshold will generate deficits. Those deficits must be offset by acquiring credits from over-compliant shippers and/or by paying into a proposed IMO Net-Zero Fund, which will be used to financially reward low-emission ships, support research and innovation, and for other purposes. Marine shipping companies around the world, including U.S. businesses, have voiced their support for the IMO program.

The U.S. ethanol industry sees the IMO Net-Zero Framework as an enormous potential market opportunity for American-made renewable fuels produced from American-grown crops like corn, sorghum, and soybeans. How enormous? Well, the ships that would be subject to the IMO regulations typically consume roughly 70–80 billion gallons of fuel per year worldwide. To put that in perspective, total U.S. ethanol production last year was 16.1 billion gallons. Even if U.S. ethanol captured just 5 percent of the global maritime fuel market, it would equate to a game-changing demand boost of 4–5 billion gallons, while simultaneously increasing corn demand by 1.5 billion bushels or more. Just imagine the economic impact that this sort of new demand would have on the rural communities where ethanol is produced and corn is grown.

Today, most (roughly 93 percent) marine fuel is petroleum-based fuel oil and diesel/gas oil (“bunker fuels”), while about 6 percent is liquified natural gas (LNG). Meanwhile, considerably less than 1 percent of current maritime fuel needs are met with biofuels or other low-carbon alternative fuels. Adoption of the Net-Zero Framework would change that—and change it quickly.

According to Department of Energy (DOE) analyses, U.S. corn ethanol used for maritime fuel could reduce GHG emissions by 61 percent compared to the traditional fossil-based marine fuels being used today. DOE’s research also shows a 66 percent GHG reduction for U.S. soy biodiesel used as marine fuel and a 60 percent reduction for soy-based renewable diesel. That means ships using low-cost, American-made ethanol, biodiesel, and renewable diesel could generate credits and easily comply with the annual IMO standards (which, if approved, are set to take effect in 2027), through at least 2038. U.S.-produced LNG and biogas would also serve as attractive options under the Net-Zero Framework.

The IMO program represents an unprecedented opportunity for ensuring American energy dominance in an emerging global market, leveraging existing infrastructure and investments, and enhancing the economic resiliency of U.S. agriculture and rural communities.

Thus, we were more than a little surprised when Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, and Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy issued a statement in August stating that the Trump Administration “unequivocally rejects this proposal before the IMO.” The statement also encouraged other IMO member countries to vote against the proposal this week.

The administration’s opposition appears rooted in its notion that the IMO framework would “preclude the use of proven technologies such as liquefied natural gas (LNG) and biofuels.” We don’t see it that way. Again, according to DOE’s own analysis, U.S. ethanol—the lowest-cost alternative fuel available at scale worldwide—would be an incredibly competitive marine fuel option under the program. Major players in the marine engine and shipping industries are already acknowledging ethanol’s potential. Indeed, one marine engine manufacturer recently called adoption of the Net-Zero Framework “a beautiful case for those who have ethanol capabilities installed already” due to ethanol’s “handling benefits, growing availability and competitive pricing.”

But if U.S. leaders leave the table, they will most certainly cede this important market opportunity to our biofuel and agriculture competitors in Brazil, China, and Europe. They’ll also leave a leadership void that proponents of uneconomical, unproven, fantasy fuel technologies will be all too happy to fill.",https://ethanolrfa.org/image/640/1000/Container-Ship.jpg,N,,2025-10-13 11:57:40.266229

The Earth has passed its first climate tipping point

A new Global Tipping Points report led by the University of Exeter warns the Earth has crossed its first catastrophic climate threshold: the irreversible decline of warm-water coral reefs. These reefs, which support a quarter of marine species and sustain the lives of hundreds of millions of people, are officially undergoing “widespread dieback” due to ocean warming. The scientists estimate reefs begin collapsing between 1°C and 1.5°C of global heating, with current warming already at 1.4°C. The report, backed by 160 scientists from 23 countries, also cautions that other critical systems, the Amazon, Antarctic ice, and ocean currents, may soon reach tipping points. The urgency for sustainable business practices and emissions cuts continues to grow as scientists discover these irreversible tipping points.

The ambitious plans follow Beijing’s export controls on rare earths and related technologies announced last week. The U.S. relies on critical minerals for defense, and Trump is eager to use $5B for defense department investments in critical minerals supply chains. With these bold investments, the critical question that remains is: where will these minerals come from?

New Zealand targets 24% methane cut from livestock by 2050

New Zealand has announced a strategy to reduce methane emissions from livestock, the sector responsible for nearly half its total greenhouse gases, by up to 24% by 2050. The plan emphasizes research, technology investment, and collaboration with farmers to develop low-emission feed and breeding innovations. Agriculture remains the backbone of New Zealand’s economy, but methane from sheep and cattle has made it one of the world’s highest per-capita emitters. The initiative signals a pragmatic approach to balancing economic stability with global climate commitments, though critics say the voluntary measures may fall short of what’s needed to meet the country’s 1.5°C target.

In related news, the Getting to Zero Coalition and the Global Maritime Forum recently published a new insight brief which highlighted that IMO’s new policy measures are ambitious enough to drive a transition to scalable zero-emission fuels but will ultimately only succeed if they include meaningful rewards and, over time, higher penalties for non-compliance.

The analysis found that e-fuels have the highest potential for shipping to achieve its long-term decarbonization targets. However, early uptake and value chain development are needed if they are to reach commercial viability in time.

Exports of wind turbines were up 41% in value and 28% in volume, with solar panel exports decreasing 22% in value but increasing 24% in volume.

Liquid biofuel exports declined in both value (-18%) and in volume (-7%) terms.

Imports from China

As Eurostat noted, China was ‘by far the largest supplier of solar panels, accounting for 98% of all imports’, however the total value of these imports fell from €19.0 billion in 2023 to €10.9 billion in 2024.

IMO Meeting is Crucial Moment for Shipping Industry to Cut Its Global Climate Pollution

London– As a special meeting of the International Maritime Organization’s Marine Environment Protection Committee (IMO, MEPC/ES.2) opens tomorrow in London, the Clean Shipping Coalition is calling on IMO member states to adopt the IMO’s Net-Zero Framework (NZF) – set to be the first globally binding set of policies to reduce shipping’s climate pollution.

The IMO’s Net-Zero Framework is aimed at reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from ships, in line with its GHG Strategy. The NZF includes a global fuel standard (GFS), requiring ships “to gradually reduce how polluting its ship fuel can be (i.e. how much greenhouse gas is emitted for each unit of energy used, across a fuel’s life cycle)”. It also includes a mechanism for setting prices on the GHG ships emit, to encourage the shipping industry to lower emissions as per the global fuel standard.

“The IMO’s Net-Zero Framework is far from perfect – lacking ambition, proper safeguards against the uptake on unsustainable fuels, and failing to provide the levels of guaranteed finance needed for a just and equitable shipping energy transition – but it is a vital step forward by the IMO”, said Delaine McCullough, President of the Clean Shipping Coalition (CSC). “It’s encouraging to see the shipping industry rally around a real, binding commitment to drastically reduce these dangerous emissions. What has been missing—until now—is a plan that countries could agree on. This agreement provides a lesson for the world that legally-binding climate action is possible—now.”

“During this meeting, IMO Member States must not only adopt the Net-Zero Framework but agree on a realistic and robust plan for fixing the framework’s failings and putting shipping on a truly sustainable path to zero-emission shipping”, said McCullough. “The technology to make ships greener has long existed. This includes measures like reducing vessel speed, adding sails to harness wind power, powering ships through rechargeable batteries and fuel cells where possible, and deploying new zero-emission fuels that are safe for people and the ocean.”

“Pacific Island nations, along with Mexico, have made an important attempt to reframe the commitments in the NZF within a new submission (MEPC ES.2-2-13), which should be unanimously supported, especially because it brings the shipping sector back into alignment with a 1.5 degree pathway and the foundation of a just and equitable transition”, said Andrew Dumbrille, Co-Founder and Director of Equal Routes. “It also reminds IMO members of their commitments under international law and binding relevant treaties including under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Marine Biological Diversity of Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ), and the International Court of Justice (ICJ) Advisory Opinion on the Obligations of States in respect of Climate Change.”

“During this week’s extraordinary MEPC session, IMO Member States face a clear choice”, said Dr Alison Shaw, IMO Manager at Transport & Environment. “A yes vote signals a commitment to implement the Net-Zero Framework, the IMO’s most comprehensive regulation to cut shipping’s greenhouse gas emissions to date. A no vote would cast the sector adrift, wasting years of negotiation and steering it into rougher and rising seas. Yet the framework isn’t perfect – it lacks clear signals to incentivise green e-fuels and wind-propulsion, both essential for meeting IMO climate goals, and safeguards to prevent first-generation biofuels driving deforestation. The IMO must use the implementation guidelines to back scalable, green e-fuels and technologies, not short-term paper fixes. Nevertheless, let’s not throw the baby out with the ballast water. It’s time to vote yes.”

It’s vital that the Net Zero Framework is adopted”, said Anaïs Rios, Senior Shipping Policy Officer, Seas At Risk. “Delaying it doesn’t buy time, it kills investment certainty. Without clear rules, shipowners will lack the incentive to upgrade their fleet and fuel suppliers will stall on zero-emission fuel infrastructure. The entire transition will be slowed down and will keep the door open for transitional fuels to dominate well into the 2030s. It will also sideline proven solutions such as wind propulsion, which can cut fuel bills today while lowering emissions. This is why it is imperative the NZF is adopted and the guidelines reward clean technologies, such as wind propulsion, to give ships financial incentives to meet their decarbonisation targets.”

“The NZF is also only part of the shipping decarbonisation puzzle”, said John Maggs, the Clean Shipping Coalition’s Representative at the IMO. “Equally important, especially in the shorter-term, is the push to improve the energy efficiency of ships. Without a parallel improved IMO Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII) driving a reduction in fuel burn the IMO and shipping will not be able to meet the 2030 and 2040 goals of the 2023 IMO GHG Strategy. The CII is also key to keeping the cost of shipping’s energy transition down and making sure that shipping’s demand for new fuels made with renewable electricity doesn’t adversely impact the decarbonisation of the wider economy.” The revision of the CII resumes at MEPC 84 in April 2026.

“While the NZF falls short of what is needed to tackle shipping emissions, it is essential that IMO member states now adopt the deal in October, work to strengthen it as soon as possible, and resist attempts to dilute its provisions further“, said Jenny Helle, Expert on Decarbonisation of Aviation and Shipping at Carbon Market Watch. “IMO national delegations should, at the very least, significantly accelerate the reduction of GHG intensity emissions mandated by the Z factors by increasing the level of the latter to reach the IMO’s 2030 and 2040 targets. IMO national delegations must significantly speed up the increase in Z factors for Direct Compliance to widen the Tier 1 zone and broaden the share of priced emissions, indirectly raising the effective carbon price on ships. A just and equitable transition (JET) must be a key priority for where the revenue is earmarked, alongside scaling up zero or near-zero (ZNZ) fuels and technologies. This is especially important given that JET is central to the IMO’s 2023 GHG Strategy.”

Emission Control Areas

During MEPC/ES.2, the IMO is set to formally adopt Emission Control Areas in the Northeast Atlantic, meaning that from 2027 ships have to switch to cleaner fuels and install exhaust aftertreatment. Both will reduce the air pollution burden for people and the environment considerably. The measure will also raise the costs to burn fossil fuels, thereby incentivising decarbonisation and efficiency measures, from wind propulsion to e-fuels.

“When adopted, the North Atlantic Emission Control Area will be the biggest of its kind”, said Sönke Diesener, Shipping Expert at NABU. “Clean Shipping Coalition members have been instrumental in pushing this over the decision line in close cooperation with countries. Special thanks go to Portugal for leading the way.”",https://www.ilnautilus.it/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Tackle-Shippings-Outsized.jpg,N,,2025-10-13 08:58:13.311339

At this week’s extraordinary session, leaders will come together in London to discuss the adoption of the IMO’s Net Zero Framework (NZF) that was agreed in April earlier this year.

According to the joint letter, in the view of the signatories, the current framework does not provide sufficiently strong investment signals for e-fuels. The NZF, as currently drafted, and without additional prioritisation for e-fuels in the relevant implementation Guidelines, risks incentivising pay-to-pollute strategies while also stimulating investment in transitional fuels, such as LNG, first-generation biofuels, and blue fuels.

The group of companies, including the likes of European Energy, Liquid Wind, ET Fuels, HIF Global and Zero Waste calls on the IMO to adopt the deal and to include specific incentives for green e-fuels which are currently at a disadvantage to LNG and biofuels

This would leave scalable zero-emission e-fuels under-incentivised from a regulatory standpoint and would delay large-scale deployment of the only long-term zero-emission fuels capable of delivering deep reductions aligned with the IMO 2023 Strategy. Without immediate and unambiguous signals for the production and uptake of e-fuels, the global fleet risks “locking in” short-term fuel pathways that undermine both ambition and cost-effectiveness over time.

E-fuel producers need policy certainty to get green shipping fuels off the ground. Shipping could become a major offtaker for hundreds of projects worldwide, but only under the right rules.

…said Dr. Alison Shaw, IMO Manager at T&E.

Globally, there are an estimated 73 million tonnes per year of green hydrogen production planned for 2030, yet only 13% of these volumes are linked to offtake agreements. In the absence of stronger policy signals, many of these green hydrogen projects may struggle to reach Final Investment Decision (FID) and thus fail to become operational.

This is a challenge shared by all e-fuels as the dynamics seen in green hydrogen mirror those across the wider e-fuels landscape.

If the IMO NZF were to place greater emphasis on green e-fuels uptake, it would provide the necessary demand certainty to unlock investment and ensure the maritime sector’s transition stays on track. Together, the signatories to this letter have projects in Africa, South and North America, Europe, South Asia as well as Oceania.

…the statement highlights.

The NZF is a once-in-a-generation opportunity. By sending clear and durable signals in favour of scalable zero-emission e-fuels, the IMO can ensure that international shipping is not only on track to transition its fuel mix to reduce GHG emissions, but that it does so in a cost-effective and sustainable way.

The company explained at the time that the green lights for the lithium-ion-based solution confirmed the necessary safety and performance requirements for marine equipment as set by both the UK-based LR and France-headquartered BV.

Over the past two years, the Swiss marine technology player, which was founded in 1909 in Yverdon-les-Bains, Switzerland, has inked contracts for numerous electrification projects.

At least two, for instance, were signed in September 2023. One was penned in the middle of that month with Scotland’s Caledonian Maritime Assets Limited (CMAL), entailing the installation of a pair of 1.1 MWh Navius MRS-3 systems onto a hybrid roll-on, roll-off passenger and vehicle ferries (RoPax) duo owned by CMAL.",https://cdn.offshorewind.biz/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/06/16092953/Leclanche-secures-new-ferry-electrification-project-in-Norway.jpg?image-crop-positioner-ts=1750058994,N,,2025-10-13 08:58:27.675091

“Since the 1970s, our society has abandoned the tried and failed approval-based regulations and shifted towards evidence-based regulations.” Shipping, in his view, “remains stuck in the distant past.”","EN Decision director Dr Wei Chen argues IMO’s current approach to sewage regulation needs a fundamental shift towards evidence-based enforcement, warning approval regimes have allowed ’invalid’ sewage treatment plants (STPs) to persist on ships.

He was speaking ahead of his appearance on Riviera’s Greywater and blackwater: improving the compliance gap webinar, which takes place on 30 October between 09:00 and 10:00 GMT.

Dr Chen traces his trajectory from land-based wastewater to two decades in maritime environmental engineering and regulation.

He said the turning point was Alaska’s cruise discharge regime, “Since 2000, state regulations have enforced compliant discharge performance from large cruise ships through independent sampling.”

He describes these as “evidence-based regulations,” adding advanced wastewater treatment systems were developed and optimised “achieving consistent, compliant discharge performance with a proven track record.”

Reflecting on that period, Dr Chen said the contrast with wider shipping remains stark.

“As it turned out, the evidence-based regulations in Alaska are the only ones in the marine world. The rest of the shipping industry is regulated by type-approval regimes that are not supported by effective enforcement of compliant discharges,” he said.

He first confronted this gap between the advanced water treatment systems developed for Alaska and STPs when leading testing and an approval application for a sewage treatment plant under an updated MEPC resolution.

He noted legacy STPs were grandfathered and new STPs tested under lab conditions “performed no better on ships,” with many “discharging virtually raw sewage.”

He said it took courage to state the obvious: elsewhere in society, approval-centred models have largely been replaced by monitoring and enforcement.

“Since the 1970s, our society has abandoned the tried and failed approval-based regulations and shifted towards evidence-based regulations.”

Shipping, in his view, “remains stuck in the distant past.”",https://dvzpv6x5302g1.cloudfront.net/AcuCustom/Sitename/DAM/182/Render_StarSeeker_Alaska_2_1200w1_Main.jpg,N,,2025-10-13 08:58:32.111845

More than 20 green fuel producers signed the letter calling on delegates to “Seize a ‘once-in-a-generation’ opportunity to set shipping on a sustainable pathway”.
According to the green fuel producers the NZF as it is currently drafted incentivises the use of transitional fuels such as LNG and first-generation biofuels, locking in short-term fuel pathways.
“E-fuel producers need policy certainty to get green shipping fuels off the ground.","Green fuel producers have written an open letter to the International Maritime Organization (IMO) secretariat and delegates urging them to adopt the Net Zero Framework (NZF) a “critical policy signal for the energy transition”.

The IMO’s Extraordinary Meeting that will formally adopt the NZF, which was agreed in April this year at the Marine Environment Protection Committee’s 83rd sitting, will be passed insists IMO Secretary General Arsenio Dominguez.

More than 20 green fuel producers signed the letter calling on delegates to “Seize a ‘once-in-a-generation’ opportunity to set shipping on a sustainable pathway”.

“The NZF’s effectiveness now depends on how the implementation Guidelines are designed and what signals policymakers choose to embed within them. In the view of the signatories, the current framework does not provide sufficiently strong investment signals for e-fuels,” said the letter.

According to the green fuel producers the NZF as it is currently drafted incentivises the use of transitional fuels such as LNG and first-generation biofuels, locking in short-term fuel pathways.

“This would leave scalable zero-emission e-fuels under-incentivised from a regulatory standpoint and would delay large-scale deployment of the only long-term zero-emission fuels capable of delivering deep reductions aligned with the IMO 2023 Strategy,” they said.

Dr Alison Shaw, IMO manager at T&E, said in its current form the NZF leaves e-fuels competing with cheaper, “unsustainable” fuels such as fossil gas and first-generation biofuels.

“E-fuel producers need policy certainty to get green shipping fuels off the ground. Shipping could become a major offtaker for hundreds of projects worldwide, but only under the right rules,” said Shaw.

The signatories to the letter include European Energy, Liquid Wind, ET Fuels, HIF Global and Zero Waste and the 26 signatories in total have projects providing much greater emissions savings in Africa, South and North America, Europe, Southeast Asia and Oceania.

Meanwhile, Dominguez, speaking to Seatrade Maritime News on the margins of last week’s Cyprus Maritime Conference reiterated: “There is no need for ratification of the framework under the tacit amendment procedures. So, the NZF will enter into force on 1 April 2027, but if we receive notification from more than the representation of 50% of global tonnage then it could impact the entry into force.”

However, that is not what the IMO is focusing on, when the adoption is agreed IMO is ready to move into action the week after working on the implementation and the enforcement from January 2028, he added.

“This is about taking the next steps next week when we adopt,” insisted Dominguez. “Immediately the week after, we're working on the implementation guidelines, the setting up the fund, discussing how we're going to distribute in order to support the sector, the member states, the industry to decarbonize by 2050.”

The Secretary General said it is important to focus on adoption next week, but added, “This is not the end of the story, “then the next part is the work starts”.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltdcfe6aab5515629e/bltbc8ee354502e1799/68ecd0452073bd7a8df5bc28/Arsenio-Dominguez-speaking-at-Cyprus-Maritime.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-10-13 08:59:13.078757

In 2025 alone, the inclusion of shipping in the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) is expected to add more than $6 billion in compliance costs, according to estimates by emissions analytics firm Siglar Carbon. By the end of this decade, as additional regional and global carbon pricing schemes take hold, that figure could surge past $50 billion annually.

The projected total reflects the combined impact of overlapping measures such as the EU ETS, FuelEU Maritime, UK ETS, and the IMO’s upcoming Greenhouse Gas Fuel Intensity (GFI) regulation, due to start in 2028. Siglar warns that if these frameworks operate simultaneously — and more nations follow Europe’s lead with local emission levies — the global carbon cost for shipping could approach $100 billion a year by 2030.

Analysts at LSEG Research expect European carbon prices to reach $150 per tonne of CO₂ by 2030, significantly raising the cost base for operators reliant on fossil fuels.

The IMO’s GFI scheme will overlay a worldwide carbon compliance mechanism on all international voyages. Early projections suggest it could impose $22 billion in annual costs at launch, increasing to $33 billion by 2030.

A major uncertainty remains: will the IMO’s framework supersede existing regional regimes or add yet another layer of costs? A fragmented system could create uneven competitive pressures, with certain routes and operators facing steeper penalties.

- Sanctions on individual officials

- Additional port fees on ships owned, operated or flagged by countries supporting the Net Zero Framework

- Investigations of ""anti-competitive practices"" and potential blocking of vessels from certain flagged countries, measures which would require the participation of the Federal Maritime Commission

The total includes overlapping measures such as the EU ETS, FuelEU Maritime, UK ETS, and the IMO’s upcoming Greenhouse Gas Fuel Intensity (GFI) measure, set to take effect from 2028.

If all schemes coexist and other countries follow the EU’s lead with local emission taxes, the total annual carbon bill for shipping could climb toward $100bn by 2030, the Norway-based company noted.

Forecasts from LSEG Research project that European carbon prices could reach $150 per tonne of CO₂ by 2030, amplifying the cost burden for operators and charterers still dependent on conventional fuels.

“When carbon is priced, it changes the game — from chartering to ship finance,” Siglar analysts said, noting that emissions now carry a measurable commercial value on every voyage.

The IMO’s GFI will effectively introduce a global carbon layer across all international shipping. Estimates suggest it could generate $22bn in compliance costs when it enters into force in 2028, rising to $33bn two years later.

The open question for regulators and the industry is whether the IMO’s global framework will replace or stack on top of regional schemes. If it becomes another layer rather than a harmonised solution, shipping faces a fragmented, multi-tier carbon regime that could penalise some trades more than others.

For shipowners and operators, carbon pricing has shifted from an environmental metric to a core commercial variable.

Check out our newsletter (below and in my bio) #shipping #imo #trump #netzero","Can the U.S. Sink Shipping’s Historic Climate Treaty? For the first time, the world’s shipping sector is close to agreeing to cut its rising carbon emissions. But the US is threatening signatories and delegates themselves. The IMO Treaty Next week, member nations of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) will vote on a Net-Zero Framework for global shipping. The proposal would set a pathway for ships to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, putting a price on carbon-heavy fuels and funding cleaner technologies and support for developing nations. Shipping is responsible for around 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions, and carries 80% of world trade. Industry leaders and investors have called a global framework essential for creating a level playing field and driving innovation towards decarbonization. U.S. Threats The United States has announced that it “unequivocally rejects” the IMO proposal. In a joint statement, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Energy Secretary Chris Wright, and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned that the plan amounts to an “unsanctioned global tax regime.” They threatened visa restrictions, port bans, and sanctions against countries and diplomats that support it. The administration claims the measure would raise costs for American consumers, energy producers, and shipping companies. My Take Despite the US wave-making, this treaty will get done. Without a global system, the shipping industry faces a confusing patchwork of national rules that would make trade costlier and less efficient. A single international framework provides the clarity and stability that businesses need to invest in cleaner ships and fuels. Climate change is too big an issue to ignore, especially as forecasts for global shipping emissions continue to rise. A carbon price would be economically efficient and incentivize actors to raise their game as well. Want more analysis of global changes, risks, and opportunities?

Labour Party climate spokesperson Deborah Russell said it could impact New Zealand's trading reputation.
'Missed opportunity' - climate scientist University of Canterbury professor of physics David Frame was one of five experts on the government-appointed science panel reviewing on biogenic methane targets.
""I think if they'd been a little more far sighted, they could have put a small price on agricultural methane emissions and then they would have been in a position to say to the rest of the world, we have a price on agricultural methane emissions and you don't.
The government will pass an amendment bill - legislating the new biogenic methane target - before the end of the year.","The coalition has missed an opportunity to price agricultural methane emissions, as it moves to slash the country's biogenic methane target, a climate scientist says.

The government has cut the biogenic methane reduction target to 14 to 24 percent below 2017 levels by 2050. The previous target was a range of 24 to 47 percent.

Climate Change Minister Simon Watts said the lower range would give farmers certainty while keeping the country on track to meet its other climate commitments.

""It is really, really important as a government that we want to provide certainty to our agricultural sector and the adjustment that we're making in terms of changing the methane target to 14 to 24 percent is fair and pragmatic,"" he said

In weighing up a new target, the government had to decide whether to embrace a 'no additional warming' approach - cutting just enough to hold methane's heating effect steady at a fixed point - or hold the line on more ambitious cuts, brought in by the former Labour government.

ACT leader David Seymour hailed the decision as a win for his party, saying it's about time his coalition partners caught up to him on climate policy.

""I voted alone against the entire parliament when these targets were introduced. I'm thrilled seven years later to see a reality check.

""It makes no sense to drive New Zealand farmers out of business so their competitors overseas can serve the same customers with higher emissions. That's the definition of a lose-lose.""

Both Labour and the Green Party have condemned the move, arguing the cut will cost the country in the long term.

Labour Party climate spokesperson Deborah Russell said it could impact New Zealand's trading reputation.

""My concern is not so much the emissions themselves, but the political and economic signals it sends; it says that we're not prepared to do our bit and because of that we could be compromised in terms of our markets.""

Green Party co-leader and climate change spokesperson Chlöe Swarbrick said there was a lot more than just the markets on the line.

""This methane denial betrays farmers who are on the front line of climate-driven extreme weather events that threaten global food production and rural livelihoods.""

'Missed opportunity' - climate scientist

University of Canterbury professor of physics David Frame was one of five experts on the government-appointed science panel reviewing on biogenic methane targets.

He said the old target was far too ambitious, given it was widely accepted the world was about to go ""zooming by"" the 1.5 degree global warming target.

""It was never very realistic, [the former Labour government] plucked that target because it was ambitious but that I don't think it was particularly well thought through.

""Now you're seeing a bunch of other countries and entities who made ambitious pronouncements a few years ago begin to see the writing on the wall.

""It's sad and it's not great but it was always a bit of a mistake to hardwire in legislative targets around 1.5 degree Paris [target], which is the lower end of the Paris Agreement target range, just because it was never very plausible.""

Frame said the new target was more realistic, though he was critical of the government for deciding against pricing agricultural methane emissions, saying decision makers had bowed to the farming lobby.

""I think if they'd been a little more far sighted, they could have put a small price on agricultural methane emissions and then they would have been in a position to say to the rest of the world, we have a price on agricultural methane emissions and you don't.

""That is a form of leadership, actual practical policy leadership, not just grand pronouncements or what about what the world would be like in 2050 which are pretty meaningless.

""It was a missed opportunity and I also think they could have gone some way to assuaging the concerns of people who think this is a retrenchment from climate policy.""

A meteorologist from Environment and Climate Change Canada said the colder temperatures are brought by a sharp cold front coming off a low-pressure system.
“It’s basically bringing in a colder air mass, which has been situated to the north,” said Rob Griffith on Saturday.
While Calgary had its warmest September on record this year, Griffith said it’s normal to start seeing colder temperatures by the middle of October.
“It’s not like it’s winter for good, yet, but it’s kind of the first taste of those temperatures,” Griffith said.","After a mostly mild start to fall, Calgarians can expect colder temperatures over the Thanksgiving weekend, as well as the first snowfall of the season.

The Weather Network is forecasting afternoon highs of zero and -1C on Sunday and Monday, with overnight lows dipping down to -2C and -5C on those two days, respectively.

A mixture of rain and snow was in the forecast for Saturday night .

A meteorologist from Environment and Climate Change Canada said the colder temperatures are brought by a sharp cold front coming off a low-pressure system.

“It’s basically bringing in a colder air mass, which has been situated to the north,” said Rob Griffith on Saturday. “You’ll notice, (Saturday night), strong northerly winds and that’s bringing in that air mass.

“Then there’s precipitation along the front that will start off to rain and should change to snow as temperatures drop, which in Calgary should be around the night, give or take an hour.”

Environment and Climate Change Canada issued snowfall warnings Saturday morning for areas west of Calgary, including Kananaskis, Banff and Lake Louise. Anywhere from five to 20 centimetres of snow is expected to fall this weekend, depending on location.

“Elevation makes a big difference, so higher areas west of Calgary in particular will have some fairly significant accumulation this weekend, but in Calgary itself, we’re not expecting (much),” Griffith said. “That precipitation will start as rain, whereas in the mountain, you’re cooler already just by being higher up, so it takes less to drop to freezing.”

Snow is also expected along other travel routes through the Rockies, including portions of the Trans-Canada Highway, which the federal agency is saying may make travel hazardous.

While Calgary had its warmest September on record this year, Griffith said it’s normal to start seeing colder temperatures by the middle of October.

“Going forward, I would never rule out snow in September in Calgary,” he said. “It’s maybe becoming less likely with climate change but it’s still a possibility.”

For those who haven’t done so already, he said it’s likely time to turn on furnaces and winterize backyards and houses.

“It’s not like it’s winter for good, yet, but it’s kind of the first taste of those temperatures,” Griffith said.

However, he noted temperatures in Calgary are expected to bounce back to the positives by the middle of next week, with a high of 6C forecast for Tuesday and an afternoon high of 12C by next Thursday, according to The Weather Network.

More than 1,000 delegates took part in the international Maritime Cyprus 2025 conference, held in Limassol from October 6 to October 8.","Here are the top business stories in Cyprus from the week starting October 6:

One of the government’s main goals, the qualitative and further strengthening of the Cypriot ship registry, has been achieved, president Nikos Christodoulides said on Sunday evening.

Speaking at a dinner at the presidential palace marking the start of the Maritime Cyprus 2025 conference, he stated that the registry recorded an increase approaching twenty per cent over the past two years.

The president welcomed participants, expressing “great pleasure” at hosting the dinner and highlighting the importance of the biennial event, which was first organised in Cyprus in 1989.

He said that the conference has now been “firmly established as a significant institution both in Cyprus and in international maritime affairs and has been substantially upgraded in recent years, both in quality and scale”.

President Nikos Christodoulides on Monday said that one of the key priorities of the Cypriot Presidency of the EU Council is to ensure the competitiveness of European shipping.

He also spoke about the progress achieved by the Cypriot maritime sector, which has recorded robust growth over the past two years.

During his address at the opening of the Maritime Cyprus 2025 Conference in Limassol, the president said that the event’s title, “Unlocking the Future of Shipping”, reflects both today’s intricate challenges and the enduring resilience of the maritime industry.

He added that his presence at the conference demonstrates the importance his government places on the maritime sector.

Referring to Cypriot shipping, Christodoulides said that “the numbers speak for themselves“, emphasising that Cyprus holds one of the largest fleets in the world and operates across all shipping-related domains.

Cyprus’ shipping sector remains a cornerstone of the national economy, according to the president of the Cyprus Shipping Chamber (CSC) Andreas Neophytou.

Neophytou’s comments were delivered during a reception hosted by the chamber on Sunday, ahead of the Maritime Cyprus 2025 international conference.

An announcement from the chamber said the event brought together more than 800 guests, “underscoring the chamber’s prestige and the respect it commands both locally and internationally”.

Among those attending were ministers, members of parliament, diplomats, senior government officials, representatives of professional organisations, and top executives from the Cypriot and global shipping industry.

In his address, Neophytou welcomed attendees and highlighted the vital role of Cyprus’ shipping industry for the economy and global trade.

A high-level ministerial panel bringing together maritime leaders from Cyprus, Greece, Bahrain, and Qatar took place on Monday, as part of the Maritime Cyprus 2025 Conference.

The first panel discussion, “Winds of Change: Ministers at the Helm of Maritime Transformation,” of the Maritime Cyprus 2025 Conference, took place earlier today.

Ministers of Cyprus, Greece, the State of Qatar and the Kingdom of Bahrain responsible for maritime affairs shared valuable insights regarding the challenges that global shipping is facing.

They all agreed that by aligning policies regionally and deepening collaboration through multilateral platforms like the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), states can build a more resilient, fair, and sustainable maritime future.

The panel was moderated by Souzana Psara, business and finance reporter at the Cyprus Mail.

Participants included Shipping Deputy Minister of Cyprus Marina Hadjimanolis, Minister of Maritime Affairs and Insular Policy of Greece Vasilis Kikilias, Minister of Transportation and Telecommunications of Bahrain Sheikh Abdullah bin Ahmed Al Khalifa, and Minister of Transport of Qatar Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulla bin Mohammed Al Thani.

Cyprus is set to take centre stage in shaping Europe’s future transport, shipping and tourism policies during its upcoming Presidency of the Council of the European Union, according to European Commissioner for Sustainable Transport and Tourism Apostolos Tzitzikostas.

Addressing the Maritime Cyprus 2025 conference in Limassol, he said the Cypriot Presidency “will be decisive for Europe and for transport policy,” noting that as a major maritime nation, Cyprus will help define the new EU Maritime Industrial Strategy, the EU Port Strategy and the Military Mobility Package.

He also revealed that the EU’s first-ever European Strategy for Tourism is expected “by Easter next year,” adding that Cyprus will play a key role in its development.

On the sidelines of the conference, Shipping Deputy Minister Marina Hadjimanolis met with the commissioner to discuss the ministry’s priorities ahead of the Presidency in 2026 and in light of the forthcoming European Industrial Maritime Strategy.

Cyprus, a country with more than six decades of maritime tradition, reaffirmed its role as a global shipping leader during the opening of the Maritime Cyprus 2025 Conference in Limassol on Monday.

Addressing delegates, Shipping Deputy Minister Marina Hadjimanolis welcomed ministers, shipowners and industry figures from around the world, saying it was “a great pleasure to welcome you all to Limassol, the capital of shipping, for Maritime Cyprus Conference 2025.”

She noted that the first Maritime Cyprus Conference was held in 1989, creating “a platform for global dialogue that has endured for decades.”

Today, she said, “the heart of international shipping beats strongly in Cyprus,” describing the event as “a celebration of the spirit, resilience, and enduring excellence of shipping.”

The minister also extended a warm welcome to her counterparts from India, Qatar, Bahrain, Greece, Poland and Malta, saying their presence “sends the strongest message, that shipping is the force that shapes the world, whether it’s ideas, products or goods, nothing changes until it moves.”

The Research and Innovation Foundation (RIF) represented Cyprus at the Science and Technology for Society (STS) Forum 2025, held in Kyoto, Japan, on October 5–6, 2025.

According to an announcement released on Tuesday, chief scientist Demetris Skourides and RIF director general Theodoros Loukaidis held a series of high-level meetings with leading international figures in research and innovation.

During the forum, they met with Marcia McNutt, president of the US National Academy of Sciences, to discuss the need to redesign research evaluation systems.

The discussion focused on better use of knowledge and creating career opportunities for young researchers.

Paphos has emerged as one of Cyprus’ most dynamic property markets in the first half of 2025, according to a report released on Tuesday by Landbank Analytics.

The findings show that Paphos recorded a high number of apartment sales, while resale houses in the district remained among the most expensive on the island.

Specifically, a total of 203 apartment transactions were recorded in Paphos during the first six months of 2025, more than twice the number of house sales.

In addition, the average resale apartment price stood at €129,774, the lowest in Cyprus, reflecting the district’s continued appeal to local and foreign buyers seeking affordable yet attractive options.

Cyprus recorded one of the highest proportions of employees working long hours in the European Union during the second quarter of 2025, according to figures from Eurostat.

The figures reveal that 16.6 per cent of employed Cypriots aged 20 to 64 worked more than 45 hours per week in their main and second jobs combined.

This places Cyprus second only to Greece, which topped the list at 20.9 per cent, while Malta followed with 14.6 per cent.

At the other end of the scale, the lowest proportions of long-hour workers were found in Bulgaria, Latvia, and Romania, where the rates stood at 2.5 per cent, 4.1 per cent, and 5.9 per cent respectively.

Businesses are being urged to step up their role in the green transition while maintaining competitiveness, President Nikos Christodoulides told an event in Nicosia on Monday evening.

Addressing the presentation of the Photos Photiades Group’s new sustainability initiative ‘Epilogi’, he said the programme tackles one of today’s biggest challenges, protecting the environment in a “structured, practical and specific way.”

“Industry”, he said, “remains a key pillar of Cyprus’s economy but also one with significant energy needs.”

“However, through energy-efficient technologies, management systems and renewable energy, companies can reduce both their consumption and environmental footprint, our minimum obligation to future generations, while also strengthening their long-term competitiveness,” he added.

Christodoulides also said that the government is promoting investments in renewable energy, smart systems and innovative technologies aimed at cutting costs and improving industrial resilience.

Deputy Tourism Minister Kostas Koumis met with European Commissioner for Sustainable Transport and Tourism Apostolos Tzitzikostas this week, in order to discuss the European tourism strategy currently under development.

According to a statement by the Deputy Ministry, the meeting took place as part of the commissioner’s visit to Cyprus and focused on the sector’s importance to the Cypriot economy, as well as its performance from 2019 to the present.

The discussion acknowledged that tourism, in Cyprus as elsewhere, has been affected by both the pandemic and geopolitical tensions.

According to the announcement, the main topic of discussion was the European Tourism Strategy, an initiative of Commissioner Tzitzikostas, which is expected to be presented in 2026 following consultations with all stakeholders.

The process is set to culminate during the Cyprus Presidency of the Council of the EU.

Cyprus and Qatar have signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to strengthen cooperation in maritime affairs.

The memorandum covers areas such as education, infrastructure, environmental protection, as well as the green transition of shipping.

The agreement was signed on Tuesday by Deputy Minister of Shipping Marina Hadjimanolis and Qatar’s Minister of Transport, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulla bin Mohammed Al Thani, on the sidelines of the Maritime Cyprus 2025 Conference in Limassol.

The signing followed a meeting between the two delegations, building on discussions held during Hadjimanolis’ official visit to Doha a few months earlier.

Hadjimanolis said she was pleased to welcome the Qatari minister to Cyprus, describing his presence as “a continuation of my visit to Doha, where we discussed the signing of this memorandum”.

Entrepreneur and philanthropist Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou awarded a total of €200,000 to three young Cypriot businesses during the 2025 Stelios Awards for Young Entrepreneurs, held at the Stelios Philanthropic Foundation headquarters in Nicosia.

The awards, now in their third consecutive year, aim to recognise innovation and support the growth of youth entrepreneurship in Cyprus.

The first prize of €100,000 was presented to George Chrysostomides for his Shopify website creation company, “Shrine”.

The second prize of €60,000 went to Chrystallena Poulli for her plant-based cosmetics company, “CP Herbalist”.

The third prize of €40,000 was awarded to Harout Chouldjian and Panayiotis Frantzesko for their international online shapewear clothing company, “Luxmery”.

The second day of the Maritime Cyprus 2025 Conference, held on Tuesday, brought together international industry leaders for discussions on insurance, ownership, and chartering trends under the theme “Unlocking the Future of Shipping.”

Throughout the day, speakers and delegates examined how cooperation, technology, and long-term thinking will shape the sector’s evolution amid continued regulatory, geopolitical, and economic pressures.

The day began with the panel “P&I Market: Latest Developments and Update about the Renewal Season 2026,” moderated by Filippo Fabbri, CEO at Lockton P.L. Ferrari, and featuring Paul Jennings, Managing Director at NorthStandard, Andrew Taylor, CEO at UK P&I Club, Jonathan Andrews, CEO at Steamship Mutual, and Rolf Thore Roppestad, CEO at Gard AS.

During the discussion, speakers focused on the resilience of the protection and indemnity market and the challenges shaping the 2026 renewal season.

The Bank of Cyprus on Wednesday announced the full implementation of instant payments in Cyprus, effective October 9, 2025.

This will allow customers to send and receive payments from any bank within Cyprus or the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) in a matter of seconds.

According to the bank’s announcement, customers will now be able to make and receive instant payments from any Cypriot or SEPA-zone bank, significantly reducing transaction times compared with traditional transfers.

The processing time for a payment from the payer’s account to the recipient’s account will be reduced to just 10 seconds, regardless of the country from which the payment originates.

By contrast, the current processing time for conventional bank transfers can take one to two business days.

The Cyprus hospitality venues association (Pasika) has expressed its strong opposition to a new draft law proposed by the Deputy Ministry of Tourism, warning that it will not hesitate to take strong measures if the bill is enacted.

The bill, titled “The Establishment and Operation of Catering and Entertainment Venues Law of 2025”, was approved by the Cabinet earlier this week.

According to the Deputy Ministry, the new legislation is designed to replace the existing framework governing the operation of recreation and entertainment centres, introducing simplified procedures, modernised regulations, and revised operating hours.

Deputy Minister of Tourism Kostas Koumis said that the law aims to modernise legislative provisions, support entrepreneurship, and promote service quality in the hospitality sector.

The European Union is ready to support the transformation of shipping into an industry focused on cleaner fuels, energy efficiency and innovation, European Commissioner for Fisheries and Oceans Costas Kadis, said on Wednesday.

Kadis, who addressed the Maritime Cyprus 2025 conference in Limassol, highlighted Cyprus’ important role in shaping the future of international shipping, both through the International Maritime Organisation and the EU, but also beyond these two bodies.

He added that this year’s conference theme, ‘Unlocking the Future of Shipping’, aligns closely with the pressing challenges currently facing the international maritime sector.

Saying that shipping is undergoing profound transformation, he stressed that “the European Union is ready to support this transition with both ambition and accountability”, and underlined that “the European Ocean Pact represents a flagship initiative of his portfolio”.

The Maritime Cyprus 2025 Conference entered its third and final day on Wednesday, concluding three days of dynamic discussion under the central theme “Unlocking the Future of Shipping.”

Building on the momentum of previous sessions, the final day focused on the future of maritime safety, the transition toward climate resilience, and the technologies and partnerships that will shape the next decade of global shipping.

The day opened with an address by European Commissioner for Fisheries and Oceans, Costas Kadis, who outlined the European Union’s commitment to supporting shipping’s green and digital transitions.

He highlighted Cyprus’ leadership as a maritime services hub and its close alignment with the EU’s vision for sustainable ocean governance under the European Ocean Pact.

According to the commissioner, a European Maritime Industrial Strategy, an EU Port Strategy and a Strategy for Coastal and Island Communities are all in the pipeline, each designed to strengthen competitiveness, modernise infrastructure and accelerate investment in renewable fuels and technology.

Cyprus’ Ministry of Labour will roll out or announce 14 employment support grant schemes by the end of 2025, with a combined budget of €88.7 million.

The schemes form part of the ministry’s broader employment strategy for 2026–2028, which focuses on tackling unemployment and helping businesses hire from groups facing barriers to work.

According to the ministry, the plans are co-financed by national resources, the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+), and the Recovery and Resilience Plan, while the Department of Labour is responsible for their design, implementation and monitoring.

Within the framework of the Thaleia 2021–2027 Operational Programme, all 14 schemes are expected to be either completed or launched by the end of next year.

In September, the government moved ahead with four new incentive schemes aimed at helping those who face greater difficulties finding a job.

Cypriot MEP Michalis Hadjipantelas’ report on simplifying the EU tax was debated in the European Parliament plenary on Wednesday, aiming to make the bloc’s tax system more competitive without easing the fight against tax avoidance, evasion and fraud.

The report, according to Politis, includes proposals to reduce administrative barriers, simplify tax compliance, and cut compliance costs, which for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are estimated to reach about 30 per cent of taxes paid.

At the same time, the measures are expected to help governments improve tax collection and curb avoidance and evasion.

It also integrates key proposals from organised bodies in Cyprus, reinforcing the country’s presence and positions at the European level.

Hadjipantelas said in his address to the plenary that the EU “needs a simple tax framework, modern and functional, that will encourage entrepreneurship and small and medium-sized enterprises, attract investment and support social cohesion.”

Cyprus is pushing ahead with a new model of governance that puts people, trust and innovation at its core, Deputy Minister to the President Irene Piki said on Thursday, opening the Digital Agenda Cyprus Summit 2025 in Nicosia.

She said the government is modernising institutions, simplifying procedures and embedding accountability in daily decision-making, in an effort to make governance more efficient and ensure citizens feel that change is real.

“When people hear the phrase ‘digital transformation’, they often think of technology, algorithms and artificial intelligence,” she said, noting that, “for her, it is about people”.

She cited several examples, including “a citizen trying to renew a permit, a small business owner applying for a licence, or a parent enrolling their child in school online”.

These, she explained, are signs of a country that is “efficient, transparent, fair and results-oriented”.

Cypriot telecoms provider Cyta has won the top European award for its strategic fibre network rollout that brings high-speed internet to every corner of Cyprus.

The telecommunications authority received first place in the category “Champions in addressing the digital divide in rural and remote areas” at the European Digital Connectivity Awards 2025, held in Brussels on October 7, 2025.

“The award recognised Cyta’s nationwide fibre-optic network development, a strategic project that only Cyta is implementing on an island-wide scale to ensure equal access for all citizens to Gigabit speeds, from urban centres to the most remote communities,” the company said in an announcement.

“Through this project, local communities are being empowered, businesses strengthened, and access facilitated to essential services such as remote education, teleworking and telemedicine,” it added.

Eurobank reaffirmed its commitment to supporting Cyprus’ new generation of entrepreneurs, standing once again beside the country’s emerging business leaders at the eighth annual “Ge’ neo Epicheirein” Young Entrepreneurship Awards 2025, held on October 8, 2025, at the Presidential Palace.

The awards, organised by the Cyprus Chamber of Commerce and Industry (Keve) and Greek magazine Thessalonikis Dromena, were held under the auspices of the Ministry of Energy, Commerce and Industry, with the support of Eurobank Ltd, the Youth Board of Cyprus, Coneq, and the Association of Cypriot Cartoonists.

The long-established awards aim to recognise and reward young entrepreneurs under 40 years old, highlighting their essential role in driving innovation, extroversion, and economic growth in Cyprus.

Eurobank’s General Manager of Corporate Banking, Nicolas Panayi, congratulated the winners and organisers, describing the event as a celebration of courage, creativity, and innovation.

Seventy-four per cent of shipping companies have already aligned or plan to align with the International Maritime Organisation’s (IMO) net-zero emissions targets, according to preliminary findings presented at the Maritime Cyprus 2025 conference.

Biofuels have emerged as the dominant choice for decarbonisation, with 62 per cent of companies adopting them as part of their transition strategy.

Meanwhile, interest in green hydrogen and ammonia is also growing, with 25 per cent and 19 per cent of respondents respectively identifying them as future alternative fuels.

The findings were presented by Michalis Ierides, secretary-general of the Cyprus Marine Environment Protection Association (CYMEPA), as part of the ongoing international five-year project Metavasea.

The Association of Cyprus Banks (ACB) on Thursday announced that Panicos Nicolaou, chief executive officer at the Bank of Cyprus, has been appointed as its new president following the most recent meeting of board of directors.

Demetris Shacallis, chief financial officer at Eurobank, has been appointed vice-president.

According to the association’s statutes, both the president and vice-president will serve a two-year term.

The change in leadership follows the departure of former president Aristidis Bourakis, who stepped down after taking on new professional responsibilities.

In its statement, the Association of Cyprus Banks thanked Bourakis for his contribution and wished him “every success in his future endeavours”.

A new survey by Zubr Capital has revealed that the majority of relocated tech founders in Europe feel shut out of local startup ecosystems, describing them as “in a bubble” and often lacking meaningful access to capital and quality support.

The findings, published in September 2025, stem from the Relocated Tech Survey, which collected insights from over 100 participants, primarily startup founders, along with investors and senior executives.

Respondents were drawn from major relocation hubs across Europe, with Poland and Cyprus among the most represented, offering what Zubr Capital described as a rare dual founder–investor perspective on how well Europe integrates incoming entrepreneurial talent.

According to the survey, 82 per cent of relocated founders said that local ecosystems are “in a bubble”, while 51 per cent considered this situation critical.

The Cyprus Association of Large Investment Projects has backed a bill to establish a national mechanism for the control of foreign direct investments (FDI), saying it will bolster the credibility of the state and the economy without deterring foreign investors.

Covering key sectors such as energy, financial services and defence, the bill aligns with Cyprus’ wider strategy to attract international capital for major projects that support long-term growth.

The association said that “the need for a formal control framework emerged after a series of large-scale acquisitions in public utilities, which revealed the risk of strategic infrastructure being transferred to investors from third countries”.

“Given the small size of the Cypriot economy, such developments could affect critical sectors such as banking and port operations,” the association added.

A bill submitted to parliament by the Deputy Ministry of Tourism seeks to modernise the legal framework governing catering and entertainment venues, aiming to boost competitiveness and simplify outdated procedures in Cyprus’ hospitality sector.

According to the ministry’s introductory report, the proposed law addresses long-standing gaps and weaknesses in the existing system, with a view to strengthening entrepreneurship, public safety and the overall quality of the tourism product.

It abolishes what the ministry described as “burdensome and anachronistic provisions” that hinder business development, replacing them with a more flexible and transparent structure.

Under the new framework, seven key changes are proposed. These include scrapping strict building criteria and the previous categorisation of recreation centres by class, as well as ending the requirement for operators to submit price lists for approval.

More than 1,000 delegates took part in the international Maritime Cyprus 2025 conference, held in Limassol from October 6 to October 8.

The conference focused on how to unlock the future of shipping, exploring topics such as navigating global disruptions, the P&I market, decarbonisation and climate resilience, technological impacts on seafarers, and funding strategies for the next era of shipping.

Moreover, this year’s event, supported by Eurobank as a platinum sponsor, provided a vital platform for dialogue on the challenges, risks, and opportunities shaping the new era of global shipping.

“Established in 1989, the conference once again highlighted Cyprus’ role as an international maritime, energy, and investment centre, hosting senior executives, officials, and leaders from across the global shipping industry,” Eurobank said in a statement released on Friday.

Neocleous Tower is a groundbreaking commercial development in central Limassol inviting corporations to discover the future of upscale workplace excellence. Redefining the work lifestyle paradigm, the tower is also raising the benchmark for sustainable real estate, offering an eco-conscious, tech-driven and people-centric work environment that fosters excellence, collaboration and well-being.

One of the central themes of the recently-concluded Cyprus–Greece Business and Investment Forum was that the two countries should pursue stronger collaborations, partnerships, and joint ventures to bolster their economies and expand into neighbouring markets.

The event, which took place in Athens, attracted broad participation from both countries’ business communities.

“The event underscored the need for closer cooperation in sectors such as investment, technology, innovation, and women’s entrepreneurship, highlighting their potential to drive mutual economic growth,” the organisers said in a statemenet released on Friday.

Speaking at the forum, Cyprus’ Minister of Energy, Commerce and Industry, George Papanastasiou, and Greece’s Deputy Minister of Development, Stavros Kalafatis, emphasised that “businesses in both countries have the capacity, infrastructure, and willingness to enhance their cooperation and strengthen economic prospects”.

The Cyprus Shipping Chamber (CSC) expressed its strong support for a joint statement by seven leading international maritime organisations urging governments to adopt the ‘Net-Zero Framework’ (NZF).

The proposal is set to be discussed at next week’s Extraordinary Session of the International Maritime Organisation’s (IMO) Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC), which will take place from October 14 to 17, 2025.

The statement, endorsed by the International Chamber of Shipping (ICS), the European Community Shipowners’ Associations (ECSA), the Asian Shipowners’ Association (ASA), the International Association of Ports and Harbors (IAPH), the International Bunker Industry Association (IBIA), the International Transport Workers’ Federation (ITF) and the World Shipping Council (WSC), calls for the NZF to be adopted as a single, global framework to drive the industry’s transition to zero emissions.

The storm will strengthen as it tracks offshore of the Carolinas later today. Winds will increase along the coast, especially around the Outer Banks of North Carolina. The most significant impacts of the system look to begin tomorrow in the Northeast, however. Strong winds from the east and northeast will impact the coast from the Delmarva Peninsula, along the Jersey Shore, Long Island, and into coastal New England.

Winds will blow hard Sunday into Monday, at least. Gusts of 50 to 60 mph are forecast at the coast and up to 30 mph inland. Tides at the beaches and in bays, waterways, and sounds will run a few feet above normal with powerful waves crashing onto beaches, causing high water and beach erosion along most of the eastern seaboard.

The National Weather Service has issued a variety of coastal flood alerts from Florida to New England. If you're near the water, beware of the threat to your neighborhood. And remember, the flooding will be saltwater, which is terrible for your car if you drive through it.

Travel may be disrupted Sunday and Monday in the tri-state area around New York City and in Boston. Check with your airline before you go.

A swath of heavy rain is forecast along the coast, especially from Cape Hatteras north to New England. The land is quite dry, however, which will limit flooding. But in many areas, drainage runs into waterways that might be elevated by the extra-high tides, so local freshwater flooding is possible.

Stay alert to changing conditions along the coast and west to the I-95 corridor until the storm moves away on Tuesday.

Jerry is still disorganized, and the National Hurricane Center is not expecting it to pull itself together to become a hurricane before it gets absorbed into a cold front in a few days. The storm's moisture tail is still impacting the northeast Caribbean with periods of very heavy rain. That will slowly let up as Jerry swings into the central Atlantic, bypassing Bermuda.

An unusually robust tropical disturbance for this time of year has moved off Africa. The National Hurricane Center has its odds of development in the low range for now. In any case, it's forecast to turn north into the open Atlantic.

Interestingly, some computer forecasts show yet another African disturbance moving into the Atlantic next week. We'll watch for that.

These fronts and sharp dips in the jet stream create hostile conditions across the Gulf, Florida, and the Bahamas, which will keep us free from tropical threats for at least the next week or two. Hurricane season goes on elsewhere, however, so we'll have to watch to be sure that an opening doesn't develop for something to move north from the Caribbean.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/b3CS1zy_nbcGaSwTAAL2zg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/fox_weather_articles_483/37bcd9bb6178ad94e89e305a7eb67b8d,N,,2025-10-11 19:56:16.642926

Taking Action To Defend America From UN's First Global Carbon Tax - International Maritime Organization's (IMO) Net-Zero Framework (NZF)

Joint Statement by Secretary of State Rubio, Secretary of Energy Wright, and Secretary of Transportation Duffy

President Trump has made it clear that the United States will not accept any international environmental agreement that unduly or unfairly burdens the United States or harms the interests of the American people. Next week, members of the IMO will vote on the adoption of a so-called NZF aimed at reducing global carbon dioxide gas emissions from the international shipping sector. This will be the first time that a UN organization levies a global carbon tax on the world.

The Administration unequivocally rejects this proposal before the IMO and will not tolerate any action that increases costs for our citizens, energy providers, shipping companies and their customers, or tourists. The economic impacts from this measure could be disastrous, with some estimates forecasting global shipping costs increasing as much as 10% or more. We ask you to join us in rejecting adoption of the NZF at the October meeting and to work together on our collective economic and energy security.

The NZF proposal poses significant risks to the global economy and subjects not just Americans, but all IMO member states to an unsanctioned global tax regime that levies punitive and regressive financial penalties, which could be avoided. The United States is considering the following actions against nations that support this global carbon tax on American consumers:

Pursuing investigations and considering potential regulations to combat anti-competitive practices from certain flagged countries and potential blocking vessels registered in those countries from U.S. ports;

Imposing visa restrictions including an increase in fees and processing, mandatory re-interview requirements and/or revisions of quotas for C-1/D maritime crew member visas;

Imposing commercial penalties stemming from U.S. government contracts including new commercial ships, liquified natural gas terminals and infrastructure, and/or other financial penalties on ships flagged under nations in favor of the NZF;

Imposing additional port fees on ships owned, operated, or flagged by countries supporting the framework; and

Evaluating sanctions on officials sponsoring activist-driven climate policies that would burden American consumers, among other measures under consideration.

The United States will be moving to levy these remedies against nations that sponsor this European-led neocolonial export of global climate regulations. We will fight hard to protect our economic interests by imposing costs on countries if they support the NZF. Our fellow IMO members should be on notice.

The US government, however, slammed the proposal, calling it “a global carbon tax that would harm economic growth and penalize developing nations.”

Since retaking office in January, President Donald Trump has rolled back several climate initiatives, dismissing climate change as a “hoax” and promoting fossil fuel expansion through deregulation.

Rubio, Energy Secretary Chris Wright, and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy reiterated that the Trump administration “categorically rejects” the NZF proposal and will resist any attempt to impose what it considers “globalist economic controls” through the UN framework.

This recognition marks a significant step towards creating an integrated hydrogen ecosystem and advancing India’s transition towards clean energy.

The National Green Hydrogen Mission, launched by the Government of India, aims to position the country as a global hub for the production, utilisation, and export of green hydrogen and its derivatives. The Mission promotes the development of large-scale hydrogen hubs to serve as focal points for production and consumption, thereby facilitating the establishment of a sustainable and competitive hydrogen economy.

Welcoming the development, the Union Minister of Ports, Shipping & Waterways (MoPSW), Sarbananda Sonowal said, “This recognition marks a defining moment in India’s maritime journey as we transition to become a modern, capable and leader in the global maritime segment. Under the visionary leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi ji, we are working towards building an ecosystem of sustainable development that will power India towards realising the vision of becoming net zero by 2070. Ports are an important node in this transition. As Green Hydrogen hubs, our ports will act as catalysts of clean energy innovation. As a maritime leader, India’s ports will not only empower their own country but also leverage its strategic positions along the eastern and western trade routes to drive the region towards sustainable logistics.”

Recognising the logistical and technical challenges associated with long-distance hydrogen transport, the Mission adopts a cluster-based development model. This approach enhances early-stage project viability, enables infrastructure convergence, and helps achieve economies of scale in identified regions.

The revised scheme guidelines for setting up Hydrogen Valley Innovation Clusters (HVIC) and Green Hydrogen Hubs, issued on 27th June 2025, provide the framework for identifying and supporting potential regions capable of large-scale hydrogen activity. Under Component B2 of these guidelines, MNRE may recognise locations as Green Hydrogen Hubs without direct financial assistance, thereby facilitating access to incentives and benefits available under other central or state government schemes.

In accordance with these provisions, the competent authority has approved the recognition of Deendayal, V.O. Chidambaranar, and Paradip Port areas as Green Hydrogen Hubs. Projects established within these designated zones will be eligible for benefits available under other relevant schemes and policies of the Central and State Governments, including those linked to the National Green Hydrogen Mission.

The recognition of these ports is expected to catalyse industrial participation, attract green investments, and promote innovation in clean fuel technologies, supporting India’s broader vision of achieving energy self-reliance and net-zero emissions by 2070.

The United States has threatened to use visa restrictions and sanctions to hit back against nations that vote in favor of a plan put forward by an UN agency to reduce global-warming greenhouse gas emissions from sea shipping.

United Nations (UN) members are scheduled to vote next week on the International Maritime Organization's Net-Zero Framework proposal to reduce global carbon dioxide gas emissions from the international shipping sector, which handles around 80% of world trade and accounts for close to 3% of global greenhouse gases.

Large container carriers, under pressure from investors to fight climate change, generally agree that a global regulatory framework is crucial to speeding up decarbonisation. Still, some of the world’s biggest oil tanker companies said they had ‘grave concerns’ about the proposal.

“The Administration unequivocally rejects this proposal before the IMO and will not tolerate any action that increases costs for our citizens, energy providers, shipping companies and their customers, or tourists,” US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, US Energy Secretary Chris Wright and US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a joint statement.

“The proposal poses significant risks to the global economy and subjects not just Americans, but all IMO member states to an unsanctioned global tax regime that levies punitive and regressive financial penalties,” they said.

Without global regulation, the maritime industry would face a patchwork of regulations and increasing costs without effectively curbing climate-warming greenhouse gas emissions, supporters of the IMO proposal have said.

The US is considering retaliation against UN countries that support the plan, the US officials said in Friday's statement.

That includes potentially blocking vessels flagged in those nations from US ports, imposing visa restrictions and fees, and slapping sanctions on officials “sponsoring activist-driven climate policies”.

In a joint statement, they described it as an “unsanctioned global tax regime” that could raise shipping and energy costs, harming both the American economy and international trade. The officials warned that any country endorsing the plan could face penalties such as blocked port access for vessels, higher fees, and targeted sanctions against policymakers “sponsoring activist-driven climate policies.”

While environmental advocates and major shipping companies argue that unified global standards are essential to accelerate decarbonization and prevent fragmented regulations, some oil tanker operators have voiced “grave concerns” over potential financial burdens.

Striking asperitas formations were among the clouds spotted.

The Met Office describes them as a new and rare cloud type that look like ""rippling ocean waves in the sky"".

It also said why these clouds form remains a mystery, but it is thought their appearance is associated with thunderstorms.

The Met Office added: ""What is clear, however, is that atmospheric conditions must be unstable to form a wavy cloud base like that seen with asperitas.""

BBC Weather Watcher Martainn pictured asperitas from Arnisdale, in the west Highlands, on Monday evening.

Similar formations were seen from Lochcarron, also in the Highlands.

In parts of north east Scotland, there were double rainbows and some dramatic sunsets.

Karen formed late the night of Oct. 9 and by morning was located about 570 miles north-northwest of the Azores off of Portugal. As of Oct. 10, there were no threats to land predicted from Karen, which was moving 9 mph to the northeast with wind speeds of 40 mph.

The subtropical storm won't make it far before fizzling out into a post-tropical low by Oct. 11, the National Hurricane Center said. It will pick up a little in speed but not strength in the meantime, forecasters said.

Tropical Storm Jerry is meanwhile bringing heavy rain to the Caribbean island of Barbuda, along with the Leeward and Virgin islands, risking flash flooding, the hurricane center said. Puerto Rico could also see between 2 and 4 inches with localized amounts up to 6 inches.

Jerry was struggling to organize into a hurricane as forecasters previously predicted might happen toward the end of the week. Early on Oct. 10 it was passing to the north of the Leeward Islands and was located about 80 miles away, with wind speeds up to 50 mph.

As the final stretch of the 2025 Atlantic season is underway, no hurricanes have made landfall in the U.S., though four have formed so far. The Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June 1 and will last through the end of November. Experts say it's wise to stay prepared for potential impacts, as more hurricanes or strong storms could still form before then.

A grim reminder: October is still hurricane season. These were the most destructive October storms in U.S. history

Tropical Storm Jerry not expected to become a hurricane

Jerry is no longer expected to become a hurricane, which would happen if it reached wind speeds of at least 74 mph. Jerry could still see some strengthening, but some forecast models suggest it won't strengthen further at all and there's some indication it will only weaken, forecasters said.

Despite not forming into a hurricane, Jerry is still bringing potentially dangerous rainfall and flash flooding risk to the Leeward and Virgin islands. Dangerous surf conditions are also extending out from the tropical storm.

Jerry is moving toward the northwest and is expected to make a northward turn later on Oct. 10, pulling away from the islands. Its center should move well to the southeast of Bermuda on Oct. 12. By early next week, Jerry is likely to turn more northeastward and eastward, forecasters said.

US faces dual storm threats this weekend

On the Atlantic Coast, a developing nor'easter on the horizon for the weekend is forecast to wreak havoc on a stretch from the Southeast to the Mid-Atlantic, likely reaching the Northeast. Coastal flooding and high surf, compounded by seasonal high tides, with dangerous rip currents and gusty winds are all possible from the storm, the National Weather Service said.

Tropical moisture from Hurricane Priscilla in the Pacific is meanwhile expected to bring heavy rainfall and potential flash flooding in the Southwest. Burn scars are particularly vulnerable to flooding in the region, forecasters said.

The shipping industry, which contributes nearly 3% to the world's greenhouse gases, is under pressure to adopt a unified regulatory framework, though large oil tanker companies have voiced significant reservations.

In a joint statement on Friday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Energy Secretary Chris Wright, and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy expressed strong opposition to the proposal, deeming it a threat to the global economy by imposing a 'regressive financial regime' that could negatively impact American citizens and U.S. businesses. They firmly stated that the administration will not support any policy that adds to the financial burden of energy providers, shipping companies, or consumers.

Supporters of the IMO's initiative argue that without a comprehensive global regulation, the industry will deal with a fragmented regulatory landscape that increases costs while failing to curb emissions effectively. Nevertheless, U.S. officials have hinted at possible retaliatory measures against supporting nations, including banning their ships from U.S. ports, imposing fee increases, and instituting sanctions on officials promoting the IMO's climate policies.

Nearly 80% of the cruise trips made in Alaska last year burned heavy fuel oil through open-loop or hybrid systems.
Cruise ships that burn heavy fuel oil are equipped to switch between fuel types.","Some Alaskans are fired up about water pollution from heavy fuel oil burned on large cruise ships. At a panel discussion in Juneau on Wednesday, members of tribes and conservation organizations said there’s a solution: using cleaner fuel.

Heavy fuel oil is the stuff from the bottom of the barrel — the waste product at the end of the oil refining process. It’s cheaper than distillate fuels and is used widely by most of the large cruise ships that travel along Alaska’s coastline every year.

When it’s burned, heavy fuel oil exhaust releases sulfur oxide into the air, which can cause heart and lung disease and lead to acid rain. In 2020, the International Maritime Organization, or IMO, required ships that burn heavy fuel oil to use scrubbers, which filter the exhaust through seawater.

Aaron Brakel is a clean water campaigner at the Southeast Alaska Conservation Council, which organized the panel. He said scrubbers didn’t solve the pollution problem — they just moved it into the ocean.

“They spray the water, transferring pollutants from the air into the water from the exhaust,” he said. “Most of the scrubbers worldwide, most of the ones here in Alaska, are open-loop systems.”

That means they pump seawater infused with toxic exhaust back into the ocean instead of storing it and disposing of it at an onshore facility.

Nearly 80% of the cruise trips made in Alaska last year burned heavy fuel oil through open-loop or hybrid systems. Hybrid scrubbers can switch between dumping the effluent or storing it, depending on discharge regulations in the waters the ship is passing through.

Brakel probed into U.S. Environmental Protection Agency records and found that between 2023 and 2024, 17 ships using open-loop scrubber systems reported more than 700 water quality violations off the coast of Alaska, as Alaska Public Media reported last month. But the data doesn’t show exactly where the violations happened.

Kay Brown is the Arctic policy director at Pacific Environment, an advocacy nonprofit. Last year, she and her colleagues published a literature review of studies around the world on the negative effects of scrubbers.

“The big takeaway here is that scrubber pollution is toxic to marine life at very low concentrations,” Brown said.

One study found scrubber wastewater at a concentration of 5% killed tiny crustaceans called copepods within one day, and called the wastewater a “witch’s cauldron” of toxic compounds. Another study found that exposure to scrubber discharge affected the reproduction success of some mussel and sea urchin species at even lower concentrations.

Several Southeast tribes have passed resolutions calling for cleaner fuel, including the Yakutat Tlingit Tribe, the Organized Village of Kake, the Organized Village of Kasaan and the Ketchikan Indian Community.

Ilsxilee Stáng Gloria Burns is president of the Ketchikan Indian Community. She said she wants cruise lines to take initiative.

“This practice of fuel dumping makes the cruise ships an extractive industry,” she said.

Burns said the onus is on the cruise industry to build a relationship of reciprocity instead.

Linda Behnken is the executive director of the Alaska Longline Fishermen’s Association and board president of Alaska’s Sustainable Fisheries Trust. She’s fished commercially for 40 years and says the statewide seafood marketing strategy is built on telling the story of Alaska’s healthy, pristine waters.

“To have this information, to me, where we know sort of that dirty secret, I feel like we’re being disingenuous by continuing to build our reputation on this,” she said.

Behnken said Alaskans have a responsibility to protect the water from pollution.

Cruise ships that burn heavy fuel oil are equipped to switch between fuel types.

Some regulations have already taken effect in U.S. waters. Last year, the IMO banned heavy fuel oil in Arctic waters, with some fuel tank exceptions. Scrubber discharge is restricted in Hawaii’s waters and banned within the Port of Seattle. California has long required ships to burn cleaner fuels upon entering its waters.

Sen. Jesse Kiehl, D-Juneau, attended the panel. He said he’s concerned about water pollution from scrubbers, but hasn’t decided on a policy path yet.

He said he’s been meeting with a lot of people about it, including cruise companies.

“We had some serious conversations and they presented some research, some of which I bought and some which I didn’t,” Kiehl said.

Cruise Lines International Association Alaska represents the cruise industry.

“There is no scientific basis to support a ban on [scrubbers],” CLIAA spokesperson Lanie Downs wrote in an email, adding that they “remain an important compliance option as the maritime sector continues to reduce air emissions.”

Alix Pierce, Juneau’s visitor industry director, said in an interview that there’s a long-standing voluntary commitment from the cruise lines to switch to marine gas oil when they’re in Gastineau Channel, while in Juneau’s cruise port and upon departure.

“All we can do is make agreements and ask that they be followed, and even if we did have legislation, I don’t know what our compliance program would look like,” Pierce said.

She said the city has no reason to believe ships aren’t honoring the commitment. But in 2019, Gov. Mike Dunleavy axed state funding for the Ocean Rangers program that had observers aboard cruise ships, so there is no longer oversight on oil slicks. The state’s wastewater permits and ship inspectors only address sewage and grey water, not scrubber wastewater dumping.

Pierce said the city is working to help find alternative shipping fuels through a partnership between ports and cruise lines called the Pacific Northwest to Alaska green corridor project.

“We’re excited to see how we can kind of continue to try to drive change in the alternative fuel space, because that’s really the future,” she said.

She said the group will publish a report in the next few months looking at the feasibility of transitioning cruise ships to another fuel type called green methanol, which can be produced from municipal or agricultural waste. The IMO suggests it could cut carbon and sulfur oxide emissions. Pierce said the effort could move the needle beyond the scrubber problem and meet IMO’s goal to make shipping a net-zero emissions industry by 2050.

Juneau’s last cruise ship of the 2025 season will depart next Tuesday.

This marks the fourth annual disclosure and the second year of benchmarking results against the IMO’s 2023 Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Strategy, which targets net-zero emissions from international shipping by or around 2050.

Rising Misalignment Despite Operational Improvements

According to the report, climate alignment scores for 2024 show an average misalignment of 27.4% with the minimum trajectory and 35.1% with the striving trajectory, both higher than in 2023 (24.8% and 30.8%, respectively).

Despite this setback, the report notes positive progress at the vessel level, particularly in operational efficiency and emissions intensity reduction. However, external challenges such as global supply chain disruptions and geopolitical tensions causing longer voyage routes contributed to higher emissions and overall misalignment.

The 2024 data also indicates a narrower range of climate alignment scores, suggesting greater consistency among signatories. This uniformity is largely due to improved data modeling and collection processes, allowing insurers to better understand and address emissions trends in their portfolios.

Commitment Toward a Sustainable Maritime Future

While the report underscores the gap between current performance and IMO targets, it also highlights a shared commitment to change. Signatories are strengthening their approach by integrating responsible underwriting, educating clients on decarbonization strategies, and collaborating strategically to promote sustainability.

Additionally, insurers are exploring ways to increase coverage for green vessels, adopt efficiency-based underwriting, and leverage sustainability as a competitive advantage. These steps signal a growing recognition that environmental performance is becoming central to long-term business resilience in the maritime sector.

The 2024 PPMI report paints a mixed picture: while progress in efficiency and awareness is evident, the overall alignment with IMO decarbonization goals has weakened. The findings emphasize the urgent need for collective innovation, regulatory support, and industry-wide cooperation to steer global shipping back on course toward net-zero emissions. With continued dedication and collaboration, the maritime insurance sector can play a pivotal role in driving sustainable transformation across the global shipping industry.

President Trump has made it clear that the United States will not accept any international environmental agreement that unduly or unfairly burdens the United States or harms the interests of the American people.

The NZF proposal poses significant risks to the global economy and subjects not just Americans, but all IMO member states to an unsanctioned global tax regime that levies punitive and regressive financial penalties, which could be avoided. The United States is considering the following actions against nations that support this global carbon tax on American consumers:

Pursuing investigations and considering potential regulations to combat anti-competitive practices from certain flagged countries and potential blocking vessels registered in those countries from U.S. ports;

Imposing visa restrictions including an increase in fees and processing, mandatory re-interview requirements and/or revisions of quotas for C-1/D maritime crew member visas;

Imposing commercial penalties stemming from U.S. government contracts including new commercial ships, liquified natural gas terminals and infrastructure, and/or other financial penalties on ships flagged under nations in favor of the NZF;

Imposing additional port fees on ships owned, operated, or flagged by countries supporting the framework; and

Evaluating sanctions on officials sponsoring activist-driven climate policies that would burden American consumers, among other measures under consideration.

While Exxon plans to start offering bunkering services in 2027, it is also “actively developing complementary supply solutions” to support customers who are ready to adopt LNG before that time, the company said in a statement, stopping short of providing details.

It is not clear where the two vessels, chartered respectively from Avenir LNG and Evalend Shipping in the first and fourth quarter of 2027, will be deployed. The ships will be capable of transporting both LNG and biogas-derived bio-LNG.

New Addition

LNG bunkering appears to be a new addition to the $30 billion in “low-carbon opportunities” identified by Exxon during its corporate plan update in December last year — some of which have been facing headwinds. It included low-carbon hydrogen, carbon capture and storage, biofuels, lithium, carbon materials and its patented Proxxima high-performance polymer.

The foray into bunkering marks a key step in supporting the maritime industry’s decarbonization efforts.

“Both LNG and bio-LNG can help reduce lifecycle GHG [greenhouse gas] emissions compared with conventional marine fuels,” Exxon global lower emission fuel manager Amy Wood said.

“As the maritime industry looks for scalable solutions to reduce GHG emissions, Exxon Mobil is leveraging its skills and capabilities to deliver these fuel options,” Wood said.

Exxon’s move follows similar steps by fellow supermajors Shell and TotalEnergies, which have recently expanded their presence in LNG bunkering — Shell through its acquisition of Pavilion Energy, and Total with last year’s final investment decision on Marsa LNG in Oman, the Middle East’s first LNG hub dedicated to bunkering.

Ships, which move close to 90% of global goods, still run overwhelmingly on oil products, but mounting climate pressure, technological breakthroughs and shifting capital are converging to reshape the industry’s fuel choices toward low-carbon fuels.

Regulatory Push

Exxon’s foray into LNG bunkering comes as “supportive policies and rising demand for LNG in marine transportation are creating opportunities,” the company said, emphasizing that technology-neutral policies are essential to accelerate the adoption of lower GHG emission marine fuels.

The US major did not specify which policies it was referring to, but International Maritime Organization (IMO) member states are due to decide at a London meeting on Oct. 14-17 whether to approve the Net-Zero Framework (NZF) designed to put shipping on a trajectory to reach net-zero emissions by midcentury.

The NZF consists of a global fuel standard, a GHG pricing mechanism with credit trading and a revenue-recycling scheme that would use the revenues from the pricing regime to fund green fuel initiatives.

The outcome of the vote is hard to predict. At the last IMO meeting, there was heavy opposition from a handful of flag states and oil exporters, and overt pressure from the Trump administration has also complicated the politics. But the NZF requires a majority of member states, rather than full consensus, to pass.

The shipping industry emits more than 1 billion tons of CO2 annually, accounting for approximately 3% of global human-caused emissions, according to Japanese shipping firm NYK Line.

Transition Fuel

LNG-ready ships account for around 7% of the global fleet by tonnage, the largest share among alternative fuel pathways, supported by existing bunkering infrastructure and local air quality benefits over fuel oil.

Some research suggests the NZF will favor the deployment of ammonia in the medium term, while others estimate it could support first-generation biofuels or even LNG in the short term, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said last month in its Global Hydrogen Review.

“A lot will hinge on the guidelines to be developed in the next few months, and in particular on the default emission factors included in the guidelines on life-cycle GHG intensity of marine fuels,” the IEA said.

LNG is viable as an NZF compliance option over the next five to 10 years, experts and shippers say, but it isn’t generally considered a scalable zero-emission fuel because it still emits CO2 and methane.

Some observers argue that with container vessels typically built for 20–25 year lifespans, LNG newbuilds could face stranded asset risk by the mid-2030s as IMO rules tighten and increasingly favor hydrogen-derived fuels.",https://energyintel.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/768c284/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5476x2875+0+447/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fenergy-intelligence-brightspot.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fc6%2Ffe%2F67a481e54f2b9f1b901530266064%2Fss498488416-logos-companies-exxon.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 18:56:22.294452

“We are excited to welcome this group of international investors as we strengthen our ability to meet surging global demand for zero-emissions solutions.
Their support, alongside our existing shareholders, affirms Corvus’s position as the market leader in maritime energy storage and provides the capital and strategic support we need to accelerate growth in key regions.”","Corvus Energy, which builds energy-storage systems (ESS) for the maritime industry, has secured a US$60M growth capital investment from a Morgan Stanley Investment Management-led consortium that includes Just Climate and Danish shipowner J Lauritzen.

Corvus said the funding will enable the company to accelerate research, development and deployment of its products and to expand production capacity, but said further details on the investment will be announced when the company’s current funding round is completed.

“We have invested heavily in product development to help shipowners and operators cut emissions and operating costs”, Corvus Energy chief financial officer Mette Rokne Hanestad said. “This new capital gives us the firepower to accelerate expansion while maintaining our innovation lead, making our solutions both good for shipowners’ bottom line but also for a more sustainable planet.”

Corvus Energy operates across 15 locations internationally, with manufacturing sites in Norway, Canada and the United States. The company claims to have supplied more than half of the world’s zero-emissions vessels, which are few in number, and said it has delivered more than 1,300 hybrid or all-electric ESS installations worldwide.

""This represents 1,300 MWh of installed capacity and more than 1M operating hours across different segments such as ferries, offshore vessels, tugs, ropaxes and cruise ships – averting an estimated 11M tonnes of CO2 to date,"" the company said.

Some of Corvus Energy’s highest-profile projects include the world’s largest fully-electric vessel and fast ferry, with 42 MWh of Dolphin Energy ESS, built by Incat for South-American operator Buquebus and set to be commissioned by year end.

Powering the world’s first fully electric offshore vessel, an electric commissioning service operation vessel, with nearly 25 MWh of LFP-based energy storage, Blue Whale, the largest LFP battery system yet supplied to a maritime project.

""Methane, a greenhouse gas 82 times more potent than CO2 in the short term, is the primary component in LNG.
Methane emissions from LNG-fuelled ships rose 180% between 2016 and 2023, underscoring the urgent need for informed action,"" the group said.
According to MARBEM, there were an estimated 247,000 tonnes of methane emissions in 2023 from shipping’s global LNG-fuelled fleet.
The newly formed initiative said it is working with policy experts, financial analysts, economists and research institutions to target the uptake of fuels in the maritime sector that are lower in greenhouse gas emissions and other dangerous pollutants than methane-based LNG.","A new initiative, Maritime Beyond Methane (MARBEM), is trying to influence the shipping sector to move away from what the group sees as the ’dominance’ of LNG in newbuild vessels that could slow the shipping sector’s attempt to decarbonise its operations.

The need to avoid further use of the fossil fuel, liquefied natural gas (LNG) is ’urgent’, according to MARBEM.

""Methane, a greenhouse gas 82 times more potent than CO2 in the short term, is the primary component in LNG. Methane emissions from LNG-fuelled ships rose 180% between 2016 and 2023, underscoring the urgent need for informed action,"" the group said.

According to MARBEM, there were an estimated 247,000 tonnes of methane emissions in 2023 from shipping’s global LNG-fuelled fleet. These emissions, they claim, translated to nearly US$950M in annual climate damages – a near-fourfold increase from 2016, when the estimates stood at around US$250M.

The figures incorporate damages and deaths from the effects of ground-level ozone, a critical pollutant formed by methane, and, while significant, the group said it does not fully represent the impact of the pollution.

""This figure still understates total harm by excluding other greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides, localised air quality, and non-fatal health outcomes such as asthma and hospitalisations,"" MARBEM said.

In its research, MARBEM said it used the US EPA’s Social Cost of Methane, a monetary benchmark of the human and environmental impacts of methane-based pollution that the group said is consistent with internationally recognised values.

The group said it aims to provide independent, evidence-based data ""that enables and encourages the sector to make tangible commitments towards future-ready shipping solutions"".

The newly formed initiative said it is working with policy experts, financial analysts, economists and research institutions to target the uptake of fuels in the maritime sector that are lower in greenhouse gas emissions and other dangerous pollutants than methane-based LNG.

With partners in 13 countries focused on the LNG supply chain, including fossil, bio and e-LNG, MARBEM said it aims to ""clarify regulations, technologies, and analyse the trends influencing maritime decarbonisation"".

""LNG continues to dominate ship engine uptake, with LNG dual-fuel vessels accounting for 55% of the current orderbook. If this trend continues, fossil gas could supply more than 10% of the energy used by the global maritime fleet by 2030. At the same time, misaligned solutions, such as e-methane/e-LNG and biomethane/bioLNG, further risk locking the sector into long-term dependence on methane-based fuels, creating a barrier to the transition to a sustainable, zero-emissions future,"" the group said.

With major decisions coming up at shipping’s United Nations-based regulator the International Maritime Organization and within the European Union on the substance of plans for the shipping sector to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions around 2050, MARBEM said it would be working directly to influence regulators.

""In the months ahead, Maritime Beyond Methane will actively engage with IMO, and with EU regulators through the FuelEU negotiations, to inform decisions in line with global climate ambition, supporting the advancement of regulatory frameworks that use informed decision-making that keeps the shipping sector on track towards a just, net-zero emissions future,"" MARBEM said.

""The shipping sector is nearing a critical juncture to be able to move the dial on getting off LNG, and avoiding any alternative that enables locking-in methane and going farther down a pathway where monetary penalties, costly retrofits and early abandonment of vessels will get more severe with the continued use of methane-based fuels that have no real impact on decarbonising shipping and addressing the climate crisis.""",https://dvzpv6x5302g1.cloudfront.net/AcuCustom/Sitename/DAM/151/Gate-Terminal_at_Rotterdam_source_Gate_Terminal_1200w_Thumb.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 16:56:56.192500
