While the global shipping industry faces steep challenges in cutting emissions, Patrick Kettschau, managing director of Everllence China, points to China’s integrated supply chain — from shipyards to alternative fuel production — as a critical solution.

“While decarbonizing the global shipping industry remains a long-term challenge, China, an indispensable partner in this endeavor, is emerging as a driving force in this transformation,” he said.

“This is thanks to its strong industrial base, world-leading shipbuilding capacity and growing strength in renewable energy.”

As the world’s largest consumer and producer of renewable energy, China plays a pivotal role in the transition. Its position as a strategic hub for international shipping and a major investor in clean technologies has attracted multinational collaboration in recent years, he added.

Everllence, which is headquartered in Augsburg, Germany, has been expanding its investment in key technologies, including future fuel engines, hydrogen, carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS), and industrial heat pumps, to support the decarbonization and digital transformation of the global shipping industry, he said.

According to Kettschau, partnerships with Chinese companies have been focusing on developing low and zero carbon engine solutions powered by clean fuels like liquefied natural gas (LNG), liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), methanol and ammonia dual-fuel engines.

“These collaborations are advancing next-generation technologies while driving the integration of innovation, local manufacturing and sustainable growth,” he said.

The push for greener shipping is reshaping China’s energy landscape.

In August, the National Energy Administration formally recognized green liquid fuels, including green ammonia and green methanol, as renewable energy sources, sending a strong signal to the market while aligning with surging global demand.

The global green fuel market, according to market research firm Verified Market Reports, was valued at $70.2 billion in 2023 and is projected to reach $175.1 billion by 2030, with a compound annual growth rate of 12.66 percent.

The International Maritime Organization (IMO) predicts that by 2050, green methanol demand could hit 190 million metric tons, comprising 42 percent of the shipping fuel mix, while fossil fuels shrink to 15 percent.

Beyond the vessels themselves, Chinese utilities are also targeting the carbon footprint of the shipbuilding process.

State Grid Nantong Power Supply Co recently launched a pilot program to create “near-zero carbon “shipyards, implementing precise carbon management across the manufacturing cycle.

By replacing traditional ceramic heating with electromagnetic induction in the welding stage, the project improved heating efficiency by 50 percent and cut power consumption by 60 percent, it said during this year’s United Nations climate change conference, or COP30.

In the coating workshop, which accounts for the bulk of energy use, smart temperature controls reduced electricity usage by 30 percent, while further efficiency gains were realized in the assembly stage, where upgrading air compressors cut power use by 40 percent.

The company has also deployed an AI-driven digital energy management platform, allowing shipyards to schedule energy-intensive production during low-cost electricity periods, creating a commercially viable road map for green manufacturing in the heavy industry sector.

Everllence has just unveiled its new, dual-fuel ME-LGIA (liquid gas injection ammonia) engine. The development of this engine is not just a technical achievement. It is another concrete step to advance the green transition and toward a climate-neutral future, said Kettschau.

“With more than a century of history in China, strong local production capabilities in collaboration with our Chinese ship engine licensees, and a shared commitment to a sustainable future, Everllence will continue working hand-in-hand with Chinese partners,” he said.",,N,,2025-12-05 06:56:58.211930

Marintec China has been held for over four decades, but this is the first year the exhibition features a dedicated section on decarbonization in the shipping sector.

GONG KANGKANG Head, International Organizing Committee for Marintec ""Our current IMO zero-carbon framework has now entered the final stage of implementation. We also needs a platform to bring together global resources to drive the application of decarbonization technologies—from research and development to commercial deployment.""

One key aspect of decarbonization is the use of clean energy.

Currently, the shipping industry mainly relies on LNG and methanol.

More companies are now developing equipment that runs on another fuel: ammonia, which offers higher energy output and zero carbon emissions.

This company is showcasing its latest ammonia engine, unveiled just last month and slated for delivery next year.

UWE LAUBER CEO, Everllence ""This year is a special year I would say because we see so much technology and so much change and that the shipping industry is pushing forward in terms of decarbonization, so ammonia, methanol, all these green fuels and engines and technology which is needed. You can found it here right away. Technology is ready, when the regulations are popping in, we are ready to go for it.""

This institute under CSSC, the world's largest shipbuilding group, is presenting a solution called the ""Green Energy Island"", an integrated unit designed to handle all these needs at sea.

LI XIN Deputy Dean, Shanghai Merchant Ship Design and Research Institute, CSSC ""The green fuel needed for future ships requires zero-carbon in both production and transportation. To meet this requirement, we have chosen to produce, store and resupply green fuel on a single offshore platform. This approach minimizes comprehensive costs, providing an effective green fuel solution for our entire maritime operations.""

Most of the new orders across the globe now come to China.

Despite some disagreements over the IMO's net-zero framework making shipowners more cautious, green innovations continue to advance.

CHEN GANG President, Shanghai Waigaoqiao Shipbuilding, China State Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC) ""During the 14th Five-Year Plan period, we have upgraded the entire green solution across all our ship products. From a low-carbon perspective, we must closely follow international regulatory requirements, maintain ongoing communication with manufacturers and supply chain partners, and deliver offshore equipment and ship products that meet market demands and regulatory standards in a timely manner.""

With new rules coming and technology moving quickly, owners are being urged to invest in long term strategies built on data, flexibility and collaboration.

As shipowners prepare for another year of rapid change, Wärtsilä has outlined four trends it believes will shape how fleets are managed in 2026. The company says the sector is moving into a period where digital systems, mixed-fuel operations and long range planning are becoming standard expectations rather than future concepts.

A central shift is the move toward lifecycle optimisation. Instead of reacting to each new regulation or equipment requirement, owners are being pushed to plan for the entire life of a vessel. This includes environmental impact, fuel efficiency, operating costs and the ability to maintain value over decades. Wärtsilä argues that this approach only works when owners, operators and equipment manufacturers share data and maintain clear operational transparency.

Fuel strategies are also changing. Wärtsilä notes that no single pathway suits every company and that a vessel’s trading pattern, fuel availability and commercial priorities determine the right mix. Many owners are exploring fuel flexible engines, hybrid propulsion and systems designed to prevent methane slip. The company says these options help owners keep their fleets compliant as rules evolve.

Digitalisation and the use of big data remain a challenge for much of the sector, even as leading operators adopt real time analytics to guide daily decisions. Modern vessels often run hybrid power setups and advanced automation, making integrated data systems a requirement. Wärtsilä says the ability to turn operational data into recommendations is already cutting fuel use and emissions for early adopters. Issues related to data governance and system compatibility continue to hinder wider use.

Regulatory uncertainty adds another layer of pressure. The delay in the IMO’s Net Zero Framework has not slowed regional action. Measures like the EU Emission Trading System and FuelEU Maritime are pushing owners to strengthen compliance and reporting processes.

Roger Holm, President of Wärtsilä Marine, says collaboration across the sector is crucial. He states, “As we look ahead to 2026, collaboration will play a vital part in driving the sustainable transformation of shipping and shaping a cleaner and smarter future for the maritime industry.” He adds, “Legislation is critical to accelerating investment in alternative fuels, but it is no silver bullet. Decarbonisation is a team effort.”

For shipowners, the message is clear. Long term planning, flexible fuel strategies and stronger digital foundations will define competitiveness as the next wave of regulations and technologies arrives.",https://thedigitalship.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/favicon.ico,N,,2025-12-04 18:57:24.463352

Without clear regulatory incentives and long-term pricing signals, however, methanol risks remaining a technically capable solution that’s commercially out of reach.","Methanol is positioning itself as a strong near-term contender in the maritime industry’s shift toward low-emission fuels. A new white paper from DNV, Methanol fuel in shipping, highlights how the technology supporting methanol-powered vessels has matured significantly, with more than 450 ships either operating or on order and over 600,000 hours of methanol engine runtime logged to date.

Unlike ammonia or LNG, methanol can be handled using much of the existing port infrastructure, removing the need for new cryogenic systems and reducing both investment and operational complexity. Retrofit solutions are also well developed, offering flexibility for existing fleets.

One of methanol’s most significant selling points is its operational flexibility. Dual-fuel engines can run on methanol alongside other fuels, including biodiesel and, in some configurations, even ethanol. This optionality is a strategic advantage in a volatile regulatory and pricing environment.

Environmentally, methanol offers benefits such as sulfur-free combustion, reduced soot, and lower NOx emissions. In particular, bio- and e-methanol pathways hold potential for achieving ultra-low or even net-negative lifecycle emissions—if production can scale and sourcing remains sustainable.

Cost and Capacity Remain the Deciding Factors

Despite strong technical foundations, methanol faces economic and logistical challenges. Today’s bio-methanol costs hover around USD 2,500 per ton MGOe—roughly three times the price of marine gas oil. On the supply side, global production currently sits at around 2.2 million tons, a small fraction of what could be needed by 2040 if adoption accelerates.

The outlook is starting to shift, with a wave of new capacity investments underway. China currently leads with 43% of all planned low-emissions methanol production projects. But the speed of market development will ultimately be shaped by regulatory frameworks. DNV’s analysis points to the importance of international policy levers such as the IMO’s Net-Zero Framework and the EU’s FuelEU Maritime regulation in driving fuel transition timelines.

Tools like DNV’s Fuel Selector and Alternative Fuels Insight platform are already supporting shipowners in evaluating compliance options, assessing future investment risks, and modeling operational scenarios.

“Efficiency is even higher than for traditional diesel oil” “The figures for both laughing gas and ammonia slip are in the single digit ppms.
“We are where we want to be when it comes to ammonia slip,” he said.
“The engine alone is not enough” “First, we need to support the shipowner in the safe and reliable operation of the ammonia engines.","Over the last decade, Everllence has developed and commercially launched two-stroke, slow-speed dual-fuel engines capable of burning LNG, LPG, ethane, and methanol, offering shipowners the flexibility of selecting the right engine platform and low-carbon intensity fuel for their ship type and route to minimise CO2 and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The engine designer’s R&D efforts have been shaped by owner demands to meet IMO’s GHG emissions reduction ambitions and regional environmental regulations, such as FuelEU Maritime and EU ETS. In all, more than 1,900 alternative fuel-capable engines have been sold by the engine designer since the first ME-GI methane-burning prime mover was delivered more than a decade ago. That accumulated experience has underpinned the development of the ammonia dual-fuel engine.

“For the ammonia engine, we need to have a completely new level of maturity”

But Mr Foldager said in the case of ammonia, Everllence probably spent the most time on developing the B&W ME-LGIA, and it was “the most mature before we sent it to the market.” Mr Foldager said it was decided early on by Everllence – previously known as MAN Energy Solutions – that safety would be paramount in the engine’s development to mitigate any risk in the use of ammonia as a fuel, which is highly toxic.

“We have maintained that position,” he stated. “For the ammonia engine, we need to have a completely new level of maturity before we launch it to the market.” Mr Foldager said the company was under “an enormous amount of pressure” because other engine designers have launched their engines “at an earlier maturity stage, putting pressure on us.”

Despite the commercial pressures, the company stayed the course. It conducted full-scale engine tests at the Research Centre in Copenhagen in 2024 and full-scale testing on a commercial ammonia engine at Mitsui Tamano Works in Japan in 2025. After 150,000 hours of collective work, some 800 tests in Copenhagen and Japan and five years of R&D, Everllence unveiled the engine during a two-day event in mid-November that drew some 350 shipowners, operators, shipbuilders, ports, fuel providers and other maritime stakeholders from around the world.

In the quest to reduce shipping’s CO2 and GHG emissions, Mr Foldager said: “Ammonia is a wonderful fuel because there is no carbon,” adding, “because it is slow burning, it’s perfect for the two-stroke engine.” He said: “There are clear indications that the efficiency is even higher than [for] traditional diesel oil.”

When assessing it through the prism of decarbonisation, you can see why Mr Foldager describes ammonia as a “wonderful fuel.” Ammonia, NH3, is an excellent hydrogen carrier, it is carbon- and sulphur-free and when produced using renewable energy (so-called ‘green ammonia’) becomes a carbon-neutral fuel from a well-to-wake perspective. Additionally, it eliminates concerns around black carbon, methane slip and CO2 emissions.

“Ammonia is a wonderful fuel because there is no carbon”

Initially ME-LGIA engines, like other alternative fuel-capable Everllence B&W two-strokes, will have 5% specific pilot oil consumption.

But Mr Foldager was candid in assessing the risks of ammonia as a marine fuel. “It is toxic,” he said, noting concerns with leakage or ammonia slip in the engine. “It is toxic in handling, not only in the engine, but also in the systems: bunkering, the auxiliary system, the fuel gas supply system, the ventilation system, and emissions. We want to be sure that whatever ammonia comes out of the stack is of extremely low values.”

Mr Foldager emphasised that Everllence has had significant success in mitigating ammonia slip – unburned fuel escaping out of the stack – and nitrous oxide (N2O), which is a by-product of combusting ammonia. N2O, also known as laughing gas, is a powerful GHG gas with a GWP of 273, according to the US EPA.

Data shared during the Everllence event showed ammonia slip at less than 6 ppm across the entire load range. NOx emissions were well within compliance with both Tier II and Tier III regulations as ammonia combustion generates less than 50% of that of diesel combustion. Additionally, N2O, even at 100% load, was well below 2 ppm.

“Efficiency is even higher than for traditional diesel oil”

“The figures for both laughing gas and ammonia slip are in the single digit ppms. We are very proud of what we have achieved,” he said.

To minimise ammonia slip, Mr Foldager said Everllence spent an enormous amount of time on the actual injection process, researching spray patterns, pressure, and the design of the injector. He said the injection that Everllence is using is so-called ‘low sac volume’. Using a small amount of ammonia in the fuel injector nozzle affects the spray characteristics, allowing for the optimisation of atomising of the fuel and reducing unburned fuel.

“We are where we want to be when it comes to ammonia slip,” he said.

More work ahead

But Mr Foldager said that more work remains. “Where we need more work is in the actual system integration. The engine alone is not enough. You need all the other systems on the ship, the fuel gas supply system, the purging system, the ventilation system, etc. How those systems interact is an area where we really need to work very closely with the shipyards, ship designers and enginebuilders to make sure that we optimise the whole system,” he said.

Additionally, all ME-LGIA units will be equipped with a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) system. “If there is a small amount of unburned ammonia from the combustion, we use that in the SCR to further reduce the levels (of NOx slip). The SCR is now interactive with the engine. It is not a separate system now. The engine interacts directly with the control system and the SCR,” he observed. Mr Foldager explained that the interaction with the engine, control system and SCR comes into play when there is “not sufficient ammonia available in the slip.” At that point, he explained, urea could be added when operating in a Tier III area.”

Pilot projects and next steps

Next year will be a big one for Everllence and its ammonia engine, marked by type approval testing and initial service experience. According to Everllence, the first ME-LGIA engine will be delivered in Q1 2026, with bedding-in set for Q4, 2025. Mr Foldager said the company has about 20 pilot projects, many of which have not been made public.

Among those that have been made public are deliveries of Everllence B&W 6G60 ME-LGIA engines for two very-large ammonia carriers for Eastern Pacific Shipping, with factory approval testing (FAT) in Q1 2026 and delivery in Q3 2026.

A further four Everllence 7S60 ME-LGIA engines are destined for four Höegh Autoliner 10,800-CEU pure car and truck carriers. FAT is set for Q3 2026 and delivery in Q2 2027.

And another 7S60 will sit in a Newcastle bulk carrier in Japan, where the engine is currently on the Mitsui E&S testbed.

Mr Foldager said these engines were critical for gaining “the first real life experience in a ship” and “how the shipowner and crew interact with the engine.”

The digitally connected engine

Another important element will be collecting data from each of the engines in service.

“We have developed digitally connected engines. It’s real-life, high-resolution data. It means we receive 500 data points from the engine every minute, 24 hours/seven days a week, 365 days a year. The electronic engine itself produces about 2,000 signals continuously, and 500 of those signals are sufficient for us to know exactly what is happening in the engine,” he said. “It’s data that is generated in the engine from the control system with the sensors. So that means the data quality is impeccable,” said Mr Foldager. “We already have 1,000 engines that are connected this way,” Mr Foldager observed.

The data will enable Everllence to understand the overall health of the engine, troubleshoot any problems before they arise and ensure safety. “We insist that our ammonia engines are connected for two reasons,” explained Mr Foldager.

“The engine alone is not enough”

“First, we need to support the shipowner in the safe and reliable operation of the ammonia engines. We monitor this data 24/7 at our manned remote operation centre to support the owner and the crew.”

Remotely monitoring the data from the engine allows Everllence to make recommendations on optimising engine performance and increasing efficiency.

“In our standard performance report, we have a total of 13 different parameters that we monitor and score to see if the engine can be further optimised,” said Mr Foldager. He said, for example, data can show if the turbocharger is starting to foul. “As a result, we can recommend to the owner that it is probably a good idea to clean the turbocharger now.”

The owner can use the performance report to decide which actions they want to take.

“Second, it allows us to troubleshoot. If there is an issue with the engine, then we have all the data that we need. It enables our engineers to troubleshoot much faster than the traditional way, where we would send an email to the ship’s chief engineer asking them to extract the data and send it back by email. We must wait to receive the data the next day, before looking at it. With the connected engine, we have it instantly,” said Mr Foldager.

One key message that Mr Foldager wanted to share in wrapping up the interview was offered on a slide at the Everllence event. It said simply: ‘We are ready.’",https://dvzpv6x5302g1.cloudfront.net/AcuCustom/Sitename/DAM/184/Everllence_Ammonia_engine_fullwebzhgf1_Main.png,N,,2025-12-04 10:57:08.744129

Issues highlighted included the negative impacts of global security challenges on shipping, the four incoming accessions to the HNS Protocols and the need for ratification of the Cape Town Agreement and the 2021 amendments to the IMO Convention.

Delegations also reaffirmed their support for continued work on the Net Zero Framework.

At the heart of all these efforts remain the world’s seafarers. Their skill, resilience and dedication sustain global trade and the functioning of the world economy. The decisions taken by this Assembly will contribute to strengthening their safety, welfare and working conditions, and for that, I am grateful.

…said Arsenio Dominguez.

In addition, the Assembly further recognized global measures such as the entry into force of the Marine Biological Diversity of Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ) Agreements.

Examples of progress in gender equality and diversity were also noted, including the introduction of maternity allowances for female seafarers by one Member State, reflecting ongoing efforts to foster a more inclusive maritime workforce.

The Secretary-General expressed appreciation for the Assembly’s steps to advance multilingualism, particularly the decision to introduce Arabic as a working language, underscoring the Organization’s commitment to inclusivity and equitable participation across its membership.",https://safety4sea.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54944183490_45505796e0_k-e1764845369571.jpg,N,,2025-12-04 10:57:46.243842

“Actually, energy efficiency will always be part of the most reliable transition strategy, because it offers ROI regardless of fuel type or regulatory scenarios.","As any with a passing interest in shipping’s decarbonization journey will be aware, the Marine Environment Protection Committee meeting held in October postponed the International Maritime Organization (IMO) decision to adopt a Net-Zero Framework (NZF) to price ship carbon emissions from 2028 onwards.

A range of narratives have been offered to explain the conflicting positions taken by administrations at IMO, with lack of agreement expected to re-emerge at future meetings. Some also view the pause in regulatory action as a welcome opportunity to further refine details relating to the Net-Zero Fund proposal and fuel standards.

But the lack of regulatory consensus represents a further development hindrance for an alternative marine fuels market which is already burdened by high production costs, supply chain limitations and the lack of fuel standards. While the 2023 IMO decarbonization strategy remains in place, the postponement has consequences for the fuel choices ship owners make for their newbuilds and retrofits for the months and years ahead.

“Regulatory uncertainty can discourage investments by shipowners, ports, energy providers, and bunkering operators,” observes Charlotte Nonnemann, VP, Regulatory & Public Affairs, Marine Systems, ABB’s Marine & Ports division. “With the adoption, acceptance, and enforcement of the NZF subject to at least a one-year delay, expectations for widespread alternative fuel use by 2030 are fading.”

Net-Zero Realism

One outcome of October´s proceedings appears to be a new realism among shipowners considering new investments, and a resolve to develop strategies that can accommodate a range of future decarbonization scenarios, says Nonnemann.

For the coming five years, she expects pragmatism to prevail in the face of regulatory uncertainty, as owners focus on efficiency gains that also secure decarbonization’s “low hanging fruit”.

Complicating matters is the fact that the EU’s Emissions Trading Scheme and FuelEU Maritime requirements are already in force. Owners and investors moving forward with newbuild or retrofit plans today will need assets which are adaptable to different decarbonization targets through a lifespan of 25 years or more, Nonnemann observes.

As industry watchers will know, the volatility that characterized the maritime markets through 2025 has by no means been bad for the freight and charter rates which drive the business of shipping. One irony of the loss of global regulatory impetus for green ship investments is that it coincides with a cash-rich moment for owners, with bankers also recovering their maritime appetites.

With opportunities better taken than missed, “plug and play” ship technologies which deliver cost- efficiency today and the flexibility to adapt to different decarbonization scenarios represent a sound investment, suggests Jostein Bogen, Global Product Line Manager Electric Solutions, ABB’s Marine & Ports division.

Future flexibility

“There is no doubt that regulatory uncertainty has impacted ROI decisions on green technologies, but demand for shipping services has not been diminished in the meantime: the need to optimize energy efficiency remains just as compelling,” Bogen says.

As a technology supplier dedicated to electric, automated and digital solutions, ABB’s long-term commitment to sustainability remains unchanged, but its systems are also wholly fuel-agnostic,” Bogen explains. “Cost efficiency is a permanent priority for customers, while our power and propulsion solutions support decarbonization independent of regulatory timelines.”

Fragmented regulations on ship emissions also make it more imperative to monitor, report, and analyze data to ensure voyage route efficiency matches charter terms, adds Bogen. “In the current situation, where regional and global regulators are out of step, owners need to be sure that their ships are and will be optimized for different outcomes.”

ABB’s power distribution and propulsion solutions can “plug and play” various energy sources, with generators running on multiple fuel types, battery power, fuel cells and even nuclear reactors, adds Bogen.

But rather than running through the technology options and compliance pathways, he emphasizes that it will be flexibility which safeguards investment.

“Actually, energy efficiency will always be part of the most reliable transition strategy, because it offers ROI regardless of fuel type or regulatory scenarios. Ship system flexibility is also constantly beneficial, but never more so than at the current time, where investors seek to hedge and future-proof vessels for new energy sources down the road.

”I don’t find it controversial to suggest that ships with an electric backbone offer that flexibility. Solutions which use electrification, automation and digitalization to optimize efficiency and are flexible to different fuel transition timelines are a practical way to handle current uncertainties.”

That means training for handling alternative fuels, fuel systems, bunkering procedures, fuel safety, emergency protocols and environmental standards.
That brings us to a code many seafarers already have to know: the International Code of Safety for Ships Using Gases or Other Low-Flashpoint Fuels (IGF Code).
Already under IGF, seafarers working on such ships must follow special training and certification requirements.
What IGF means — and why it matters The IGF Code fills a vital role in this transition.","The shipping industry stands at a turning point. As the world pushes to cut greenhouse-gas emissions, seafarers face a major shift in their everyday work. The push for greener shipping doesn’t end with new fuels and engines. It will demand new skills, new training and new kinds of certification — if seafarers want to stay relevant and safe.

In the report Tides of Change: A Framework for Developing Just and Inclusive Green Shipping Corridors the authors warn, on page 8, that up to 800,000 of the roughly 1.8 million active seafarers worldwide will need additional training by the mid-2030s.

Already, many of the skills and certifications that once sufficed will no longer do. Ships that sail under so-called green corridors or that run on alternative, low-carbon fuels will need crews who understand the new risks and technologies. That means training for handling alternative fuels, fuel systems, bunkering procedures, fuel safety, emergency protocols and environmental standards.

Let me explain how the regulatory framework is shaping up — and what it likely means for you if you sail, or plan to do so.

Why seafarers must prepare — what’s coming

The momentum comes from the International Maritime Organization (IMO). Their proposed IMO Net-Zero Framework (NZF) aims to force big ships (over 5,000 gross tonnage) to lower their greenhouse-gas emissions. The idea: a global fuel standard requiring all ships to gradually switch to cleaner fuels or lower-carbon fuel blends, measured over the full “well-to-wake” lifecycle of the fuel.

Under NZF, ships would need to meet yearly fuel-intensity targets from 2028. Vessels that fail will pay penalties or buy “remedial units,” while low-emission ships can earn credits or contribute to a dedicated fund for clean-fuel adoption.

The push for cleaner shipping aligns with major global pressure. Governments, shippers, fuel suppliers, port operators: all will need to adjust. That means alternative fuels will become more common — biofuels, methanol, ammonia, hydrogen blends or other low-flashpoint fuels. Ships retrofitted or built for such fuels fall under existing safety rules.

That brings us to a code many seafarers already have to know: the International Code of Safety for Ships Using Gases or Other Low-Flashpoint Fuels (IGF Code).

The IGF Code originally covers use of gases — like LNG — or other fuels with a low flashpoint under a critical threshold. It specifies how fuel machinery must be arranged, installed and monitored to ensure safety. The Code entered into force in 2017 after adoption by IMO.

Already under IGF, seafarers working on such ships must follow special training and certification requirements. The training covers safe handling of fuel systems, emergency response, fire prevention, fuel containment, bunkering procedures and environmental protection.

With the shift to a broader range of low-carbon fuels (not just LNG), the need for training will expand. The IGF Code already allows for other low-flashpoint fuels — methanol, ammonia, hydrogen. Ship registries and classification societies have updated their rules accordingly.

Therefore, future seafarers will likely need: familiarization with the specific fuel used; advanced training for masters and engineers responsible for fuel systems; and updated safety and emergency-response certification.

In short: basic seafaring skills remain important — but they will join a growing set of new competencies focused on green fuels, safety and emissions compliance.

How IMO already pushes new training and what’s next

The report “Tides of Change” sees training and upskilling as a central piece of a just transition. It emphasises building local workforce capacities, knowledge transfers, and designing green-corridor projects with training embedded.

Meanwhile, on the regulatory side, the IGF Code remains the foundation for safe operations on ships using low-flashpoint fuels. Training under IGF already splits into at least two levels: basic familiarization for crew with general safety duties, and advanced training for officers with direct responsibility for fuels and fuel systems.

This means the maritime training institutions and maritime administrations will have to scale up — not only for LNG but also for a broader set of fuels as the green transition unfolds.

Starting 2024, the Code itself has seen amendments. The regulatory bodies keep updating technical requirements for fuel containment, fire safety, materials, and overall design and operation guidelines under IGF.

As green shipping corridors expand, and alternative fuels become more common, seafarers will likely need to prove competency in exactly the fuel type used onboard. That may include fuel-specific certification or endorsements, depending on the flag state and vessel type.

NZF postponed — but nothing stops momentum

It is important to note: during the last extraordinary session of the IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) in October 2025, member states agreed to postpone adoption of the Net-Zero Framework by one year.

That means formal global rules will not yet apply — at least until the vote reconvenes in 2026. Still, many industry stakeholders expect NZF to pass eventually. Pressure from regulators, ports, fuel producers and societies favour adoption.

Even without immediate legal force, the shift toward alternative fuels and low-carbon operations already moves forward. Shipowners who want to stay ahead, and charterers or cargo owners demanding lower emissions, likely will push for compliance with best-available standards. That means more ships will get retrofitted or built for low-flashpoint fuels. Crew training will follow.

Thus, seafarers who start thinking ahead — upskilling, seeking additional certification under IGF or fuel-specific modules — will gain a significant advantage.

What IGF means — and why it matters

The IGF Code fills a vital role in this transition. Under the code, any ship that uses gases or other low-flashpoint fuels for propulsion must meet safety standards. The code regulates everything from fuel storage and containment, to machinery, venting systems, fire safety, emergency procedures and crew training.

Beyond technical rules, IGF imposes operational requirements: crews must receive appropriate training depending on their duties. Masters, engineers, and others responsible for fuel use and fuel systems must complete “advanced training.” Other seafarers with safety or fuel-handling duties must at least get “basic familiarization.”

The code officially entered into force on 1 January 2017. Still, as new fuels (methanol, ammonia, hydrogen, bio-fuels) enter shipping, the code’s scope expands. Administration and classification societies continuously update guidance and regulations to cover these fuels.

Therefore IGF — and the associated training — stands already as maritime’s baseline for safe, low-emission propulsion. As the industry moves toward net zero, it will likely become even more central.

What this means for seafarers — take care about your future

If you sail, or plan to work at sea, now is the time to act. Relying on old certifications may not be enough in a few years. Alternative fuels and stricter emissions rules will demand new competencies.

Signing up for training under IGF Code requirements, or fuel-specific courses, will likely pay off. Masters and engineers would benefit most when they take advanced training focused on handling low-flashpoint fuels, bunkering procedures, fuel safety, emergency response and environmental compliance.

Vessel operators and shipping companies will need to plan human-resources development earlier. They must anticipate that many seafarers will need retraining or reskilling. Green-corridor projects should embed training and certification from the start, rather than treating them as an afterthought.

Even though adoption of the NZF is delayed, the broader trend remains clear. Ships will increasingly sail on alternative fuels. Regulations will tighten. The industry will demand new skills and certifications.

For you, this transition could mean better job security — provided you prepare now. It could also open new opportunities: operating green-fuel ships, becoming part of pioneering green-corridor crews, or even working with bunkering and alternative-fuel logistics.",https://seaemploy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ChatGPT-Image-Dec-4-2025-10_37_11-AM-e1764841075582.webp,N,,2025-12-04 14:56:50.536053

The announcement was made on Thursday (4 December), reports Manifold Times.

The new vessel will replace Seafuels’ current bunkering ship, Awanuia, which has served Auckland for 18 years. The contract has been awarded to Ada Denizcilik Ve Tersane Isletmeciligi, a shipbuilder based in Tuzla, Turkey.

The new tanker will be 88.8 metres long and built as an IMO Class II Chemical Tanker. It is expected to be completed and named in late 2027. The USD 50 million project includes the construction of the vessel, which will be capable of supplying two cleaner fuel options—biodiesel and methanol—along with low-sulphur fuel and marine diesel oil.

Port of Auckland CEO Roger Gray said the project is an important step in supporting low-carbon shipping. “We have worked with our shipping line customers to understand their future fuel needs, and we’re pleased to offer a practical tool to support cleaner shipping,” he said.

Seafuels Director Allan D’Souza said the investment highlights the port’s commitment to innovation, safety, and sustainability, as the maritime industry moves toward cleaner energy.

The global shipping sector accounts for 2–3% of total emissions. The International Maritime Organization aims to achieve zero emissions by 2050, and Port of Auckland is working towards the same goal. The new bunkering vessel adds to the port’s sustainability efforts, which include the launch of Sparky, the world’s first full-sized electric tugboat, in 2022.

Issues around retrofitting complexity, deck-space constraints and regulatory exposure are emerging as critical pressure points for the sector, says the influential risk management body DNV.

Net-Zero Guide: Practical Approaches for Global Shipping Companies outlines the technical hurdles shipowners face when shifting to methanol, ammonia and other zero-carbon fuels. While much of the industry is accelerating toward dual-fuel newbuilds, DNV warns many existing vessels will be difficult – or uneconomic – to convert, highlighting the need for detailed feasibility assessments covering engine compatibility, tank-space requirements and dry-docking time.

Older vessels

For the MPP and heavy-lift fleet, the guidance carries particular weight. The segment’s vessels are typically older, highly customised and engaged in long-distance, irregular trading patterns – factors that DNV says complicate both fuel-transition planning and access to bunkering infrastructure.

DNV also says that new energy-saving technologies, such as wind-assisted propulsion or onboard carbon-capture systems, demand significant deck reinforcement or volume allocation, which may clash with the sector’s reliance on open-deck capacity for outsized project cargo.

Vulnerability

The report warns that decarbonisation costs are rising fastest for smaller operators, who face the same regulatory burden as deep-sea container and tanker carriers but with fewer resources. Many MPP owners fall into this category, and DNV points to small to medium businesses’ increased vulnerability to delays in yard availability, high retrofit costs, and the growing need for digital reporting systems under schemes such as CII, EU ETS and FuelEU Maritime.

Yet despite the challenge, DNV’s overall message is that the transition presents an opportunity for project-cargo carriers to future-proof fleets through fuel-ready designs, targeted retrofits and early alignment with charterers seeking lower-emission transport options.

“The journey to net zero will be more than a regulatory obligation – it is a strategic opportunity to redefine maritime operations for a sustainable future,” says DNV.",https://www.projectcargojournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/decarbonisedship.jpg,N,,2025-12-04 05:56:10.476248

“Large container vessels present a unique propulsion challenge,” said Benny Hilström, Vice President, Market Development at WinGD.
“Building on our long-standing diesel engine expertise and our deep experience in LNG dual-fuel technology, we’ve developed the X‑DF‑HP.

Unveiled at Marintec China 2025, the new engine arrives at a pivotal moment for shipowners navigating the energy transition, with the IMO’s Net Zero Framework currently paused and the prospect of regional regulation becoming increasingly fragmented. As a result, interest in LNG-fuelled tonnage continues to accelerate.

Available in X82 and X92 bore sizes, the X-DF-HP is tailored to the scale, speed and load requirements of the ULCV sector, with first deliveries planned for 2028. Based on comparisons between the efficiency of WinGD’s established diesel engines and similar dual-fuel designs, the high-pressure dual-fuel concept is anticipated to deliver improved efficiency.

“Large container vessels present a unique propulsion challenge,” said Benny Hilström, Vice President, Market Development at WinGD. “They demand immense power, exceptional efficiency and long-term fuel flexibility. With the X-DF-HP, we are providing operators with a purpose-built solution for the most power-hungry vessels, offering uncompromised, trouble-free propulsion.”

Available with the same auxiliary system requirements—such as fuel supply pressure—as other recognised engine concepts, it supports straightforward installation for shipyards and provides a practical, future-ready option for vessel owners. Achieving Tier III compliance in both gas and diesel modes using only a standard SCR, X-DF-HP offers operators a powerful, space-efficient and future-ready choice for the most demanding ultra-large container vessels.

“The X-DF-HP is built on the high-pressure Diesel X92-B engine platform that has already proven itself as one of the most efficient and reliable large-bore solutions in the container segment,” said Sebastian Hensel, Vice President R&D at WinGD. “Building on our long-standing diesel engine expertise and our deep experience in LNG dual-fuel technology, we’ve developed the X‑DF‑HP. Our tests and simulations show the X-DF-HP will deliver a clear step up in fuel efficiency and GHG performance compared to existing high-pressure dual-fuel engines on the market.”

The X-DF-HP builds on more than a century of high-pressure Diesel cycle expertise and dual-fuel innovation at WinGD. It joins the company’s high-pressure, multi-fuel portfolio, which includes the methanol/ethanol-capable X-DF-M/E and ammonia-fuelled X-DF-A engines. This provides operators with a fully fuel-flexible platform, with established engines such as the X92-B now able to be retrofitted for high-pressure LNG, methanol, ethanol, or ammonia as fuel pathways evolve.

With LNG providing FuelEU Maritime compliance well into the next decade, and uncertainty remaining around future IMO requirements, LNG continues to offer a cost-competitive, low-risk route to fleet decarbonisation. WinGD’s X-DF (low pressure) and X-DF-HP engines are fully compatible with renewable methane blends, enabling operators to progress towards lower-carbon operations without extensive mechanical modifications or the high retrofitting costs typically associated with emerging fuels.

“For ultra-large container vessels choosing LNG as their pathway to net zero, the X-DF-HP is the most cost-effective option,” added Hilström. “For all other vessels, the low-pressure X-DF platform continues to deliver the best lifecycle economics.

These agreements are expected to bolster Oman’s logistics competitiveness and support its goals for decarbonization.

The first MoU was established with the Republic of Türkiye on November 24, focusing on collaboration in transport, international transport corridors, communications, and information technology. This agreement was negotiated at a ministerial level between Oman’s Minister of Transport, Eng Said bin Hamoud al Maawali, and Türkiye’s Abdulkadir Uraloğlu. It signifies a strengthening of bilateral relations, which have already seen developments this year, including the formation of an Omani-Turkish coordinating council and reciprocal visa facilitation measures. These steps are set to enhance the flow of people and goods between the two nations, while also enabling Omani ports to potentially improve their transit volumes to Mediterranean and European markets via new transport corridors.

In a complementary move, Oman also signed an MoU with the Republic of the Philippines to mutually recognize seafarers’ certificates. This essential agreement, signed by Eng Khamis bin Mohammed al Shammakhi of Oman and Sonia B Malaluan from the Philippines’ Maritime Industry Authority, is aimed at simplifying crew certification processes, promoting labor mobility, and reducing administrative challenges for ship operators employing diverse crews. The initiative is particularly impactful for Oman’s shipping and offshore sectors, as it expands access to a recognized pool of seafarers, helping to lower crewing costs and alleviate manpower shortages for regional shipping lines.

Oman’s delegation at the IMO also pursued broader partnerships, including discussions in London with Austria’s embassy focused on sustainable maritime development and green energy initiatives. These talks reflect a dual approach: enhancing Oman’s logistics assets while adhering to international environmental and safety standards, which are critical in today’s chartering and financing contexts.

Oman’s proactive engagement at the IMO sessions and participation in the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) indicates a strategy aimed at aligning economic growth with sustainability.

During an interview at the Singapore Maritime Week on April 19, he stated that the sector is on track to finalize a comprehensive strategy by next year to meet targets aimed at net-zero emissions by 2050. This plan marks a significant update from 2018, which encouraged a 50% reduction in emissions but lacked firm interim targets for 2030 and 2040.

The revised strategy, announced in 2023, outlines measures intended for approval by 2025, with implementation slated for 2027. Net-zero emissions imply a balance where greenhouse gas emissions are equivalent to those being removed from the atmosphere. To assist in achieving these objectives, the IMO is collaborating with external consultants to analyze various scenarios and assess stakeholder concerns. Additionally, the organization is developing a technical and financial framework to facilitate the transition.

The IMO, a specialized agency of the United Nations with 176 member states, oversees the safety, security, and environmental performance of international shipping. Notably, the interest in cleaner marine fuels, such as methanol, is rising as part of the emissions reduction strategy. The demand for methanol-powered ships has surged, with 138 orders placed in 2023 compared to only 35 the previous year. Among these orders was a significant acquisition by the Singapore-based Ocean Network Express, which is set to receive 12 methanol dual-fuel ships by 2027.

Aligned with these initiatives, Singapore is advancing its maritime sector’s transition by establishing a maritime energy training facility designed to equip approximately 10,000 seafarers and maritime personnel with the skills needed for using cleaner fuels. This facility is expected to be operational by 2026. Singapore’s port terminals aim to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, as outlined in the Maritime Singapore Decarbonisation Blueprint launched in 2022.

IMO Delay The company has not yet seen signs of the IMO NZF delay dampening enthusiasm for nuclear reactors in shipping.
Costs The company puts the up-front capital cost of a large ship with nuclear propulsion at about $700 million.

Core Power sees potential in US-Europe and US-Asia routes as the likely first contenders for this type of ship.","The use of nuclear reactors in shipping has the potential to appeal to bridge the widening divide between supporters and skeptics on decarbonisation, according to technology firm Core Power.

Over the past seven years Core Power has been developing the use of nuclear reactors in commercial shipping, at first as floating power plants and subsequently for nuclear-powered propulsion, and the firm hopes to see its first orders before the end of this decade.

The technology can appeal both to those disappointed and encouraged by the IMO's recent decision to delay a vote on its net-zero framework by being both a means of decarbonisation and a means of improving on current technologies, Mikal Bøe, CEO of Core Power, said at a press briefing event last week.

""We're starting to see this sort of entrenchment of two camps, almost like left and right in politics, where net zero says we've got to save the planet, and we've got to impact the way we do things to do so, and the other side says, actually the planet is going to be fine,"" he said.

""I see nuclear emerging in the gap, because it's the only thing that solves both; one that says, here is a way of not emitting anything and using a lot less resources to generate a lot more effect, and then on the other side, which is the anti-net-zero camp, we can say we're getting double or triple the generating capacity.""

Earlier this year the firm hired Charlotte Vere, a former UK maritime minister and member of the House of Lords, as vice president for international relations.

""Whether you're in the UK or the US, the focus on nuclear is huge, and it's bipartisan,"" Vere said at the event.

""It's not a question of one side of politics or the other wanting to take forward the opportunities that we see in nuclear.

""Just look what's happening in the US; President Trump, like him or loathe him, is absolutely focused on it, because he sees it as a way of projecting American energy dominance throughout the world.""

IMO Delay

The company has not yet seen signs of the IMO NZF delay dampening enthusiasm for nuclear reactors in shipping.

""I was a bit worried about that; when this first happened, I was on a business trip going around speaking to a lot of shareholders and some new companies as well, a bit nervous about what they were going to say,"" Bøe told Ship & Bunker at the event.

""Are they going to say, 'Great, now we doing have to do anything, we can just carry on as usual'?""

""The reaction I got was different, it was one that said, 'Phew, thankfully now we don't have to go down this route; we can focus on what's important, and we can now focus on the things that give us a competitive advantage, the things that help us create a better industry.'""

Order Expectations

The firm has previously said it expects to receive its first reactor orders for ships by the end of the 2020s.

The first of these reactors is likely to be installed on a ship by 2033, Bøe said last week.

""The first installation that we've now got being designed is due for 2033, and then there's a lot of trialling and testing and validation et cetera,"" he said.

""And then that orderbook starts to build, so we assume that the first orderbook that comes form that will be in the region of 15 to 20 ships, which will then be constructed between 2034-5 to the end of that decade, and then it starts to accelerate from there.

""We see an opportunity to get to the 3,000 ship mark up to about 2060.

""It's not about meeting a 2030 target, it's about creating a product that demonstrates how you can really make a big difference in both shipping and power generation.""

Costs

The company puts the up-front capital cost of a large ship with nuclear propulsion at about $700 million.

But because the reactors on these vessels will come loaded with enough fuel to run for at least the 25-year commercial life of this ship, this cost needs to be compared to the cost of buying a new conventionally-fuelled ship and all of the bunker fuel it will consume over its lifetime.

Using this calculation, nuclear propulsion could be competitive at bunker prices not far off today's level, Bøe said.

""All the models are pointing to being a competitor with bunkers at about $600/mt,"" he said.

The VLSFO price has averaged at about $585.50/mt at 20 leading hubs around the world this year, according to Ship & Bunker's G20-VLSFO Index.

Core Power's calculation does not include other savings and revenues that a ship with nuclear propulsion could generate, including EU or other GHG costs, and the potential to sell excess power supply to ports while at berth.

Another factor not included is the higher speeds at which these vessels could operate, meaning they can carry more cargo per year, as a ship with nuclear propulsion would not need to limit its speed to optimise bunker consumption and cut emissions.

""We should be designing ships that could do - for bulkers and tankers - 17, 18, 19 knots, and we should be designing container ships that should do north of 30 knots,"" Bøe said.

""It creates an efficiency in the industry that makes it more competitive.""

Where Might Ships With Nuclear Propulsion Operate?

The issue of where the first ships with nuclear propulsion might operate is a complex one.

Nuclear regulators in the state where the ship is flagged will put controls on where the ship can operate, and not every country is likely immediately to accept the arrival of ships with nuclear reactors at its ports.

Core Power sees potential in US-Europe and US-Asia routes as the likely first contenders for this type of ship.

""It's going to be Transatlantic or Transpacific,"" Bøe said.

""My bet is a sort of troika or quadrangle of South Korea, Japan, Canada, United States in the Pacific, with Australia appended to it because of the submarine deal that the Australians have done with the US and UK.

""And then I think in the Atlantic, it's the mogas trade - the faster movement of the mogas arbitrage in the Atlantic - which is basically LRs and MRs, and then container ships.""",https://shipandbunker.cdn.speedyrails.net/a/img/_mt_2f47860819d0f2f3071d34b84522b192.jpg,N,,2025-12-03 10:57:33.593351

The maritime industry is undergoing rapid technological advancements, and the need for seafarers to be adept in the use of sustainable technology is more pressing than ever. A recent study by DNV and the Singapore Maritime Foundation revealed that 85% of seafarers acknowledged a strong need for training in new fuels, with 87% specifically requesting instruction on ammonia, hydrogen, and methanol.

Further highlighting the urgency of this training, a report from the International Transport Workers’ Federation and the World Maritime University called for a global educational reform to equip seafarers for the upcoming transition to sustainable fleets.

Teo Keong Kok, managing director at WMI, pointed out the critical need for seafarers to continuously reskill, especially in decarbonization and alternative fuels. He expressed confidence that Wärtsilä’s cutting-edge simulator technology will provide high-quality maritime training, ensuring students are well-prepared for the industry’s ongoing transformation.

We already have the tools in the toolbox to build a cleaner, smarter future for global shipping,” said Roger Holm, President, Wärtsilä Marine.","Wärtsilä has identified four key trends it expects to shape the global shipping industry in 2026, citing accelerating digitalization, rising decarbonization pressures and growing uncertainty over regulatory trajectories.

The company highlighted lifecycle optimization as a major theme, with vessel owners increasingly moving from short-term fixes to long-term strategies that account for environmental impact, operational efficiency and economic performance from vessel design to end-of-life. It said collaboration between owners, operators and equipment makers is becoming more important as regulations evolve and new technologies enter the market.

Wärtsilä said decarbonization strategies are becoming more flexible and tailored as owners weigh alternative fuels, operational profiles and commercial priorities. Fuel-flexible engines, hybrid propulsion systems and methane slip mitigation technologies were noted as emerging tools to maintain competitiveness as the regulatory landscape tightens.

Digitalization and the wider use of big data were identified as another trend, driven by the increasing technical complexity of vessels and growing interest in analytics that can optimise operations in real time, reducing fuel consumption, emissions and costs. Wärtsilä noted that full-scale adoption remains limited by issues such as integration and data governance.

The company also pointed to less predictable regulation as a continuing challenge. It said that despite delays to the IMO’s Net-Zero Framework, regional initiatives such as the EU Emissions Trading System and FuelEU Maritime are shaping compliance requirements for a wide segment of the industry, driving demand for more robust reporting and monitoring capabilities.

“As we look ahead to 2026, collaboration will play a vital part in driving the sustainable transformation of shipping and shaping a cleaner and smarter future for the maritime industry.

“Legislation is critical to accelerating investment in alternative fuels, but it is no silver bullet. Decarbonization is a team effort. The maritime ecosystem is full of remarkable ingenuity and world-class technical excellence that we can use to drive decarbonisation and digitalisation hand in hand. We already have the tools in the toolbox to build a cleaner, smarter future for global shipping,” said Roger Holm, President, Wärtsilä Marine.",https://images.marinelink.com/images/maritime/w800/pawinee-adobe-166026.jpeg,N,,2025-12-03 07:56:08.016420

Wärtsilä Marine in brief Wärtsilä Marine is a global pioneer in power, propulsion and lifecycle solutions for the marine market.","As the maritime industry prepares to enter 2026, technology group Wärtsilä has identified four important trends that will affect global shipping in 2026. From the rise of digitalisation and big data to the growing importance of flexible decarbonisation strategies, these trends are set to redefine competitiveness, efficiency, and sustainability for vessel owners and operators worldwide:

Lifecycle optimisation: With rapid technological advances and evolving regulations, vessel owners are shifting from short-term fixes to holistic, long-term strategies. Lifecycle optimisation considers environmental impact, operational efficiency, and economic viability from vessel design through to end-of-life, supporting smarter investment decisions and asset value preservation. Collaboration and transparency between owners, operators, and OEMs are key to maximising benefits and navigating future uncertainties.

Flexible decarbonisation strategies: Decarbonisation approaches must be tailored to each vessel’s operational profile, available fuels, and business priorities. A flexible strategy - encompassing planning, integration, and continuous monitoring - ensures vessels remain competitive and compliant as technology and regulations evolve. Investments in fuel-flexible engines, hybrid propulsion, and methane slip mitigation are among the solutions enabling owners to future-proof their fleets.

Digitalisation, big data, and analytics: The increasing complexity of vessels - featuring hybrid setups, advanced power management, and alternative fuel systems - demands robust digital integration. Harnessing onboard data through advanced analytics enables real-time operational recommendations, driving significant reductions in fuel consumption, emissions, and operational costs. While some industry leaders are already leveraging these capabilities, widespread adoption is still hindered by challenges such as data governance and integration, but the path forward is clear.

Less predictable regulations: Despite the recent delay in the IMO’s Net-Zero Framework, the regulatory landscape continues to evolve, with regional initiatives like the EU Emission Trading System and FuelEU Maritime impacting a significant portion of global shipping. As businesses prepare for stricter emissions requirements, robust compliance and reporting protocols are becoming essential.

Looking ahead

“As we look ahead to 2026, collaboration will play a vital part in driving the sustainable transformation of shipping and shaping a cleaner and smarter future for the maritime industry. Wärtsilä’s leadership in fuel flexibility, integration and cross-industry partnerships reflects the growing need for OEMs, operators, ports, fuel providers and regulators to work together. We stand shoulder-to-shoulder with our customers, bringing innovative solutions, expert guidance and a clear focus on enhancing efficiency and creating long-term value,” comments Roger Holm, President, Wärtsilä Marine.

Holm continues: “Legislation is critical to accelerating investment in alternative fuels, but it is no silver bullet. Decarbonisation is a team effort.

This is supported by over 450 methanol-capable vessels in operation and on order and technical solutions now available for all major ship types.
But, as with all alternative fuels, methanol’s future role will depend on a combination of regulatory, economic, and operational factors.
Methanol is one option that draws on established technologies and infrastructure, and it is encouraging to see the industry’s growing interest in a variety of alternative fuels.” Methanol can offer environmental benefits.
However, the report notes that cost and availability remain significant barriers, as is the case for many alternative fuels.","As the industry explores multiple decarbonization pathways, methanol is gaining attention as a practical and scalable alternative fuel for deep-sea shipping. This is supported by over 450 methanol-capable vessels in operation and on order and technical solutions now available for all major ship types.

DNV’s latest white paper, “Methanol fuel in shipping,” highlights that methanol-fuelled engines and technical systems have reached high readiness levels, and that existing global production sites, storage facilities, and a growing bunker fleet are providing a strong platform for wider adoption. In addition, industry stakeholders are already investing in the fuel, with China accounting for 43 percent of planned global low-GHG methanol production capacity. But, as with all alternative fuels, methanol’s future role will depend on a combination of regulatory, economic, and operational factors.

Knut Ørbeck-Nilssen, CEO Maritime at DNV said: “As the maritime industry explores pathways to a lower-carbon future, it is important to consider a range of practical and scalable solutions. There is no one-size-fits-all answer, and different shipping segments and geographies will require different approaches. Methanol is one option that draws on established technologies and infrastructure, and it is encouraging to see the industry’s growing interest in a variety of alternative fuels.”

Methanol can offer environmental benefits. It is sulfur-free, produces negligible soot, and emits significantly less NOx than fuel oil. The report highlights that certain bio- and e-methanol pathways can deliver very low or even negative lifecycle emissions, and that methanol’s compatibility with existing port infrastructure and the availability of interim bunkering solutions may also reduce complexity and cost for shipowners.

However, the report notes that cost and availability remain significant barriers, as is the case for many alternative fuels. Bio-methanol prices in 2025 average around USD 2,500 per tonne MGOe, roughly three times the cost of marine gas oil, while global production stands at just 2.2 million tonnes, far below the potential demand of up to 60 million tonnes by 2040. The report models four demand scenarios, showing that regulatory frameworks such as the IMO’s Net Zero Framework and FuelEU Maritime could be decisive in scaling up adoption.

Marius Leisner, Senior Principal Consultant in DNV added: “From a technical perspective, methanol-fuelled engines have demonstrated high reliability, with industry data indicating that modern dual-fuel engine designs have accumulated more than 600,000 operating hours on methanol. Retrofit feasibility is well established, and the use of conventional bunkering systems, unlike cryogenic fuels, means ports can adapt quickly and cost-effectively.",,N,,2025-12-03 07:56:33.002255

The study found that the average sulfur content of marine fuel in open ocean areas fell nearly tenfold after the International Maritime Organization introduced a 0.5% sulfur cap in 2020. While many ships previously exceeded the old 3.5% limit, only a small fraction now breach the new standard.

The evidence indicates ships now emit roughly seven times less sulfur than before, marking a major improvement for air quality and coastal health.

Even stricter European Sulfur Emission Control Areas, such as the English Channel and the Port of Tyne, recorded sulfur levels well below the 0.1% requirement. Some ports outside these zones, including Valencia, also showed low levels thanks to EU rules mandating cleaner fuel while docked.

It’s a big reduction, largely in line with the change in regulations. It will undoubtedly improve air quality in regions close to shipping, although the reduction in sulfur might have an unintended global cooling effect due to the change in ship plumes interacting with clouds

Upon completion, the project will set a benchmark for advanced liquid ammonia carriers domestically and globally, offering a replicable and scalable ""China Solution"" for the green development of the shipping industry.","Recently, China's first domestically built 41,000 m³ ammonia-dual-fuel LPG/liquid ammonia carrier, independently developed and designed by Shanghai Merchant Ship Design and Research Institute (SDARI) under China State Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC) for Tianjin Xinan Shipping Co., Ltd., officially commenced construction at CSSC Huangpu Wenchong Shipbuilding Company. The launch of this project marks a breakthrough for China in the field of ammonia-fueled powered vessels for medium-sized gas carriers, injecting new momentum into the low-carbon transformation of the shipping industry.

Technical Highlights: Innovative Design Combining Environmental and Economic Advantages

Leading Environmental Friendliness: As China's first medium-sized gas carrier adopting ammonia-dual-fuel power, the vessel is equipped with an internationally advanced ammonia-dual-fuel propulsion system and Sweden's Alfa Laval ammonia fuel supply system (FCM Ammonia), covering key modules such as fuel supply, ammonia release mitigation, and fuel valve control, ensuring the safe and efficient application of ammonia fuel. Its design fully complies with the International Maritime Organization (IMO) Tier III emission standards and the EEDI Phase 3 requirements. Compared to mainstream LNG dual-fuel vessels, the full life cycle carbon emissions can be reduced by 61% in specific scenarios, directly contributing to the achievement of IMO's 2050 ""net-zero emissions"" target.

Outstanding Economic Benefits: The vessel adopts three IMO Type A independent liquid cargo tanks and two deck tanks, with a total tank capacity of approximately 42,000 m³ and a minimum design temperature of -50°C, allowing flexible transportation of various cargoes including LPG and liquid ammonia. In terms of energy-saving design, the vessel features SDARI's characteristic low-wave-added-resistance S-BOW straight bow lines and the energy-saving duct independently developed by its subsidiary, SDARI-ECO. The hull's hydrodynamic performance is significantly improved, operational energy consumption is effectively reduced, achieving a balance between economy and environmental protection.

Industrial Layout: Scaling Up the Development of Green Ships

It is reported that this 41,000 m³ ammonia-dual-fuel carrier is an important part of the series of vessel types developed in cooperation between Tianjin Xinan Shipping and CSSC Huangpu Wenchong. The two parties previously signed construction contracts for three 25,000 m³ and four 41,000 m³ ammonia-dual-fuel LPG/liquid ammonia carriers. The commencement of construction of this first vessel will propel this series into the mass production phase. Among these, the first set of ammonia fuel supply systems is expected to be delivered by the end of 2025, laying the foundation for subsequent vessel construction.

As a major domestic shipyard for building gas carriers, CSSC Huangpu Wenchong currently holds orders for 16 gas carriers, covering several mainstream vessel types such as 60,000 m³, 48,000 m³, and 41,000 m³, achieving a leap in technological self-sufficiency and synergistic advantages in the industry chain within the small and medium-sized gas carrier sector. The commencement of construction of this ammonia-dual-fuel vessel further enriches its new energy vessel portfolio and consolidates its leading position in the field of green shipping equipment.

Industry Significance: Leading the Upgrade of the Low-Carbon Maritime Energy Supply Chain

Meanwhile, EmissionLink’s Managing Director has warned that the IMO’s decision to delay its Net Zero Framework is creating a regulatory vacuum which threatens to fragment global shipping decarbonization efforts.

The IMO Assembly has selected ten states with the largest interest in providing international shipping services to join the IMO Council under category (a), encompassing China, Greece, Italy, Japan, Liberia, Norway, Panama, the Republic of Korea, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and the United States of America.

Ten more states secured a spot in category (b), said to have the largest interest in international seaborne trade, encapsulating Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, India, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and the United Arab Emirates.

The remaining category (C) is made up of 20 states not elected under (a) or (b) segments, which have special interests in maritime transport or navigation and whose election to the Council will ensure the representation of all major geographic areas of the world.

The list of these 20 countries includes the Bahamas, Belgium, Chile, Cyprus, Egypt, Finland, Indonesia, Jamaica, Malaysia, Malta, Mexico, Morocco, Nigeria, Peru, Philippines, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, and Türkiye.

While the newly elected Council will meet for its 136th session on December 4, 2025, and elect its Chair and Vice-Chair for the next biennium, EmissionLink’s Managing Director claims that several countries are already moving to fill the void in the wake of the IMO’s move to postpone its Net Zero Framework.

In light of this, the UK Emissions Trading Scheme (UK ETS) will come into force in June 2026, Türkiye is preparing its own version, and Gabon on Africa’s west coast has openly discussed a local carbon levy, with more governments likely to follow, driven as much by fiscal pressures as environmental goals.

Philippos Ioulianou, Managing Director of EmissionLink, commented: “What looks like a pause is, in reality, an open door for national governments to move ahead with their own systems. Instead of gaining clarity, we risk creating a patchwork of unaligned carbon schemes that will make global compliance significantly harder for shipowners.

“For many governments facing widening budget gaps, carbon pricing offers a quick route to new revenue. Without a unified global framework, carbon markets could become less about decarbonisation and more about balancing the books.

“Good luck to the shipowner who gets it wrong. Picture a vessel calling at a West African port, unaware of a newly introduced local regulation. The port authority could detain it for non-compliance and the owner is left footing the bill.”

Ioulianou warns that regionalized systems will multiply reporting formats, verification rules, and administrative burdens, creating real operational risks, adding that some owners are already adjusting trade patterns to avoid overlapping schemes. He also raised concerns about the way revenues from emerging national carbon schemes would be used.

Ioulianou emphasized: “There is no assurance that these funds will flow back into decarbonisation. Some governments won’t even know how much they’ll collect until year-end and once the money arrives, the temptation to redirect it to other priorities will be strong. Managing this manually, port by port or across scattered spreadsheets, is no longer realistic.

“Owners need real-time intelligence on regulatory changes and data they can act on — long before they reach the next port of call. […] Every new national scheme makes it harder for the IMO to rebuild a globally aligned approach later. Once rules fracture into regional pieces, putting them back together will be extremely difficult.

“The delay was meant to give the industry time to adapt. Instead, it risks creating confusion, competition and complacency. The world isn’t waiting for a decision, it’s moving ahead, one emissions scheme at a time.”",https://decarbonfuse.com/assets/favi/favicon-32x32-b1c94ae87840c662751403aefa5b6ea92417e97aab4cbce5a1b99c4e112cac36.png,N,,2025-12-03 13:58:07.581817

During this year’s London International Shipping Week, ABS chairman and chief executive Christopher Wiernicki urged the maritime industry to approach innovation through a single guiding question: “Does it make us safer?”

That principle has driven one of the classification society’s latest technical advances: the enhancement of its containership lashing system notation, CLP-V(PARR), to incorporate a seasonality factor. The addition gives boxship operators greater operational flexibility by accounting for variable sea conditions throughout the year.

Safety is just one part of a broader vision. Wiernicki has also called on the maritime sector to seize what he described as a “once-in-a-generation opportunity”: harnessing nuclear power for commercial shipping.

That call is already being backed by action. Two pioneering nuclear projects received Approval in Principle (AiP) from ABS in 2025. The first, developed by South Korea’s HD Korea Shipbuilding & Offshore Engineering, is a 15,000 teu containership concept powered by a molten salt reactor providing heat, paired with a supercritical carbon dioxide system for power generation.

The second project envisions a floating nuclear power barge capable of supporting port facilities or coastal communities from offshore. Expanding this vision even further, ABS has also published a landmark study on floating nuclear power data centres, proposing designs that could help meet surging energy demands from artificial intelligence and cloud computing.

Beyond nuclear, ABS continues to explore a range of alternative fuel paths. In partnership with the European Maritime Safety Agency, it led two studies examining the potential of synthetic fuels such as e-diesel, e-methane and e-methanol.

To support industry adoption, ABS has also released two key advisories: Dual-Fuel Solutions for Newbuild Vessels, a comprehensive review of dual-fuel propulsion options pairing traditional hydrocarbons with liquefied natural gas, methanol or ammonia; and Safety Insights for Ammonia as a Marine Fuel, which explores ammonia’s onboard performance and risk profile.

Addressing the growing risk of electric vehicle battery fires on board vehicle carriers, ABS has developed advanced simulation models of lithium-ion thermal runaway, providing new insight to strengthen firefighting strategies and vessel design.

Wiernicki is set to retire at the end of 2025, after 14 years at the helm of ABS. He will be replaced by president and chief operating officer John McDonald.

02 / Knut Ørbeck-Nilssen, DNV

In DNV’s latest Maritime Forecast to 2050, Knut Ørbeck-Nilssen, chief executive of DNV Maritime, paints a picture of an industry in transformation, driven by regulation, technology and collaboration on an unprecedented scale.

While the heart of the forecast — the International Maritime Organization’s approval of the Net-Zero Framework — ultimately was postponed, DNV continues to call for urgent action to finalise certification frameworks for sustainable fuels.

Equally important is ensuring that early adopters are rewarded, believes DNV. Clear incentive mechanisms for zero and near-zero fuels, as well as for efficiency and carbon-saving technologies, are essential to sustain industry confidence.

According to data from DNV’s Alternative Fuels Insight platform, the number of vessels being delivered with alternative-fuel capabilities is set to more than double by 2028.

By 2030, these ships could consume about 50m tonnes of non-oil fuels annually — a big step toward the IMO’s target of reducing emissions by 20% by the end of the decade.

The report notes that competition for low-emission fuels will be fierce, which will intensify the need for cross-sector coordination and investment in green fuel production.

While the fuel transition will take time, DNV stresses that energy efficiency offers immediate opportunities for impact. Advances in wind-assisted propulsion, digital optimisation and onboard carbon capture prove that multiple solutions can work together to cut emissions.

Research in this year’s report shows that installing carbon capture systems on large containerships, tankers and bulk carriers is technically feasible, with manageable space requirements. If combined with CO2 offloading infrastructure at key ports, such retrofits could reduce global fleet emissions by nearly 9%, noted DNV.

03 / Hayato Suga, ClassNK

The year 2025 was a significant one for ClassNK, as Hayato Suga took over the president and chief executive role at the Japanese class society in March, replacing Hiroaki Sakashita, who became chairman.

Suga brings with him four decades of experience within the organisation and has set a clear vision for ClassNK that include responding to the evolving needs of the shipping industry at a time when environmental imperatives and digitalisation are blurring the boundaries between maritime and other sectors.

His priorities centre on expanding the society’s service portfolio and fostering a culture of initiative-driven innovation across the organisation.

One of the year’s key milestones was the opening of ClassNK’s new Tech Expertise Centre in Piraeus, Greece. The centre is designed to provide comprehensive technical support extending beyond traditional survey activities, reinforcing the society’s presence in one of the world’s leading maritime hubs.

Throughout 2025, ClassNK continued to diversify its activities beyond conventional classification, engaging with emerging technologies, alternative fuels, emissions-based certification and smart ship innovations.

The society also advanced its technically based “endorsement” methodology, enabling certification in advance for new technologies and solutions before their widespread adoption.

In addition, it expanded its analytical and advisory tools, complementing its growing Alternative Fuels Insights report portfolio with the introduction of the ClassNK Fleet Cost Simulation service.

This new tool enables shipowners and operators to evaluate the financial impacts of upcoming regulatory measures, including FuelEU Maritime and the EU Emissions Trading System.

04 / Nick Brown, Lloyd’s Register

Lloyd’s Register marked a milestone year in 2025 by returning to its historic London headquarters at 71 Fenchurch Street, following a comprehensive refurbishment. The reopening ceremony was honoured by a royal visit from Her Royal Highness The Princess Royal, coinciding with London International Shipping Week in September.

Earlier in the year, LR unveiled its newly structured LR Advisory Service, bringing together more than 250 global experts to provide integrated business and technical advisory support.

The service aims to help the maritime sector accelerate progress in decarbonisation, digital transformation, regulatory adaptation and operational performance.

At LISW 2025, LR introduced its Biofuel Advisory Service, offering targeted guidance for shipowners, bunker suppliers and fuel producers navigating the evolving landscape of biofuel adoption.

Reinforcing its leadership in next-generation maritime energy, LR also announced an AI-driven partnership with Microsoft to streamline permitting and licensing processes for maritime nuclear applications — a key contribution to a global cross-industry pledge to triple nuclear energy capacity by 2050.

Across the year, LR delivered transformative milestones in alternative fuels, wind propulsion and antifouling innovation, including the classification of the world’s first wind-assisted aframax tanker.

Under chief executive Nick Brown, LR’s influence continued to grow across major market sectors, highlighted by the launch of its Cruise Ship Centre of Expertise, which integrates classification, advisory and digital services to enhance cruise safety, efficiency and sustainability.

The year also saw the release of the Global Maritime Trends 2025 Barometer, produced jointly with the Lloyd’s Register Foundation. The report provides a data-driven view of the industry’s progress toward digitalisation and decarbonisation, warning that without coordinated international regulation, progress risks fragmentation.

05 / Zhao Yan, China Classification Society

Zhao Yan, who assumed the role of chairman and president of the China Classification Society in April 2025, following the retirement of Sun Feng, is steering the organisation through a transformative year, marked by significant strides in decarbonisation, digitalisation and global expansion.

The CCS is continuing to position itself as a key player in the transition toward a greener, smarter and more connected global shipping industry.

In October, the CCS released its landmark China Sustainable Shipping Fuel Development Report 2025, an analysis of global and domestic greenhouse gas-reduction policies and future trends in sustainable marine fuels.

The report explores pathways for the adoption of green hydrogen, methanol, ammonia and biofuels, aiming to guide policy makers and industry leaders in building a robust low-carbon fuel supply chain.

A technological milestone came in July 2025, when the CCS provided newbuilding class provision for the world’s first methanol dual-fuel, low-speed marine diesel engine for a very large crude carrier.

During the North Bund International Shipping Forum, the society hosted the Digital and Intelligent Forum, underscoring the importance of data-driven technologies and automation in enhancing the industry’s productivity and safety.

To bolster its international service capabilities, the CCS launched the International Ship Business Operation Centre in Shanghai, providing integrated, full-lifecycle services for global clients. The initiative marks a strategic step in expanding the CCS’s reach in the international maritime market.

The CCS further demonstrated its global engagement by participating as an international partner at London International Shipping Week, where it showcased its contributions to global maritime safety, sustainability and innovation.

In another milestone, the Zhoushan Office of CCS oversaw the successful delivery of the world’s largest ultra-low temperature refrigerated cargoships. The 9,000 dwt vessels can maintain temperatures as low as -55°C for the transport of high-value seafood such as tuna.

06 / Matthieu de Tugny, Bureau Veritas

Bureau Veritas’ marine and offshore division continues to help accelerate the industry’s transition toward a sustainable lower-carbon future.

Through its collaboration with shipowners, operators and technology pioneers, BV is enabling the deployment of next-generation technologies designed to cut emissions and reshape the global shipping landscape.

As a thought leader in maritime sustainability, BV president Matthieu de Tugny released his latest book, Towards a Sustainable Blue Economy, in 2025.

The book calls for systemic change in how the maritime industry is funded, fuelled and operated — urging collaboration between financial, regulatory and technical stakeholders to drive pragmatic, collective progress toward net zero emissions.

The classification society has issued several AiPs for cutting-edge projects, including the HavHyS project, advancing liquid hydrogen and ammonia fuel cell technology, in partnership with Malaysian shipowner MISC Group, and supporting the expansion of ammonia bunkering newbuildings in a partnership with Japan’s Sasaki Shipbuilding.

BV has also facilitated the integration of multiple green fuel and wind propulsion solutions across a diverse range of newbuildings, including the sail-powered ro-ro cargoship Neoliner Origin (IMO: 1021829), which entered service in October.

Reflecting its leadership in alternative fuels, BV maintains a 30% market share in LNG bunkering vessels and has classed the world’s first ammonia bunkering vessel, while BV is also the leading class society for methanol bunkering vessels.

BV Asia-Pacific senior vice-president Alex Gregg-Smith will take over the president role of the marine and offshore division in early 2026.

07 / Hyung-chul Lee, Korean Register

At Gastech 2025, the KR and HD Hyundai Samho announced they are developing a water-circulated, double-wall ammonia fuel pipe system to prevent leakage and enhance safety on ammonia-fuelled ships, with plans to propose related safety standards to the IMO.

The KR has formed a joint working group with key South Korea shipbuilders to establish international standards for ammonia effluent discharge, addressing environmental safety and regulatory gaps for ammonia-fuelled vessels.

08 / Paolo Moretti, Rina

Rina unveiled several landmark initiatives and collaborations in 2025 that advance shipping’s journey toward net zero emissions.

In partnership with Italian energy major ENI and shipbuilding group Fincantieri, Rina co-presented the Sustainable Maritime Transport Outlook, a strategic study aimed at accelerating the decarbonisation of maritime transport in line with the Net-Zero 2050 target.

The study outlines practical paths and collaborative frameworks for reducing emissions across the maritime value chain.

Led by chief executive Paulo Moretti, Rina also played a key role as the classification society for Atal Solutions’ retrofitting project, a transformative initiative carried out with Damen Shipyards and Blue Astra Maritime.

The project involves upgrading four bulk carriers with next-generation technologies designed to cut emissions, reduce fuel consumption by more than 25%, and nearly eliminate vessel waste, setting a new benchmark for sustainable ship retrofits.

Further strengthening its role in innovation, Rina granted AiP for a next-generation ultramax bulker design developed by Chinese ship designer Shanghai Design and Research Institute and Greek shipowner Almi Marine. The design features dual-fuel LNG/hydrogen propulsion, battery-assisted systems and an innovative hydrogen-reforming solution.

Rina awarded AiP to Korea Maritime Consultants for a 40,000 cu m LNG-fuelled, hydrogen-ready, liquid CO2 carrier, supporting the advancement of carbon capture, utilisation and storage logistics. The vessel’s flexible and scalable design represents a key step toward building the maritime infrastructure required for a cost-effective net zero transition.

Looking beyond individual projects, Rina is expanding its innovation ecosystem with the establishment of seven Open Innovation Hubs across the globe. These hubs will serve as collaborative spaces for idea exchange, solution testing and addressing shared industry challenges.

As emissions rise globally, international bodies including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) highlight that cutting emissions alone is no longer enough to limit temperature increases to 1.5°C.

Technologies that prevent or remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere are forming a vital part of the global response.

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) offers a practical solution for sectors where decarbonisation is difficult, helping to prevent vast volumes of CO₂ from entering the atmosphere.

“It can also be used to generate low-carbon power by gas power stations with carbon capture and storage as well as enabling hydrogen power.

“These sources of power are important for when the sun isn’t shining and the wind isn’t blowing.”

According to National Grid, CCS focuses on emissions from power generation and industrial processes such as cement, steel and hydrogen production.

Once captured, CO₂ is transported by pipeline, road or ship and injected deep into geological formations for permanent storage.

Suitable storage sites include saline aquifers and depleted oil or gas reservoirs, which must sit at least 1km underground.

CCUS focuses not only on storing CO₂ but also on converting it into useful products including plastics, concrete or biofuel.

“Scaling CCU could be an economic opportunity while offering an additional path to abate CO₂ emissions,” said Fernando Gómez, Head of the Future of Materials at the World Economic Forum.

“With credible policy signals, long-term investment and cross-sector partnerships, CO₂ could mature from a liability into an asset creating new market value while accelerating industrial decarbonization.”

How does CCS work?

CCS follows a three stage process and according to industry body the Global CCS Institute, CCS is a proven technology that has been in safe operation for more than 45 years.

Capture

CO₂ is separated from other gases produced by industrial activity, including steelworks, cement plants and coal or natural-gas-fired power stations.

Capture methods vary depending on the facility but generally purify CO₂ so it can be economically transported.

Transport

After separation, the CO₂ is compressed into a liquid and dehydrated, then transported to a storage location.

Large-scale CO₂ transport already takes place globally via pipelines, tanks and shipping routes.

Storage

Finally, the CO₂ is injected into deep rock formations at depths of one kilometre or more.

These formations are similar to those that have trapped oil and gas for millions of years, providing long-term containment.

“CCUS provides the lowest cost pathway to reaching net zero which is why the independent Climate Change Committee has declared it a ‘necessity, not an option,’ says Chris Stark, former CEO at the Climate Change Committee and Head of Mission Control for Clean Power 2030 at the Department of Energy Security & Net Zero.

""CCUS gives a range of options to decarbonise that would otherwise not be possible and it minimises the climate warming emissions released to the atmosphere on our journey to net zero.

""It will be an important part of our industrial future.”

What are the benefits of carbon capture and storage?

The IPCC’s latest assessment identifies CCS as a critical mitigation option, particularly in heavy industrial sectors where alternative solutions are limited.

By preventing CO₂ from reaching the atmosphere, CCS could offer immediate and significant reductions in emissions that would otherwise be extremely difficult to avoid.

According to the International Maritime Organization: ""CCS can be combined with bioenergy (BECCS) to reduce harmful emissions, effectively removing CO₂ from the atmosphere. This combination is vital for scenarios that limit global warming to 1.5°C or 2°C.""

“CCUS technologies are critical to put energy systems around the world on a sustainable path,” says Mathilde Fajardy, Energy Technology & Policy Analyst at the International Energy Agency.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/55cf22ac9165ba834e702a841c7721ec:a47fa833634e6e787047d823c8c5688c/carbon-capture.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-12-02 11:56:46.493265

Meloni also said that 'the transport sector has often been affected by European choices that are more ideological than pragmatic. The ecological transition is an objective that we obviously share, but it must be compatible with reality, with companies' timeframes and with technological neutrality'.

Alis represents 2,450 members, 476,000 workers and 150 billion euros in aggregate turnover. And in recent months companies of the calibre of Ita Airways, Leonardo, Enav and Trenitalia have joined Alis.

The IMO Assembly is the highest governing body of the Organization, convened every two years. All IMO member states participate to determine policies and operational budgets for the next two years. Key items on the A34 agenda included electing member states to the IMO Council (the executive body) for the 2026–2027 term, and adopting major resolutions related to maritime safety, marine environmental protection, maritime security, and other legal issues proposed by IMO’s committees.

The Assembly also approved IMO’s strategy, budget, and work plan for 2026–2027, as well as presented awards such as the International Maritime Prize and IMO Honours for Exceptional Bravery at Sea.

At the opening ceremony, Sang delivered a statement reaffirming Vietnam’s strong commitment to IMO priorities, including maritime safety, environmental protection, greenhouse gas emission reduction, and sustainable maritime development. During the session, he also met with IMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez.

He emphasised that Vietnam highly values IMO’s central role in maintaining a safe, efficient, and sustainable global maritime industry. Since joining IMO in 1984, Vietnam has been an active and responsible member, strictly implementing 24 IMO conventions and related amendments, participating in technical cooperation programmes and projects, and contributing to discussions at IMO’s technical committees.

During the meeting, the IMO Secretary-General praised Vietnam’s achievements in the maritime sector, acknowledged Vietnam’s proposals, and expressed readiness to support the country through technical cooperation activities and by sending IMO experts to assist Vietnam in reviewing and drafting a new Maritime Code.

On the sidelines of A34, the Vietnamese delegation held working sessions with delegations from the United Kingdom and the United States. At the meeting with the UK delegation, both sides discussed potential cooperation areas including maritime transport, inland waterways, and measures to reduce carbon emissions in line with IMO’s green transition goals.

Deputy Minister Sang briefed the UK side on Vietnam’s progress in restructuring administrative agencies in the maritime and inland waterway sectors, as well as ongoing amendments to the Maritime Code and the Law on Inland Waterway Transport. He also expressed interest in learning from the UK’s legislative experience and implementation models.

Keir Alexander Mather, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Aviation, Maritime and Decarbonisation at the UK Department for Transport, praised Vietnam’s reforms and affirmed the UK’s willingness to share experience in maritime and inland waterway legislation and enforcement.

In the meeting with the US delegation, Deputy Minister Sang highlighted notable cooperation achievements, including the Vietnam–US Maritime Transport Agreement (signed March 15, 2007), and ongoing collaboration with the US Coast Guard (USCG) through APEC programmes supporting the implementation of the International Ship and Port Facility Security Code (ISPS Code) since 2006.

“Large container vessels present a unique propulsion challenge,” said WinGD vice president, market development, Benny Hilström. “They demand immense power, exceptional efficiency and long-term fuel flexibility. With the X-DF-HP, we are providing operators with a purpose-built solution for the most power-hungry vessels, offering uncompromised, trouble-free propulsion.”

It is available with the same auxiliary system requirements – such as fuel supply pressure – as other recognised engine concepts.

“The X-DF-HP is built on the high-pressure Diesel X92-B engine platform that has already proven itself as one of the most efficient and reliable large-bore solutions in the container segment,” said WinGD vice president R&D Sebastian Hensel. “Building on our long-standing diesel engine expertise and our deep experience in LNG dual-fuel technology, we’ve developed the X‑DF‑HP. Our tests and simulations show the X-DF-HP will deliver a clear step-up in fuel efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions-reduction performance compared with existing high-pressure dual-fuel engines on the market.”

The X-DF-HP joins the company’s high-pressure, multi-fuel portfolio, which includes the methanol/ethanol-capable X-DF-M/E and ammonia-fuelled X-DF-A engines.

WinGD said, “With LNG providing FuelEU Maritime compliance well into the next decade, and uncertainty remaining around future IMO requirements, LNG continues to offer a cost-competitive, low-risk route to fleet decarbonisation. WinGD’s X-DF (low pressure) and X-DF-HP engines are fully compatible with renewable methane blends, enabling operators to progress towards lower-carbon operations without extensive mechanical modifications or the high retrofitting costs typically associated with emerging fuels.”

“For ultra-large container ships choosing LNG as their pathway to net zero, the X-DF-HP is the most cost-effective option,” added Mr Hilström.
