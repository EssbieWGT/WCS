This results in at least approximately a combined 120,000 metric tonnes (mt) of GHG emissions abated, starting in 2027.
Contracting remains ongoing, and ZEMBA welcomes additional freight buyers to reach out through ZEMBA’s website if interested in joining this deal.
“We applaud Hapag-Lloyd and North Sea Container Line’s leadership, collaboration, and innovation, as well as the quality of their offerings in response to ZEMBA’s pioneering market signal,” said Ingrid Irigoyen, President and CEO of ZEMBA.
“We are proud to be awarded together with Hapag-Lloyd the ZEMBA tender, reaffirming NCL’s commitment to shaping the future of sustainable logistics,” said Bente Hetland, CEO of NCL.","The Zero Emission Maritime Buyers Alliance (ZEMBA) on Wednesday (17 December) announced global container line Hapag-Lloyd and regional feeder North Sea Container Line (NCL) have won ZEMBA’s second tender, enabling ZEMBA’s members to abate ocean transport emissions by deploying two hydrogen-derived e-fuels.

ZEMBA said this was a key milestone in the clean energy transition of the maritime shipping industry as it bolsters two fuel pathways to future-proof this critical sector, supports new economic opportunities around the world, and mitigates the sector’s significant greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

Based on commitments to date, this ground-breaking effort will enable participating member companies, including cofounders Amazon, Patagonia and Tchibo, and members including Beiersdorf, Brooks Running, Green Worldwide Shipping, IKEA, Nike, Poly Medicure Ltd., and Sport-Thieme to deploy e-fuels on an initial 20 billion tonne nautical miles of transport activity over three years, with some members extending to five years.

This results in at least approximately a combined 120,000 metric tonnes (mt) of GHG emissions abated, starting in 2027. Contracting remains ongoing, and ZEMBA welcomes additional freight buyers to reach out through ZEMBA’s website if interested in joining this deal.

Through these deployments, the two winning shipping lines, Hapag-Lloyd and NCL, are redefining what’s possible in this industry:

Hapag-Lloyd will deploy e-methanol on large methanol dual-fuel containerships, on a trans-oceanic lane.

NCL will deploy the world’s first e-ammonia-powered containership, serving a northern European trade lane.

Both fuels will be made with low-carbon hydrogen produced with renewable energy and will deliver a carbon intensity reduction of at least 90% on a lifecycle basis relative to conventional high-emission fuel.

“We applaud Hapag-Lloyd and North Sea Container Line’s leadership, collaboration, and innovation, as well as the quality of their offerings in response to ZEMBA’s pioneering market signal,” said Ingrid Irigoyen, President and CEO of ZEMBA. “This voluntary private sector initiative remains on track to invest in rapid on-the-water deployment of vastly scalable, next-generation maritime fuels.”

“At a time when sourcing scalable e-fuels remains a major challenge for the entire industry, winning the second ZEMBA tender is a significant milestone for us. Deploying e-methanol is an essential step in our journey to reach net-zero fleet operations by 2045. We are very grateful for the trust that all ZEMBA members have placed in our capabilities, and we remain fully committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and contributing to a greener future for global shipping,” said Rolf Habben Jansen, CEO of Hapag-Lloyd.

“We are proud to be awarded together with Hapag-Lloyd the ZEMBA tender, reaffirming NCL’s commitment to shaping the future of sustainable logistics,” said Bente Hetland, CEO of NCL. “With a dedicated product for ZEMBA’s members who are ready to drive real change, NCL will continue to push the transition towards next generation maritime fuels. We are truly grateful for the strong support from the business community as we work together to deliver efficient and forward-thinking transport solutions.”

Following ZEMBA’s novel inaugural tender in 2024, ZEMBA’s second procurement focused on kickstarting a new market for scalable, low-carbon hydrogen-derived e-fuels that will be essential to achieve an economically viable whole-of-sector maritime clean energy transition.

Just as global renewable energy costs have declined significantly in recent years as the market has matured, e-methanol and e-ammonia that are produced with clean energy offer great potential for economies of scale. With this announcement, ZEMBA’s first-mover members are demonstrating support for scalable, strategic, and holistic supply chain sustainability solutions that can enable them to meet long-term goals.

This latest announcement also reinforces the importance of credible, third-party verified, and transparent book and claim chain of custody systems to activate early voluntary corporate demand and create markets for new technology solutions.

For highly distributed global sectors like ocean transportation, these systems enable demand from buyers around the world to flow to first-mover suppliers that are ready for deployment, irrespective of geographic availability constraints that would otherwise render such commercial arrangements impossible.

Ofiniti, the company behind the FuelBoss digital delivery platform and BunkerFlow, recently said it has completed more than 24,000 digital bunker operations across its network this year.

In its Impact Report 2025, Ofiniti said 2025 was the year digitalisation and decarbonisation truly converged in bunkering.

“Alternative fuels are moving from pilot stage to scaled supply, biofuels, LNG, methanol, ammonia, but they bring complexity, documentation demands and safety requirements that manual processes cannot handle,” the company said.

“That is where Ofiniti quietly became infrastructure. Before electronic Bunker Delivery Notes were mandated in Singapore or widely discussed across the industry, we had already begun digitising operations in North-West Europe.

“What is now becoming a global expectation began as a practical response to operational friction, making documentation clearer, aligning stakeholders, and reducing manual burden.”

With Ofiniti’s capability to support LNG, methanol, biofuels and ammonia, the company said its suppliers delivered 500,000 metric tonnes (mt) of alternative marine fuels, equivalent to filling 200 Olympic pools, this year.

Ofiniti also said its first deliveries of 100% bio-LNG and B100 UCOME were also completed and documented digitally in 2025.

With alternative fuels, the company said the stack of documents grows with more comprehensive checklists and documentation of the lifecycle emission profile and FuelBoss can automate that process.

“It standardises the process, gives every stakeholder the same data, and creates the digital custody chain required to validate the sustainability of new fuels,” it added.

With that, Ofiniti has reduced paperwork by an average of 28 pages per LNG delivery.

Looking ahead, Tue Nielsen, CEO of Ofiniti, said: “The next phase of the energy transition is not only about new fuel molecules; it is about proof, integrity, safety, and interoperability.

“Ofiniti is positioned as the system that enables these flows, the unseen operating layer that lets the energy transition actually work at scale.”

Singapore-based maritime electrification startup Pyxis on Wednesday (17 December) said it has secured SGD 13 million (USD 10 million) in the first close of its SGD 18 million growth funding round.

The early close underscores rising investor conviction in Pyxis’ technology and commercial progress, reinforced by continued support from Singapore government agencies such as the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) and SEEDS, which operates under SG Growth Capital, the investment platform of the Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB) and Enterprise Singapore Pyxis’ fund raise comes at a time marked by an increased demand for electric vessels across Asia.

The region operates more than 70,000 coastal and in-port vessels while Singapore alone expects some 1,600 harbour crafts to transition to electric or low-carbon alternatives as part of the broader national goals.

Pyxis’ electric vessels and energy systems address this need directly – reducing the total cost of ownership (TCO) by lowering both fuel and maintenance expenses, while significantly improving energy efficiency and cutting emissions.

Powered by Electra™, the company’s proprietary energy and vessel management platform, Pyxis enables real-time monitoring, predictive maintenance and fleet-level optimisation, improved reliability and reduced downtime.

To date, the company has secured 17 orders for electric vessels across multiple customers in the region, including Singapore. Concurrently, Pyxis is developing a network of ultra-fast marine charging sites, with two charging locations deployed and additional sites planned in partnership with local stakeholders. An upcoming 300KW charger location will also be launched in Q1 2026. With these deployments, Pyxis is entering its strongest growth chapter since inception.

The financing round is backed by a strong coalition of climate-tech, venture capital, and maritime strategic investors, with follow-on commitments from Shift4Good, Motion Ventures, the world’s largest maritime tech fund, and SG Growth Capital, underscoring the sustained confidence of Pyxis’ long-term partners. It also includes participation from strategic backers including Mitsui O.S.K. Lines, one of the world’s largest shipping companies, through its corporate venture capital arm, MOL PLUS.

The raise was catalysed by the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA)’s Expression of Interest (EOI) for electric vessel financing, which was part of Singapore’s broader maritime decarbonisation and innovation efforts to build an electric harbour craft ecosystem that supports early adopters of new electric solutions.

In addition to equity financing, Pyxis has secured green debt financing from OCBC, strengthening its capacity to scale vessel deployment and infrastructure development. This financing, to be channelled toward vessel capital expenditure, will provide capital flexibility essential for accelerating commercial rollout.

“Investor conviction in this round sends an unmistakable message: maritime electrification is accelerating, and Pyxis is leading that transition,” said Tommy Phun, Founder and CEO of Pyxis.

“The strength of this first close, anchored by strategic follow-on investments, validates the scalability of our technology and our ambition to build Asia’s leading coastal electrification ecosystem.”

“Two years ago, Pyxis was a bold vision with a great team behind it. Today, that vision is moving fast across the water: 17 vessels secured, charging infrastructure rolling out, Electra™ evolving into a true operating system for electric fleets, and international expansion underway,” said Sebastien Guillard, Co-founder and Managing Partner of Shift4Good.

“Few companies execute with this clarity and pace. We’re proud to back Pyxis again and support their rise as the leader of Asia’s coastal electrification wave.”

“SEEDS is proud to continue backing Pyxis, a fast-growing company with a capable team and strong strategic partnerships, together with our co-investment partner Shift4Good. We look forward to seeing Pyxis advance its solutions and contribute to the maritime electrification landscape in the region,” said Tan Kaixin, General Manager of SEEDS.

The biofuel corridor represents an additional element in the company's decarbonisation approach.","Odfjell has begun operating what it describes as the first operational green corridor between Brazil and Europe, using certified sustainable biofuel on a 5,000-nautical-mile route.

The Norwegian chemical tanker operator is running 12 to 15 voyages annually along the route, each lasting around 40 days, using a B24 sustainable biofuel blend sourced from Rio Grande.

The initiative is entirely self-funded, with Odfjell covering the additional fuel costs without subsidies or external financial support.

""By covering the additional cost ourselves, we eliminate the financial element and move directly into operational implementation,"" says Harald Fotland, the company's CEO.

The B24 blend comprises 24% renewable biodiesel derived from waste and 76% very-low-sulphur oil.

How the green corridor works

Odfjell has secured an offtake agreement for the B24 blend in Rio Grande to ensure long-term fuel availability.

The Ports of Antwerp-Bruges, Rotterdam and Rio Grande are collaborating with Odfjell to improve efficiency and optimise port-stay processes along the corridor.

""We do this to demonstrate that certified fuel, technology and infrastructure are already available,"" Harald explains.

""Through this, we show that sustainable biofuel is a viable option for deep-sea shipping today.""

The company emphasised this represents a sustained operational commitment rather than a one-off demonstration project.

A well supported initiative

The Norwegian Minister of Climate and Environment, Andreas Bjelland Eriksen, welcomed the initiative as an important milestone.

""We congratulate Odfjell on taking the lead and demonstrating what is possible when business and public authorities cooperate across national borders to reduce emissions,"" he says.

""Green shipping corridors over long distances are still in their early stages, and this therefore represents an important first step on the path toward zero emissions.""

The corridor builds on a 2024 memorandum of understanding between Norway and Brazil to establish a green transatlantic shipping route.

Knut Arild Hareide, who is CEO of the Norwegian Shipowners' Association, sees the launch as a highly encouraging step towards greener logistics.

""That a deep-sea shipping company like Odfjell has succeeded in establishing a regular corridor between Brazil and Europe powered by certified biofuel is both highly encouraging and an important step toward our shared goal of decarbonising global shipping by 2050,"" Knut explains.

Shipping accounts for roughly 3% of global human-made greenhouse gas emissions.

Odfjell's broader decarbonisation strategy

Odfjell has reduced its carbon intensity by more than 54% compared to a 2008 benchmark through various technical and operational measures.

The biofuel corridor represents an additional element in the company's decarbonisation approach.

""With this corridor, we integrate greener fuel as a new pillar in our decarbonisation strategy,"" Harald says.

World’s first two LH₂ bulk carriers, also by LH2 Shipping, received soft funding from Enova earlier this year. This major grant, totalling more than half a billion NOK for the four ships, marks a strong signal for national and global maritime decarbonisation in this segment of the maritime industry where emissions can be achieved at scale. The two companies team up on the NordBulk Project to strengthen their long term, ambitious, decarbonisation agenda.

Strand Shipping Bergen— part of Vertom Group BV — is playing an active role in Vertom’s ambitious decarbonisation agenda, combining local market presence with Vertom’s modern vessel programme and long-term customer partnerships, driving efficient coastal logistics while prioritising rapid emissions reductions.

“Strand Shipping Bergen AS is fortunate to be part of the forward-thinking Vertom Group BV, and this project represents a new chapter in the pursuit of an environmentally sustainable future in shipping, as well as a significant step toward achieving zero emissions. We look forward to continuing our collaboration on this project together with LH2 Shipping”, states Joergen Brandt, Managing Director of Strand Shipping Bergen.

Vertom operates a modern fleet of over 100 vessels, ranging from around 1,500 to 12,000 DWT, across short-sea and multipurpose trades. Strand Shipping Bergen, as part of the Strand Shipping Bergen Norway/Vertom cooperation, has access to the full Vertom fleet (117 vessels in total across the combined group).

“Strand Shipping Bergen with Vertom support is a significant player in short sea shipping, and our combined maritime experience and shared ambitions to develop and offer future-oriented shipping solutions enable us to take important steps to build and operate climate-friendly transport alternatives. Liquid hydrogen is a proven technology aboard M/F Hydra, which is being built upon in the transition to zero emissions in the bulk carrier sector, and we are pleased to collaborate with a leading company like Strand Shipping Bergen,” says CEO of LH2 Shipping, Dr. Ivan Oestvik.

The ENOVA award to the NordBulk Project is part of the support program “Hydrogen in vessels”. “We are very pleased with this award and would like to thank Enova for the support so far from the pre-project phase and now into the construction phase for the first four ships in this segment. This enables us to accelerate the development of emission-free vessels in operation, whilst also ensuring ship operators and cargo owners staying ahead of increasingly strict emissions”, says Oestvik.

Zero-emission shipping

LH2 Shipping has been developing ship concepts for many years and is now stepping up its activities and is currently developing a wide range of zero-emission ship concepts. This creates both a market for LH₂ production and shows that zero-emission maritime transport is both possible and profitable in the long term. These projects are groundbreaking and will accelerate the transition to carbon-free maritime transport – without compromising good operations or safety, while the ships offer range at

sea.

Shortsea shipping has extended experience in the combination of fuel cells and batteries, where the two technologies are working together in hybrid systems where different routes and ship types provides different system combinations. Some routes can be operated 100% on batteries whereas hydrogen driven fuel cells are added where range and charging issues are dominant.

At the workshop, delegates discussed the overall trend of green methanol and Vietnam’s opportunities in the global value chain. The workshop marked an important step forward in efforts to promote the development of low-carbon fuels in Vietnam.

Green methanol trend in the world

In the context of more than 150 countries committing to Net Zero by 2050-2060, the demand for low-carbon fuels has increased sharply on a global scale. The maritime industry is particularly notable as the International Maritime Organization (IMO) aims to reduce emissions by 70% by 2040, leading to an explosion of methanol-powered fleets – expected to double by 2026. Methanol fuel infrastructure at major ports in Asia is developing rapidly. Vietnam is located on a key China – Southeast Asia shipping route, opening up great opportunities to join the green methanol supply chain.

As a pillar energy group of the country, Petrovietnam has identified the energy transition strategy as the central priority. The Group is implementing low-carbon energy development models: green hydrogen, green ammonia, biofuel, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), biomethanol and carbon recovery, use and storage solutions (CCUS); while expanding the clean energy ecosystem and value chain of biomass, agricultural byproducts to meet the requirements of emission reduction. This is a key orientation to contribute to the realization of Vietnam’s Net Zero 2050 goal.

Petrovietnam – BASF Cooperation: Creating a foundation for the green methanol industry in Vietnam

At the program, Petrovietnam and BASF shared the orientation of cooperation in researching and developing green methanol on the basis of taking advantage of the abundant biomass resources, especially in the Mekong Delta, along with Petrovietnam’s complete oil and gas – chemical infrastructure. BASF brings leading technology expertise, global experience in the methanol value chain and in-depth understanding of international carbon policies and standards.

The sustainable development strategy of Ca Mau Fertilizer (PVCFC) focuses on integrating ESG (Environment, Society and Governance) factors, focusing on farmers, building a digital agricultural ecosystem and optimizing resources (air), towards the goal of green growth, improving competitiveness, and bringing benefits to the community.

In 2024, the enterprise reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 4.45%, energy consumption intensity by 5.48%, and water use by 2.02% compared to 2023, and in the 2023-2025 period, the unit planted more than 300,000 trees to restore ecology. In particular, the initiative to reuse CO2 to produce food CO2 has made Ca Mau Fertilizer one of the first enterprises in the industry to orient the development of a circular economic model, reduce emissions, optimize resources and increase product value. At the same time, the company develops Urea bio, microbiotics, organic and mineral products, aiming to balance inorganic and organic, improve soil, protect water resources, and contribute to building a green agricultural sector.

The proactive participation of PVCFC in this dialogue demonstrates the role of domestic enterprises ready to contribute practical expertise, operational data, market understanding and ESG vision – all towards the common goal of sustainable development and Net Zero 2050.

Policy gaps and the need to improve the legal framework

Experts from the Institute of Energy (Ministry of Industry and Trade), universities and businesses point out that Vietnam currently lacks a clear legal framework for low-carbon fuels such as methanol, ammonia, green hydrogen; especially fuel quality standards, product life cycle assessments (LCA), price mechanisms, financial incentives and carbon markets.

The completion of these policies will facilitate Vietnam’s participation in the regional green methanol value chain, while reducing trade risks in the context of international mechanisms such as the European Southern Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM EU) gradually being widely applied.

Green methanol is not only a new product, but a strategic foundation for Vietnam’s energy and low-carbon chemicals industry. With rich Biomass resources, favorable geographical location, available industrial infrastructure and a strong determination to shift energy, Vietnam is fully qualified to become a new green methanol center of Asia.

Infographic: Polar Fuels Can Reduce the Impact of Black Carbon on the Arctic

The Clean Arctic Alliance welcomes the submission of a proposal (PPR 13-6-1) to the International Maritime Organization (IMO) that aims to establish a fuel measure under MARPOL Annex VI that would reduce the impact of black carbon emissions from international shipping on the Arctic.

The proposal to establish an Arctic fuel measure has been submitted by four IMO member states to a meeting of the IMO’s Pollution Prevention and Response committee (PPR 13), which will take place in February 2026. Regulation of fuels suitable for use in the Arctic means moving to cleaner marine fuels which emit less black carbon, and thus contribute less to Arctic warming. The geographical area to which a proposal would be relevant remains to be determined.

Dr Sian Prior, Lead Advisor to the Clean Arctic Alliance said:

“The Clean Arctic Alliance welcomes the proposal for an Arctic fuel measure which, if agreed upon during February’s IMO meeting, will have positive benefits for both the Arctic and the global climate, as well as provide positive health benefits for Arctic communities. It is important that other Arctic and climate-vulnerable states step up to support the proposal during the discussions at PPR 13 – action to reduce emissions of super-pollutant black carbon is essential for remaining in line with the Paris climate targets and will be an important first step towards reducing international shipping’s climate impact.”

Global container line Hapag-Lloyd and regional operator North Sea Container Line won ZEMBA’s second tender, announced Wednesday, enabling member companies to reduce ocean transport emissions through scalable alternative fuels.

According to ZEMBA, the deployment will cover an initial 20 billion tonne nautical miles of transport activity over three years, with some members extending to five years, resulting in at least approximately 120,000 metric tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions abated starting in 2027. Member companies participating in the initiative include Amazon, Patagonia, Tchibo, Beiersdorf, Brooks Running, IKEA, Nike, and others.

Under the arrangement, Hapag-Lloyd will deploy e-methanol on large methanol dual-fuel containerships operating on trans-oceanic lanes, while North Sea Container Line will deploy the world’s first e-ammonia-powered containership serving a northern European trade lane. Both fuels will be produced using low-carbon hydrogen from renewable energy sources and are designed to deliver a carbon intensity reduction of at least 90% on a lifecycle basis compared to conventional high-emission fuel.

“We applaud Hapag-Lloyd and North Sea Container Line’s leadership, collaboration, and innovation, as well as the quality of their offerings in response to ZEMBA’s pioneering market signal,” said Ingrid Irigoyen, President and CEO of ZEMBA. “This voluntary private sector initiative remains on track to invest in rapid on-the-water deployment of vastly scalable, next-generation maritime fuels.”

The award comes just days after Hapag-Lloyd ordered eight dual-fuel methanol containerships at Chinese shipbuilder CIMC Raffles to in a deal valued at more than USD 500 million, marking the company’s first newbuild project utilizing the fuel. The 4,500 TEU vessels are scheduled for delivery in 2028 and 2029, and will feature state-of-the-art dual-fuel methanol engines capable of achieving up to 30 percent greater efficiency than older ships in the same size class. When operating on methanol propulsion, the fleet is expected to save up to 350,000 metric tons of CO2e annually.

Hapag-Lloyd’s current fleet includes 37 dual-fuel LNG ships either in operation or planned, with the ability to also run on biomethane.

“At a time when sourcing scalable e-fuels remains a major challenge for the entire industry, winning the second ZEMBA tender is a significant milestone for us. Deploying e-methanol is an essential step in our journey to reach net-zero fleet operations by 2045,” said Rolf Habben Jansen, CEO of Hapag-Lloyd.

Bente Hetland, CEO of North Sea Container Line, expressed similar commitment. “We are proud to be awarded together with Hapag-Lloyd the ZEMBA tender, reaffirming NCL’s commitment to shaping the future of sustainable logistics. With a dedicated product for ZEMBA’s members who are ready to drive real change, NCL will continue to push the transition towards next generation maritime fuels.”

This second procurement follows ZEMBA’s inaugural tender in 2024, which focused on waste-based biomethane and was also awarded to Hapag-Lloyd. The latest tender specifically targets hydrogen-derived e-fuels to kickstart a new market for scalable, low-carbon alternatives essential for achieving an economically viable maritime clean energy transition.

The announcement reinforces the role of credible, third-party verified book and claim chain of custody systems in activating early voluntary corporate demand for new technology solutions. ZEMBA continues its partnership with Katalist, the first nonprofit maritime book and claim system, to enable demand from buyers worldwide to flow to suppliers ready for deployment regardless of geographic constraints.

ZEMBA, which serves as a first-of-its-kind buyers group within the maritime sector, aims to accelerate commercial deployment of clean energy-powered shipping and enable economies of scale beyond what individual freight buyers could accomplish alone. The Aspen Institute Energy and Environment Program serves as the ZEMBA secretariat, with technical and legal support provided by the Center for Green Market Activation, Lloyd’s Register Maritime Decarbonisation Hub, and law firm Pillsbury.

The alliance expects to finalize the full measurable impact of its second tender in 2026 as existing and new members complete contracting with the winning carriers.",https://gcaptain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/AFIF.jpeg,N,,2025-12-17 12:57:13.902628

As she put it, “There is a substantial fuel-availability gap,” which, in turn, affected how much penalty revenue could be collected and redistributed.

Under the IMO-target scenario, even if enough alternative fuel were notionally available, the mechanism might “not manage to collect enough penalty revenue, and then you don’t have the money to reward back,” she said.",https://dvzpv6x5302g1.cloudfront.net/AcuCustom/Sitename/DAM/184/LNGC25_Junlin_Yu_thumbnail1_Thumb.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 07:56:47.035408

The B24 biofuel blend is composed of 24% biofuel derived from waste-based feedstock and 76% VLSFO.

Odfjell stated that its chemical tankers are now sailing the 5,000-nautical-mile corridor with significantly lower emissions. The corridor is expected to serve 12-15 voyages per year, with each round voyage lasting approximately 40 days.

The company is also collaborating with the Ports of Antwerp-Bruges, Rotterdam, and Rio Grande to advance the shipping corridor through increased efficiency and optimised port-stay processes.

Biofuel blends such as B24 are increasingly seen as a practical way to reduce emissions from current shipping fleets, though they are not expected to deliver full decarbonisation.

LNG bunker sales at the Dutch port of Rotterdam, Europe’s largest refueling hub, set a quarterly record in the third quarter of the year at 270,254 cu m, according to the port authority.
“Companies with vessels that have installed dual-fuel, LNG propulsion will have an advantage,” said Guido Cardullo, head of marine at bunker supplier Fratelli Cosulich.
While this year was the first for the FuelEU regulation, traders anticipate a continued uptick in demand for the fuel as EU decarbonization rules become stricter, which could lead to shipowners more widely implementing bio-LNG into their fossil LNG marine fuel use.
“Drop-in biofuels cut ETS costs and FuelEU penalties, creating a powerful incentive to switch,” a spokesperson for marine fuel supplier Peninsula said.","This is part of the COMMODITIES 2026 series, where our reporters bring you key themes that will drive commodities markets in 2026.

Tightening EU rules on greenhouse gas emissions are expected to prompt demand for alternative marine energy, but European suppliers are not necessarily well-positioned to harness the additional requirements due to a complex regulatory landscape.

The EU’s FuelEU Maritime rules on marine energy’s GHG intensity have been in force since January 2025, and Brussels will increase the coverage ratio of maritime emissions from 70% in 2025 to 100% in 2026 under its Emissions Trading System, while also including methane and nitrous oxide in emissions accounting.

Many shipping and bunker industry participants expect shipping companies to consume more LNG and biofuels for compliance requirements, and that their bunkering points will be driven by pricing and logistical needs.

The two fuels are more available than other forms of energy with lower GHG emissions than conventional oil-based fuels, and Albrecht Grell, managing director of consultancy OceanScore, said their popularity will only grow due to increased financial incentives.

Average delivered bunker costs in Rotterdam were $18.3/Gigajoule for LNG, $19/Gj for 0.1%-sulfur marine gasoil and $22.8/Gj for B30 bioblend with 30% used cooking oil methyl ester in intra-EU trades over January-November, according to the Platts bunker cost calculator(opens in a new tab), when the ETS was taken into consideration.

If the 2026 rules were to apply, MGO — the preferred compliance option among conventional fuels in EU waters due to sulfur limits — would be priced at a wide premium to LNG of $1/Gj assuming the ship has a slow-speed, two-stroke engine and a narrower discount to B30 of $3.3/Gj.

“We see an increasing uptake [of the fuels] throughout this year,” Grell told Platts, part of S&P Global Energy. “The increased commercial benefit will help to further support this trend.”

Globally, classification society DNV expects LNG demand from the shipping sector to grow from 906 petajoules in 2024 to 1,032 Pj in 2025 and 1,196 Pj in 2026, and biomass demand to increase from 52.5 Pj in 2024 to 80.4 Pj in 2025 and 115 Pj in 2026.

LNG

Europe’s LNG bunker market has seen strong activity through 2025, buoyed by calmer sentiment in the wider LNG complex, keeping prices competitive aside from FuelEU Maritime.

LNG bunker sales at the Dutch port of Rotterdam, Europe’s largest refueling hub, set a quarterly record in the third quarter of the year at 270,254 cu m, according to the port authority. Volumes were up by 34% from the second quarter and by almost 23% from Q3 2024.

“Companies with vessels that have installed dual-fuel, LNG propulsion will have an advantage,” said Guido Cardullo, head of marine at bunker supplier Fratelli Cosulich.

Despite methane slip worries concerning LNG-powered ships, Bunker Holding’s head of LNG, Edward Glossop, said the inclusion of methane in the ETS accounting from 2026 is “no game changer” for LNG bunkering’s business case.

Total fuel and compliance costs for the worst environmentally performing ship with a four-stroke LNG-fueled engine would still be $120-$150/metric ton lower than one burning MGO in intra-EU trades, according to Glossop’s estimates made when applying the 2026 rules to early-December fuel prices.

“Global LNG supply is of course increasing rapidly, and all forward curves suggest that prices will be even more competitive for the coming years,” said Glossop, adding that the forecast LNG barge tightness has yet to manifest in Europe.

Meanwhile, market participants said bio-LNG bunker demand has also been on the rise, and burning the low-carbon fuel could generate large quantities of FuelEU Maritime surplus units, which could be sold to other shipping companies via a pooling arrangement. Gas supplier Gasum quoted the surplus unit at Eur233/mtCO2e ($270/mtCO2e) on Dec. 15.

While this year was the first for the FuelEU regulation, traders anticipate a continued uptick in demand for the fuel as EU decarbonization rules become stricter, which could lead to shipowners more widely implementing bio-LNG into their fossil LNG marine fuel use.

Low-carbon energy

Conventional ships can only burn biofuels to meet EU compliance requirements, often on a drop-in basis. Bunker trader KPI OceanConnect estimates FuelEU Maritime alone has led to a gain of 600,000-700,000 mt/y in biobunker demand on a B100 basis.

“Drop-in biofuels cut ETS costs and FuelEU penalties, creating a powerful incentive to switch,” a spokesperson for marine fuel supplier Peninsula said.

But Europe’s biobunker markets are facing a shake-up, with the EU’s Renewable Energy Directive III transposed into national laws across member states.

The Netherlands, home to the largest European biobunkering port, Rotterdam, is set to implement an Emission Reduction Units system as part of RED III from Jan. 1, 2026, with regulatory designs that, traders said, could drive up marine biofuel prices.

Further complicating the matter is that Belgium and the Netherlands have planned together to treat UCOME, the most popular feedstock in biobunker fuels, as a fossil fuel under their RED III implementation, but Belgium’s transposition date has not been fully confirmed. In Germany, the international shipping sector is excluded from RED III.

“Predicting what effect RED III will have on the market is tricky,” said Jesper Lindegaard Sorensen, global head of alternative fuels at KPI OceanConnect. “We will have to wait and see.”

Singapore has overtaken Rotterdam as the world’s largest biobunkering hub with its ability to offer more lower prices to container lines in Asia-Europe trades, and Sorensen said the world’s largest bunker port is “the obvious candidate” to take more volumes should Rotterdam’s competitiveness be eroded.

The monthly average delivered bunker price for B30 with 30% UCOME and 70% very low sulfur fuel oil was $709/mt in Singapore in November, and $756/mt in Rotterdam, according to Platts assessments.

For intra-EU trades, other bunker traders said the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp region will remain a top biobunkering center due to a well-established logistics network that allows suppliers to offer grades up to B100, but ports in Spain, Italy, France and Turkey are also increasing their capabilities.

“Other locations are setting up a biofuel supply chain … we will be more diverse,” Cardullo said.

Among other fuels, a growing number of ships that can run on green methanol are hitting the waters, but shipping professionals said their uptake remains constrained by high prices and limited availability.

Shipbroker Braemar estimated 87 methanol-capable ships were in operation as of Dec. 10, while at least another 300 are due for delivery in the coming years.

Meanwhile, green methanol costs three times more than MGO, and its production currently stands at 2.2 million mt/y compared with the 60 million mt/y projected to be required by 2040, according to MPC Containerships.",,N,,2025-12-17 02:57:04.347705

The Valencia-Palma route will be the first green corridor between two Spanish ports.
Meanwhile, the shipping company Odfjell has launched the first operational green corridor between Brazil and Europe with its chemical tankers using certified sustainable biofuel.
The Ports of Antwerp-Bruges, Rotterdam and Rio Grande are working together with Odfjell to advance the green corridor through increased efficiency and optimized port-stay processes.
This new green shipping corridor is the result of Norway’s cooperation with Brazil on more climate-friendly shipping.","Three shipping entities have signed a major agreement last week to develop the first green maritime corridor in Spain. The shipping company Baleària, with a fleet portfolio of ferries/fast ferries, and the ports of Palma and Valencia are teaming up to promote the decarbonisation of the maritime-port sector.

The initiative aims to decarbonisation the sector, with a target to operate with zero emissions on this route by 2030, using biofuels in the two Baleària vessels serving passenger and freight transport along this line.

Baleària plans to decarbonise the Valencia-Palma route by 2030, dedicating two of its ships to this line, equipped with dual-engines that will run entirely on biogas by that year. The company will also install onboard batteries to provide renewable electricity for auxiliary use during navigation, along with OPS connection systems in the ships.

For their part, the port authorities of Valencia and the Balearic Islands, as part of their decarbonisation plans, will accelerate the construction of infrastructures for charging batteries in port, and will explore the availability and development of low-carbon fuel supplies.

The chairman of Baleària, Adolfo Utor, stressed that this is a pioneering project for Spain’s maritime decarbonisation: “It is a sustainable competitive bet, which will be two decades ahead of the goal of zero emissions by 2050. The Valencia-Palma route will be the first green corridor between two Spanish ports. This public-private agreement will mean a significant advance in the mobility of passengers and essential goods between the mainland and the Balearic Islands”.

Baleària is a shipping group in Spain with more than 25 years of history in the maritime transport of passengers, vehicles and goods.

Meanwhile, the shipping company Odfjell has launched the first operational green corridor between Brazil and Europe with its chemical tankers using certified sustainable biofuel.

“We have established an offtake of B24 sustainable biofuel blend in Rio Grande to secure long-term fuel availability,” the company said.

The corridor will operate 12-15 voyages per year, each lasting around 40 days.

The Ports of Antwerp-Bruges, Rotterdam and Rio Grande are working together with Odfjell to advance the green corridor through increased efficiency and optimized port-stay processes.

“We do this to demonstrate that certified fuel, technology, and infrastructure are already available,” highlighted CEO Harald Fotland. “Through this, we show that sustainable biofuel is a viable option for deep-sea shipping today.”

Fotland emphasized that this is not a one-off demonstration but a long-term commitment.

The Norwegian minister of climate and environment, Anders Bjelland Eriksen, stated: “We congratulate Odfjell on taking the lead and demonstrating what is possible when business and public authorities cooperate across national borders to reduce emissions.

“Green shipping corridors over long distances are still in their early stages, and this therefore represents an important first step on the path toward zero emissions. The ocean is the link in trade between Brazil and Norway. This new green shipping corridor is the result of Norway’s cooperation with Brazil on more climate-friendly shipping. We will continue this work with the aim that more vessels can gradually adopt a wider range of low- and zero-emission fuels.”",https://shippingtelegraph.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/BALEARIA-DECEMBER.jpeg,N,,2025-12-17 02:57:08.876158

In April, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) provisionally endorsed a world first industry-wide carbon-pricing mechanism for the maritime sector, the Net-Zero Framework (Framework).

In October, a vote on adoption of the Framework was dramatically and unexpectedly postponed.

A new picture is emerging where the underlying momentum remains, but regulatory timelines and price reference points are hazy. The potential implications for the shipping industry remain profound.

What you need to do

In the face of the regulatory uncertainty and market developments, the approach of industry players should be:

Data driven: accurate emissions data is key to managing both risks and opportunities so establish a single source of truth for activity and fuel data across fleets, align data definitions (eg, fuel types, LHV, density, cargo metrics) and incorporate near-real-time visibility of emissions drivers (eg, speed, weather routing, hull condition, engine load). In this way, gain visibility over abatement opportunities. Commercial software solutions are there to support this process.

Flexible: an agile approach is essential to respond adequately to market and regulatory developments. Shipowners can, for example, undertake current state assessments to identify the portion of their fleet that will be captured by legislation, the expectations of key customers and stakeholders and commercial arrangements that come up for renewal. The information can be integrated into scenario planning, regulatory playbooks and risk controls.

Strategic: a strategic approach that blends operational measures, retrofits, and selective newbuilds aligned to multiple fuel pathways is vital, prioritising fuel-flexible and upgrade-ready vessels and technologies to hedge technology and policy uncertainty.

Collaborative: given dependency on new technologies for net-zero aligned emission reductions of shipping, shipping companies and stakeholders should work together to develop low-carbon pathways and enhance emission transparency. Ecosystem collaboration via coalitions (eg, Getting to Zero Coalition, First Mover Coalition) or green corridor initiatives (62 as of 30 October 20241) will aggregate zero or net-zero fuel demand and secure early access to alternative bunkering.

Industry Impact and Strategic Considerations

A global carbon price would have a direct impact on freight costs. Existing global and regional regulatory regimes are already adding compliance cost for charterers and cargo owners. Are these charges a fuel cost - or a function of the profile of the ship as a capital asset? The philosophical divide is most acute in longer term chartering.

Regional schemes, such as the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) already and the impending UK ETS expanding to include maritime emissions from 1 July 2026, have more stringent requirements than those proposed by the IMO. Regional schemes may be affirmed, and new schemes emerge, rather than all such schemes being under pressure to yield to an IMO global scheme.

Owners still need to weigh the costs and benefits of retrofitting existing vessels and of investing in newbuilds designed for low-carbon operation. These equations are nuanced according to ships' trading patterns. Discerning price elasticity in freight markets has been complicated as a result of geopolitical trade uncertainty.

The compliance and penalty history of vessels will still become a factor in asset valuation and due diligence, particularly in the second-hand market. It remains to be seen how strongly IMO's existing short term measures will be enforced in practice. A patchy global compliance picture could attract more polluting assets to low or no enforcement regions.

The need for robust scenario modelling, investment in new technologies, and close engagement with supply chain partners is as pressing as ever, and extends beyond fuel and engine choices to carbon capture, carbon offsetting and to ports that must determine upon new bunkering facilities and fuel sources.

The future of the Framework can play out in a few different ways

In the lead-up to the next vote, technical work continues within the IMO, with ongoing development of guidelines to support the Framework. So does dialogue, consensus building and detailed implementation planning. Industry bodies such as Maritime Industry Australia Limited have expressed disappointment at the delay but see the opportunity to refine the Framework, eliminate areas of uncertainty and improve the eventual regime. At organisations such as the Global Centre for Maritime Decarbonisation (GCMD), pilots and studies continue at pace. GCMD acknowledges the incremental nature of such a complex transition, and the need for holistic engagement across the commercial maritime ecosystem.

Scenarios ahead include:

Eventual adoption: after a year of negotiations, IMO member states manage to reach consensus and formally adopt the Framework at the next IMO session. A consistent, binding global regime for emissions regulation is seen to reward early movers and drives investments in low-carbon technologies. Some industry actors must confront the impact of stricter requirements sooner.

Further delays: consensus remains elusive in 2026, leading to further regulatory fragmentation. Individual countries or regions continue to implement their own rules, including levies. A global patchwork elevates compliance risks, massively increases administrative work, and starts to distort global trade routes as operators avoid or price up sectors with stricter regimes. The incentive is generally to postpone investment or adopt a minimum-compliance approach.

Status quo: while formal adoption is stalled, work on technical guidelines and voluntary measures continues within the IMO and among industry alliances. Some leading shipowners may set and pursue more ambitious emission reduction targets, supported by purpose-driven finance, or under customer pressure. ""Free riders” undermine collective impact and climate ambitions. Uncertainty dampens sector-wide investments and slows the deployment of transformative solutions.

In summary, while eventual global adoption remains possible, persistent uncertainty increases the risk of fragmented regulation, market distortions, and delayed investments; unless strong diplomatic and technical progress bridges the current divides during 2026.

Where does this leave shipping decarbonisation currently

For shipowners, investors, freight users and fuel suppliers, strategy depends on their view of the below factors:

Local regulation

Some policymakers and regions may use the interim period to develop their own standards and incentives for low-carbon shipping. Local efforts like the EU ETS and UK Emissions Trading Scheme are exposed to the risk of carbon leakage. Also to shipowners changing their operations in response to local rules. Policy fragmentation can decrease regulatory certainty and deter investment in the shipping sector and among ports and fuel suppliers.

Customer expectations

With mandatory regulation delayed, industry stakeholders shift shipowners toward voluntary climate action. Financiers and customers may increasingly consider emissions transparency and carbon performance when approving loans or awarding contracts as mandatory climate-related disclosures under the ISSB framework take hold. Scrutiny of supply-chain scope 3 emissions is intensifying, placing mounting pressure on customers to reduce emissions across their logistics and procurement networks. This pressure must cascade to their shipping partners where 80% of world trade moves by sea. This incentivises proactive industry players to accelerate their climate strategies, adopt advanced compliance technologies, and pursue green certification as a way to differentiate their offerings and maintain access to customers and finance. In this way, competitive dynamics favour those who move quickly on decarbonisation, even in the absence of direct IMO regulation.

Transition risk and resilience

Without the adoption of the Framework, there is greater onus on customer expectations and voluntary action as key drivers. Shipowners relying solely on baseline compliance expose themselves to heightened reputational and climate transition risks, especially as supply chains and multinational customers demand lower-carbon transport and the global economy is transitioning toward net zero. Anticipating increased market demands and regulation, partnering with like-minded stakeholders, and embedding climate criteria within business models are measures shipowners can take to become more resilient against those risks. Shipping companies that can demonstrate credible action are better positioned to stay afloat amidst policy uncertainty and supply chain disruption, while laggers may encounter escalating pressure from customers, financiers, and civil society. Failing to address emissions proactively is increasingly precipitating climate litigation across the supply chain, underscoring the strategic imperative for shipping companies to decarbonise.

Conclusion

The IMO’s decarbonisation measures - while uncertain whether they will enter into force - represent a watershed moment for the shipping industry. Regardless of whether the Framework will be adopted, IMO's efforts signal a shift towards a more carbon-conscious future with significant implications for contracts, fleet strategy, and investment. The current regulatory uncertainty is challenging, but it does provide a window for industry stakeholders to prepare, adapt, and influence the final shape of the regulatory and market forces around shipping decarbonisation.

Between 1975 and 1985 the CAFE standard doubled fuel efficiency to 27 mpg in cars in the United States.","IMO has kicked the can of sustainability down the road by delaying the Net Zero Framework. It was a strange retreat.

It looked like there would be a useable Framework to reduce emissions, but at the meeting the US fought its implementation tooth and nail and threatened other states if they accepted it. Some countries buckled under and, with the loss of US support, the oil majors saw their chance to jump ship too.

Then ABS expressed doubt about the Framework, and DNV also mumbled about frustrations and then there was a vote to delay implementation of the framework.

It is disturbing that engineers questioned a regulatory technology deadline. Generally, engineers that question a regulatory technology deadline lack the vision to truly apply themselves to the problem or become entangled and confused in politics. Real engineers simply work at fixing the problem, maybe not succeeding in the first pass or the second pass, but hopefully quicker than the next engineer. But trust, whiney engineers are nothing new, I remember encountering half an industry of those as a young engineer in the car industry.

Around 1985 I spent time at Chrysler’s engineering headquarters in Highlands Park. Chrysler had generously offered us the nighttime use of their Cyber 205 supercomputers to perform detailed finite element analyses of America’s Cup 12M structures.

It was fun to be at their engineering headquarters. At that moment the latest Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standard would come into force and Chrysler was the only big three automaker whose engineers had met the standard. Meanwhile, Ford and GM engineering leadership had not paid attention and these companies would incur hundreds of millions in penalties until they could redesign their product line to meet the standard.

A few days later I came into the office and the mood among the Chrysler engineers had completely changed. I asked what happened, and was told that Reagan had given Ford and GM a pass on the CAFE standard because it had been too difficult to implement.

This ignored the fact that Chrysler did meet the standards, and I well remember Lee Iacocco’s outrage at this instance of political corruption. Some may argue that Chrysler had benefitted from a government bail-out in 1980, but that had been paid back with a substantial profit to the government by 1983 for which Iacocco famously stated: ""We at Chrysler borrow money the old-fashioned way. We pay it back"".

As a dyed in the wool capitalist, I strongly support governments that set standards and then lets industries compete to meet those standards. Any industrialist that sabotages that approach is not a capitalist, but rather a freeloader or a cheat.

A similar thing is now happening with the IMO rollback, those who worked hard at meeting the looming standards have now spent money and effort for no useful purpose, and those who hoped and pushed for a roll back are now making mint. The Framework is fair. It benefits the capitalists who are willing to invest and innovate and removes those who remain stuck in the old ways. Moreover, the Framework benefits the public at large and, in this case, all over the world.

Inevitably some anti-capitalists argue that it would kill the industry and result in layoffs and increase shipping rates. That is a liar’s argument.

Yes, it would increase shipping rates for those who do not meet the standard, and in the short term probably will increase shipping rates to pay for the cost of new technologies. However, since maritime shipping rates are such a small fraction of the cost of products, it will hardly be noticeable by the world at large. Historically we have had huge sudden shipping rate increases and cargo still continues to move by sea and the public has no clue whether shipping rates are high or low at any one moment.

Inevitably the technological laggards will have to retire their ships and lay off crews, but the industry will not shrink, and the innovators will hire those crews on their improved ships.

It is a simple fact that Government standard setting and forcing capitalist compliance is extremely effective. Reagan pulled the plug on CAFE but it did not go away. Subsequent efforts did further raise the CAFE ratings and increases in national health, air quality, appliance efficiencies, car and food safety were all achieved through different government dictated performance standards.

Between 1975 and 1985 the CAFE standard doubled fuel efficiency to 27 mpg in cars in the United States. Automakers claimed that the public would not like slow, fuel efficient cars and maybe that is true, but today there are dozens of car models that have better gas mileage than 27 mpg and can outperform any pre-1975 hot rod in its slippers, and that does not even consider EV performance and efficiency.

If we would have continued the CAFE standards after 1985, there is no doubt that within a few years there would have been cars that were both high performance and fuel efficient, if the market demanded that.

Similarly, IMO can achieve massive carbon emission reductions with its Framework and politicians should stay away from it, the public should not worry about it, shipowners should shut up, and engineers should get to work.

Implement the Framework, and may the best capitalists working with the best engineers win!

The U.S. seizure of the tanker Skipper marks a shift from tracking dark fleet activity to direct intervention.

Dark fleet vessels rely on AIS manipulation, false flags, and spoofed positions to evade sanctions enforcement.

Fraudulent registries and stateless vessels have become central to illicit oil transport networks.

Enforcement authorities are increasingly treating false-flag tankers as lawful interdiction targets.

Network-level intelligence is now critical to identifying seizure-grade risk before interdiction occurs.

From Monitoring to Intervention

The dark fleet – tankers engaging in dark activities while moving sanctioned oil, cycling through false flags, and obscuring ownership – has continued to expand, reaching more than 1,900 vessels by the end of Q3. Governments had visibility into this activity. What was less consistent was how that intelligence translated into enforcement outcomes.

That changed with the seizure of Skipper.

When U.S. forces boarded and seized the large crude carrier off the coast of Venezuela, it marked a shift in how sanctions enforcement is being applied. The operation did not rely on a military escalation or a declared conflict. It was grounded in documented sanctions violations, false flagging, and the vessel’s lack of legitimate nationality.

For years, dark fleet vessels operated in the space between detection and consequence. The Skipper seizure shows that this space is narrowing. Vessels that rely on spoofing, false registries, and legal ambiguity are now facing direct intervention, not just continued monitoring.

What the Skipper Seizure Reveals About the Modern Dark Fleet

Skipper was not an outlier. It represented the dominant operating model of today’s dark fleet.

Sanctioned in 2022 for its role in an oil-smuggling network tied to Iran and Hezbollah, the vessel continued operating by exploiting systemic weaknesses. It broadcast AIS data that later proved inconsistent with its true movements.

At the time of the boarding, Skipper’s AIS placed the tanker more than 500 nautical miles away, off the coast of Guyana. Windward’s Remote Sensing Intelligence showed otherwise. Satellite-based detections confirmed the vessel was nowhere near its declared position and had been conducting GNSS manipulation since October 28, broadcasting false coordinates while covertly loading sanctioned crude at Venezuela’s José terminal.

Its position reappeared more than 360 nautical miles from its last spoofed signal. It sailed under the flag of Guyana, a registry that has not existed since 2021, rendering the vessel effectively stateless.

This combination – sanctions exposure, AIS manipulation, and false flagging – is now common. Roughly 400 tankers are currently broadcasting affiliation with fraudulent registries listed by the International Maritime Organization, with nearly 300 already sanctioned. Together, they form part of a broader dark fleet of around 1,000 tankers transporting sanctioned oil for Russia, Iran, and Venezuela.

What distinguishes Skipper is not its behavior, but the response it triggered.

What Has Changed in Enforcement Posture

The seizure of Skipper reflects a more direct application of existing sanctions authorities rather than a new legal framework.

The day after the seizure, the United States sanctioned six shipowners whose VLCCs had been transporting Venezuelan crude. According to the U.S. Treasury, four of those vessels manipulated AIS to conceal port calls and vessel movements. These practices were already well documented. What changed was how that information was acted upon.

In Skipper’s case, the vessel was sanctioned, falsely flagged, and effectively stateless. Those conditions removed many of the protections that dark fleet operators have historically relied on to continue trading despite enforcement pressure. The seizure did not require a military escalation or a new sanctions regime. It relied on existing legal authorities applied decisively.

This signals a narrower but more consequential shift: when sanctions violations, AIS manipulation, and false flagging converge, enforcement may no longer stop at designation alone. Physical intervention has become a viable outcome under specific, documentable conditions.

What Governments Should Expect Next

As enforcement accelerates, pressure will shift upstream.

Interdictions will increasingly rely on early detection rather than last-minute response. Authorities will need to identify which vessels are moving toward seizure-grade risk before they enter contested waters or complete cargo transfers. That requires more than static sanctions lists or AIS tracks viewed in isolation.

Dark fleet operations are networked. Vessels share ownership structures, registries, operational patterns, and deceptive behaviors across regions. AIS manipulation rarely occurs alone. It coincides with false documentation, implausible routing histories, and coordinated loitering patterns that only become visible when viewed as part of a wider system.

Governments that surface these connections early will be positioned to act decisively. Others will remain reactive.",https://windward.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Social-image-Border-security-Intelligence-1-3.png,N,,2025-12-16 09:58:28.196505

The Poseidon Principles comprises of 36 signatories from 14 different countries, representing almost three-quarters of the global ship finance portfolio.","The outlook for cruise shipping is has continued to improve and cruise tourism is growing internationally. Also, the strategic signifigance of the shipping sector as a whole is gaining more importance. The cruise shipping industry is most significant in Finnvera's export credit guarantee exposure. Therefore, monitoring and measuring emissions related to ship finance are also an essential part of Finnvera's climate monitoring. Finnvera calculated the emissions of the ship finance portfolio for the fifth time according to the Poseidon Principles.

The calculation is based on the previous year’s data, thus the CO2 level being reported now has been calculated based on the year 2024.

“In relation to the 2023 IMO GHG Strategy targets, we are closer to the trajectories than last year. The trajectories strongly challenge Finnvera as our ship finance portfolio consists of the world’s largest and most advanced cruise ships and as approximately two thirds of our portfolio covered by the Poseidon Principles are liquified-natural-gas-powered vessels”, says Executive Vice President Jussi Haarasilta.

The impact of the calculation method is most evident in regard to default emission factors of liquified natural gas.

An ambitious target to cut emissions

The original Poseidon Principles iniative is consistent with the policies and ambitions of the International Maritime Organization (IMO), to reduce shipping’s total annual greenhouse gas emissions by at least 50% of 2008 levels by 2050. Aligned with this target Finnvera’s score exceeded the trajectory by 30.7% (2024: 37.4%). In relation to the IMO Revised GHG Strategy target Finnvera’s score exceeded the trajectory by 38.6% (44.1%).

Finnvera finances new, technologically advanced vessels. As the calculation is based on the CO2 emissions in relation to the size of the vessel, the distance travelled, as well as the amount of credit related to the vessel, these factors affect the emissions score and annual volatility

Finnvera has developed its climate targets and reporting

The calculation has improved the quality of the data as a source for assessment, based on which we are also able to specify our reporting on climate impacts. For its operations Finnvera has set a climate target in line with the Paris Climate Agreement’s 1.5. degree target. In November 2024, Finnvera joined the Net-Zero ECA Alliance, a UN initiative, whose goals include creating a measurement method for setting, reporting and monitoring emissions targets and building a common vision for the net-zero goal in export financing.

”In our business activities we emphasize active dialogue with the cruise shipping industry widely from the engine technology developers to shipyards and shipping companies. Ships are ordered far into the future, and technology solutions have to be made at an early stage. The solutions therefore have far-reaching effects. We have good opportunities to influence the development of climate solutions, as we essentially finance new technology aiming to build more environmentally efficient ships. Finnvera is continuing to work on developing climate targets and measures according to the Net-Zero Export Credit Agencies Alliance guidelines.”

This is how the CO2 level is calculated according to Poseidon Principles

Poseidon Principles measures carbon intensity. The data based on which the overall climate alignment score is calculated is distance travelled, amount of fuel consumption for each fuel type, and size of the vessel. The outstanding debt per vessel also play a role when calculating the weighted average of the scores. The calculation is based on a formula that takes into account the distance traveled by the vessels during the year.

The Poseidon Principles members are leading ship financiers, such as international banks, but there are export credit agencies among them. The Poseidon Principles comprises of 36 signatories from 14 different countries, representing almost three-quarters of the global ship finance portfolio. The signatories are leading ship financiers, such as international banks, but there are export credit agencies. Finnvera became signatory in April 2021.

MENA Aims to Boost IMO Liability, Compensation Rules

Maritime stakeholders from Algeria, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Sudan, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia and Yemen completed a regional workshop in Alexandria, Egypt (7-11 December) to strengthen their capacity to enforce the IMO liability and compensation regime.

The IMO liability and compensation regime ensures that victims of maritime incidents receive prompt and adequate compensation, while establishing clear, uniform and limited liability rules for shipowners to ensure a level playing field for safe and clean shipping in the region.

The Maritime Transport and Logistics Sector of Egypt, in cooperation with IMO hosted the workshop, bringing together representatives of maritime administrations and legal experts in the Middle East and North Africa region to enhance their understanding and improve application of key international conventions governing maritime liability and compensation, including:

the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage (1992 CLC);

the International Convention on the Establishment of an International Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage (1992 Fund Convention);

the Protocol on Liability and Compensation for Damage in Connection with the Carriage of Hazardous and Noxious Substances by Sea (2010 HNS Convention);

the International Convention on Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage (2001 Bunkers Convention);

the Nairobi International Convention on the Removal of Wrecks (2007 Nairobi WRC); and

the International Convention on Salvage (1989 Salvage Convention).

Opening the workshop, Head of Maritime Transport and Logistics Sector of Egypt Rear Admiral Hussein Mustafa El Geziry, encouraged all participating Member States to accede to and fully implement all IMO treaties related to the liability and compensation regime. This would help ensure that costs arising from maritime incidents are properly covered and also enhance sustainable shipping, noting recent incidents where ships lacked the relevant insurance coverage.

Presentations were delivered by a team from the IMO Legal and External Relations Division, the IOPC Funds Secretariat, and the P & I Clubs, alongside contributions from national representatives highlighting their domestic law-making and implementation processes. These exchanges highlighted national experiences and challenges in aligning with the relevant IMO treaties.

The workshop is expected to contribute to the ratification, implementation and enforcement of the IMO's liability and compensation instruments across all participating Member States.

The corridor will operate 12-15 voyages per year, each lasting around 40 days.

Odfjell has established an offtake of B24 sustainable biofuel in Rio Grande to secure long-term fuel availability. The Ports of Antwerp, Rotterdam and Rio Grande are working together with Odfjell to advance the green corridor through increased efficiency and optimized port-stay processes.

A practical path to zero-emission shipping—starting now

“We do this to demonstrate that certified fuel, technology, and infrastructure are already available,” says CEO Harald Fotland. “Through this, we show that sustainable biofuel is a viable option for deep-sea shipping today.”

Fotland emphasizes that this is not a one-off demonstration but a long-term commitment.

“With this corridor, we integrate greener fuel as a new pillar in our decarbonization strategy. We activate the entire value chain to find ways to decarbonize our operations, and we are encouraged that key stakeholders are joining us in this groundbreaking initiative.”

Industry-led action for scalable infrastructure

Norway-headquartered Odfjell has taken independent action—self-funding the project and moving ahead without subsidies.

“By covering the additional cost ourselves, we eliminate the financial element and move directly into operational implementation. It may not be a perfect corridor yet, but a solid start. Its success depends on collaboration across the value chain, and we are committed to developing it further together with relevant stakeholders,” Fotland says.

This includes collaboration with ports to increase efficiency, with customers to maximize capacity utilization, and with fuel providers to increase the influx of green fuels.

In Brazil, the currently available sustainable biofuel quality is the so-called certified B24 – a blend of 24% renewable biodiesel derived from waste and 76% VLSFO.

Introducing biofuel marks another step in Odfjell’s decade-long work to reduce emissions. The company has already improved its carbon intensity by more than 54% compared to the 2008 benchmark, achieved through a wide range of technical and operational measures.

The initiative aligns with IMO’s 2030 targets and the EU’s Fit for 55 ambitions, and builds on the 2024 Norway-Brazil MoU to establish a green, transatlantic shipping corridor.

“We hope to inspire broader industry action and welcome continued collaboration with regulators, ports, producers, other ship operators, and customers to accelerate the transition to low-emission maritime transport,” Fotland ends.",https://www.ajot.com/images/uploads/article/_large/bow-leopard-odfjell-tankers_copy.png,N,,2025-12-16 03:56:30.862400

U.S. Gulf Coast Methanol Bunkering Push Could Be A Game Changer For Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha (TSE:9101)

Simply Wall St

Reviewed by Sasha Jovanovic

December 15, 2025

In December 2025, American Bureau of Shipping, ENEOS, Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha and SEACOR Holdings began a joint study to develop a low‑carbon methanol bunkering and supply chain network along the U.S. Gulf Coast, targeting the first commercial-scale ship-to-ship methanol bunkering operations in the country.

The collaboration positions NYK Line to apply its LNG bunkering experience to emerging methanol fuel infrastructure, aligning its shipping operations with the International Maritime Organization’s 2050 net-zero greenhouse gas emissions goal.

We’ll now examine how NYK Line’s move into U.S. Gulf Coast methanol bunkering could influence its investment narrative and future positioning.

Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha Investment Narrative Recap

To own NYK Line, you generally need to believe it can convert its scale in global shipping into sustainable earnings while managing cyclical freight markets and capital intensive decarbonization. The methanol bunkering study on the U.S. Gulf Coast supports NYK’s energy transition credentials, but the immediate focus for many shareholders is likely still on how the company manages its recently lowered earnings and dividend guidance, which remain the more material short term catalyst and risk.

In that context, the November 2025 update cutting the end year ordinary dividend forecast to JPY 85.00 per share, alongside reduced profit guidance for the year ending March 31, 2026, is highly relevant. It highlights management’s willingness to reset payouts when earnings soften, even after committing to a higher long term dividend policy, and frames decarbonization moves like methanol bunkering as part of a broader question about how reliably future cash flows will support shareholder returns.

Yet behind NYK Line’s energy transition initiatives, investors also need to be aware of how dividend cuts could signal...

Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha's narrative projects ¥2409.5 billion revenue and ¥218.4 billion earnings by 2028. This requires revenue to decline by 1.7% per year and an earnings decrease of ¥201.2 billion from ¥419.6 billion today.

, a 5% upside to its current price.

Exploring Other Perspectives

Two fair value estimates from the Simply Wall St Community span a wide band from ¥2,583.85 to ¥5,248.18, underscoring sharply different views on NYK Line. When you set those against the recent earnings and dividend downgrades, it reinforces how important it is to weigh several perspectives on the company’s ability to sustain profits through the energy transition.

“But even more importantly, we’re seeing recognition from these countries that green corridors are more than just environmental projects – they are strategic economic infrastructure.","The EU-funded feasibility study will focus on transatlantic traffic between Panama – a global hub for shipping – and Algeciras in Spain, located by the Strait of Gibraltar and one of Europe’s busiest container ports. Both locations are also key bunkering ports, making them strong candidates to play a role in shipping’s decarbonisation journey.

According to Ricardo, the study will investigate the technical, financial and policy conditions required to enable zero or low emissions trade across the route. This includes feasible fuel options, the cost of alternative fuel vessels versus existing ships, as well as compliance costs associated with regulations such as the IMO Net-Zero Framework, FuelEU Maritime, and the EU ETS. The project will also examine how policy can help bridge some of the cost gaps and accelerate deployment of green shipping technology.

Ricardo will lead the study in partnership with the Algeciras Bay Port Authority, the Panama Canal Authority, the Panama Maritime Authority, and Maritime & Logistics Consulting Group.

“The Panama–Algeciras green shipping corridor is not only significant because of its trans-oceanic distance, but also because it connects two major global bunker hubs with strong potential to become green hubs,” said Alexi Pons, Ricardo’s associate director for Transport Policy.

“Developing green shipping infrastructure along this route could deliver transformative benefits for both regions. We’re very excited to be working with the Algeciras Bay Port Authority, the Panama Canal Authority, the Panama Maritime Authority and the EU on this project.”

According to the Global Maritime Forum, over 80 green shipping corridors have now been established worldwide, with China, India, and Brazil leading the way. However, its annual report also noted that just four of these corridors have reached the ‘realisation’ stage, where construction or operation of vessels or infrastructure has taken place.

The report states that many of these projects have been stalled by a 'feasibility wall' created by the cost gap between conventional and zero-emission fuels. The IMO Net Zero Framework has been designed to help address these issues, but recent talks to adopt it collapsed under threats from the US, which claims the regulations will cause it economic harm. But according to Jesse Fahnestock, director of decarbonisation at the Global Maritime Forum, green shipping represents a significant economic opportunity.

“The move of major countries like China, India, and Brazil into green corridors is hugely promising, as these are markets that will determine whether zero-emission shipping scales fast enough to meet global climate goals,” said Fahnestock.

“But even more importantly, we’re seeing recognition from these countries that green corridors are more than just environmental projects – they are strategic economic infrastructure. Countries that move early stand to gain competitive industrial and geopolitical advantages across energy, trade, and technology.”",https://www.theengineer.co.uk/media/oinihw1u/green.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 07:56:15.663230

Driven by rising global Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) standards and India’s obligations under Renewable Purchase Obligations (RPOs), the shift marks a decisive move towards safer, cleaner and more resilient port operations.

With a vast coastline rich in mangroves, coral reefs, lagoons and marine biodiversity, Indian ports are under increasing pressure from trade expansion and infrastructure development. To address these challenges responsibly, the country has aligned its maritime policies with the International Maritime Organization’s framework and nine UN Sustainable Development Goals, focusing on renewable power adoption, improved air and water quality, enhanced waste management and expansion of green cover.

The Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways (MoPSW) has outlined this transition through the Maritime India Vision (MIV) 2030, a comprehensive blueprint to modernise the sector while embedding sustainability at its core. The strategy identifies clean fuels such as green hydrogen, ammonia, biofuels and LNG as critical to the future of maritime transport, supported by India’s National Green Hydrogen Mission.

Launched to reduce carbon emissions and position India as a global green hydrogen hub, the mission targets annual production of 5 million tonnes of green hydrogen by 2030. It is expected to attract investments of ₹8 lakh crore, generate six lakh jobs and cut fossil fuel imports by ₹1 lakh crore. As part of this initiative, Kandla, Paradip and V.O. Chidambaranar (Tuticorin) ports have been identified for development as green hydrogen hubs.

The green maritime push is further reinforced by long-term policy roadmaps. Under Maritime India Vision 2030, investments of ₹3–3.5 lakh crore are projected across ports, shipping and inland waterways, supported by a recent ₹69,725 crore package to revitalise shipbuilding. Complementing this is the Maritime Amrit Kaal Vision 2047, which earmarks nearly ₹80 lakh crore for ports, green shipping, coastal shipping, inland waterways and shipbuilding, with over 300 actionable initiatives aimed at making India a leading maritime nation by its centenary year of independence.

To operationalise sustainability goals, the government has rolled out several green port initiatives. Ports are being encouraged to develop captive solar power through rooftop installations, unused land and floating solar projects on calm waters. Wind energy adoption is being expanded through onshore and offshore projects, including exploration of offshore wind potential near Okha and the southern peninsula, alongside tidal, wave and solar thermal energy pilots.

Flagship programmes such as the Harit Sagar Green Port Guidelines, National Green Hydrogen Mission and the Green Tug Transition Programme (GTTP) are reshaping port operations. The ₹25,000 crore Maritime Development Fund aims to catalyse investments in green infrastructure, alternative fuels and fleet modernisation. Under the GTTP, conventional harbour tugs will be replaced with greener alternatives, supported by 30 per cent government funding and aligned with the ‘Make in India’ initiative.

The ‘Panch Karma Sankalp’, announced in May 2024, outlines five major actions, including procurement of green tugs by major ports, development of green hydrogen hubs, creation of a single-window portal for cruise facilitation, and transformation of select ports into smart ports. Complementary initiatives such as the Harit Nauka (Green Vessel) guidelines for inland waterways and the Coastal Green Shipping Corridor—starting with the Kandla–Tuticorin route—are further strengthening low-emission maritime transport.

Ports are also focusing on emission reduction through cleaner fuels, shore-to-ship power, electrification of material-handling equipment and LNG bunkering. The government has set a target for 50 per cent of port vehicles to switch to cleaner fuels by 2030. Green belts are being expanded to control air and noise pollution, enhance biodiversity and improve coastal resilience, in line with the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change’s mandate for 33 per cent green coverage.

A major legislative push comes with the Indian Ports Bill, 2025, which replaces the century-old framework with a modern law mandating global green norms and disaster readiness. The reform follows a decade of strong sector growth, with cargo handling at major ports reaching a record 855 million tonnes in FY 2024–25, port capacity rising nearly 87 per cent, and ship turnaround times halving to 48 hours. Indian ports have also gained international recognition, with nine featuring in the World Bank’s Container Port Performance Index.

On the global stage, India is strengthening partnerships and dialogues to advance sustainable maritime growth. Platforms such as Sagarmanthan and the Green & Digital Maritime Corridors Dialogue at Jawaharlal Nehru Port Authority have brought together global stakeholders to shape the future of green shipping. Bilateral initiatives, including the India–Singapore Green and Digital Shipping Corridor, aim to accelerate low-emission technologies and digital transformation.

India is also enhancing marine pollution control through robust oil-spill response planning, satellite-based monitoring, oil-sensitivity mapping and prioritisation of ecologically sensitive coastal areas.

As India charts its course towards 2047, the maritime sector is emerging as a cornerstone of sustainable development. Through integrated policy reforms, green technologies and global cooperation, the country is positioning itself not only as a growing maritime power but also as a responsible steward of the oceans and a leader in sustainable shipping.",https://solarquarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/26-2.png,N,,2025-12-15 06:56:15.482880

The disruptor-in-chief was the biggest factor shaping global affairs in 2025 and the top spot on our annual ranking of influence was never really in doubt.

His tariffs bludgeoned the multilateral trade system, his derailment of shipping’s net zero strategy has called into question the very future of global regulation for a global industry via the International Maritime Organization. Very few decisions in shipping this year were unaffected by the Trump factor.

No doubt that will be the case for as long as he remains in the White House, but don’t expect 2026 to simply be a rerun of what has just played out over the past 12 months.

Despite everything, most shipping markets did just fine in 2025.

But the disruptive forces that have allowed shipping markets to defy economic gravity thus far are not going to last forever.

Yes, friction is good for shipping, but over time it becomes a cost. While it was the big geopolitical factors shaping our world thus far, there are more homemade problems heading in our direction for next year.

Longer distances have powered shipping markets since 2020, but the forces fuelling those longer distances are changing.

A delivery bulge is nearing, and utilisation is set to slip as the fleet grows 5% against a 1.5% uptick in tonne-mile demand.

Fleet growth is set to outpace distance adjusted demand next year, and we are not going to be able to scrap our way out of this imbalance immediately, or at least not enough to offset the delivery wave.

The outlook for rates is turning tougher.

So yes, shipping thrives on unpredictability, crisis and luck.

But that doesn’t address the big issues shaping the industry’s future. It doesn’t insulate everyone from a downturn that has the potential to be brutal, regardless of how cash-rich owners feel they are right now.

Everything from technology to globalisation itself is changing around the traditional business model and if this year has taught us anything, it is that we should probably expect the unexpected.",https://www.lloydslist.com/-/media/lloyds-list/images/daily-view/ll-dv-monday.png?rev=c969b87b902549448d61fa9e9247af2b,N,,2025-12-15 06:56:20.997767

Signatories, which represent almost three-quarters of the global shipping finance portfolio, disclosed 95% of their eligible portfolio activity in 2025, up from 93% in 2024.

Poseidon Principles will expand to include more financial institutions—from private equity and hedge funds to capital markets underwriters—with an aim to further increase climate transparency in shipping finance.

15 December 2025, Copenhagen – Ship financiers’ lending portfolios are getting closer to reaching climate alignment with the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) ambitious decarbonisation trajectories, with average scores against the ‘minimum trajectory’ improving by nearly 8 percentage points.

The news was revealed today in the Sixth Annual Disclosure Report of the Poseidon Principles, the world’s first sector-specific framework for financial institutions to assess and disclose the climate alignment of their shipping portfolios. With 36 signatories across 14 countries, representing nearly three-quarters of the world’s ship finance portfolio, the initiative establishes a benchmark for the industry in line with the IMO’s goal of net zero greenhouse gas emissions from international shipping by 2050.

This year, signatories disclosed 95% of their eligible portfolio activity, up from 93% last year and the second-highest level since reporting began.

Paul Taylor, Vice Chair of the Poseidon Principles and Global Head of Maritime Industries, Societe Generale, said: “Transparency is key. It fosters collaboration between financial institutions and shipowners, and guides capital toward more efficient vessels and cleaner fuels. The results of this year’s report show encouraging, measurable, real-world momentum and progress in action. Signatories are disclosing the vast majority of their portfolios, showing increasing collaboration between financiers and clients, and climate alignment scores have moved closer to the IMO’s decarbonisation pathways. This progress is particularly striking considering the pathways become more stringent year-on-year. In short, the Poseidon Principles continue to demonstrate the power of financial transparency in guiding the shipping industry’s transition.”

The report shows that emissions data is increasingly informing credit decisions and innovative financial products, such as sustainability-linked loans. Operational efficiency, retrofits, and emerging fuel pathways are noted as key drivers of score improvements this year, and the scores were also impacted by evolving methodologies and external factors, including rerouting vessels on longer routes and disruptions in supply chains. The framework positions financial institutions as active partners in the industry’s transition.

2025 Annual Disclosure Report key findings

Increasing transparency: Twenty-nine signatories disclosed 90% or more of their in-scope portfolio, while nine signatories achieved 100% reporting, the highest number of signatories to hit these two respective targets to date. The average disclosure rate across all signatories was 95%.

Improved climate alignment: While the average scores remain misaligned with the IMO’s net-zero pathways, substantial year-on-year improvements were recorded. Against the IMO’s ‘minimum trajectory’, the scores went from just over 19% misaligned last year to just under 12% misaligned this year, representing a nearly 8 percentage point improvement. Against the IMO’s ‘striving trajectory’, scores went from 25% misaligned to just over 18% misaligned.

Meaningful progress in the cargo and passenger segments: The cargo and passenger segments saw improvements from 14% to 6% misaligned, and from 38% to 26% misaligned, respectively. These shifts demonstrate advances in vessel efficiency, increased uptake of low-emission fuels, and the entry of more efficient dual-fuel vessels into the fleet.

It is important to note that the decarbonisation trajectories set by the 2023 IMO’s GHG Strategy get more challenging to reach each year, making it more difficult to achieve alignment as time goes on. Seeing improvements year-on-year is promising, but additional efforts are still needed to reach milestones in 2030, 2040, and 2050.

Reinforcing the initiative as an established, globally recognised standard for shipping finance, the Poseidon Principles methodology has been included as an acceptable method to set near-term and long-term portfolio alignment targets as part of the Science Based Targets initiative’s Financial Institutions Net-Zero Standard.

Associate membership expansion

Since 2019, the Poseidon Principles have matured into a globally recognised benchmark for transparent, industry-wide climate reporting that has been replicated by other critical sectors, such as steel, aluminium, and aviation. Now, there is a willingness to go further in bringing other institutions on board.

In addition to the lenders, lessors, and financial guarantors historically represented in the signatory list, the Poseidon Principles are now expanding to offer associate membership to a broader range of financial institutions, including private equity, hedge funds, and capital markets underwriters. This expansion will increase the initiative’s potential impact by engaging the wider financial community in the framework without initial reporting obligations. This expansion will strengthen the Association’s influence across the full maritime finance ecosystem and support a broader, more consistent approach to emissions accountability.

Michael Parker, Poseidon Principles Chair and Chairman of Global Shipping & Logistics, Citi, said: “The Poseidon Principles Annual Disclosure Report has become a vital pulse check for the industry, showing how global lending portfolios measure up against the climate ambitions set by the IMO. This consistent transparency gives us a clear view of progress across approximately three-quarters of global ship finance. Without it, we would have no meaningful way to understand how far we and the industry have come, or how far we still need to go. ""Today, the Poseidon Principles are taking another important step to deepen that transparency. By opening Associate Membership to any institution providing or arranging capital for the maritime sector—including private equity firms and hedge funds—we are broadening the lens through which climate considerations can be directly integrated into financing decisions. This expansion supports a broader commitment to transparency and accountability across finance and reinforces the sector’s contribution to a more sustainable future for shipping.”

The latest report cements the critical nature of finance in supporting the shipping industry’s shift toward a zero-emission future while emphasising the crucial role transparency plays in measuring climate alignment.

Poseidon Principles will expand to include more financial institutions—from private equity and hedge funds to capital markets underwriters—with an aim to further increase climate transparency in shipping finance.

15 December 2025, Copenhagen – Ship financiers’ lending portfolios are getting closer to reaching climate alignment with the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) ambitious decarbonisation trajectories, with average scores against the ‘minimum trajectory’ improving by nearly 8 percentage points.

The news was revealed today in the Sixth Annual Disclosure Report of the Poseidon Principles, the world’s first sector-specific framework for financial institutions to assess and disclose the climate alignment of their shipping portfolios. With 36 signatories across 14 countries, representing nearly three-quarters of the world’s ship finance portfolio, the initiative establishes a benchmark for the industry in line with the IMO’s goal of net zero greenhouse gas emissions from international shipping by 2050.

This year, signatories disclosed 95% of their eligible portfolio activity, up from 93% last year and the second-highest level since reporting began.

Paul Taylor, Vice Chair of the Poseidon Principles and Global Head of Maritime Industries, Societe Generale, said: “Transparency is key. It fosters collaboration between financial institutions and shipowners, and guides capital toward more efficient vessels and cleaner fuels. The results of this year’s report show encouraging, measurable, real-world momentum and progress in action. Signatories are disclosing the vast majority of their portfolios, showing increasing collaboration between financiers and clients, and climate alignment scores have moved closer to the IMO’s decarbonisation pathways. This progress is particularly striking considering the pathways become more stringent year-on-year. In short, the Poseidon Principles continue to demonstrate the power of financial transparency in guiding the shipping industry’s transition.”

The report shows that emissions data is increasingly informing credit decisions and innovative financial products, such as sustainability-linked loans. Operational efficiency, retrofits, and emerging fuel pathways are noted as key drivers of score improvements this year, and the scores were also impacted by evolving methodologies and external factors, including rerouting vessels on longer routes and disruptions in supply chains. The framework positions financial institutions as active partners in the industry’s transition.

2025 Annual Disclosure Report key findings

Increasing transparency: Twenty-nine signatories disclosed 90% or more of their in-scope portfolio, while nine signatories achieved 100% reporting, the highest number of signatories to hit these two respective targets to date. The average disclosure rate across all signatories was 95%.

Improved climate alignment: While the average scores remain misaligned with the IMO’s net-zero pathways, substantial year-on-year improvements were recorded. Against the IMO’s ‘minimum trajectory’, the scores went from just over 19% misaligned last year to just under 12% misaligned this year, representing a nearly 8 percentage point improvement. Against the IMO’s ‘striving trajectory’, scores went from 25% misaligned to just over 18% misaligned.

Meaningful progress in the cargo and passenger segments: The cargo and passenger segments saw improvements from 14% to 6% misaligned, and from 38% to 26% misaligned, respectively. These shifts demonstrate advances in vessel efficiency, increased uptake of low-emission fuels, and the entry of more efficient dual-fuel vessels into the fleet.

It is important to note that the decarbonisation trajectories set by the 2023 IMO’s GHG Strategy get more challenging to reach each year, making it more difficult to achieve alignment as time goes on. Seeing improvements year-on-year is promising, but additional efforts are still needed to reach milestones in 2030, 2040, and 2050.

Reinforcing the initiative as an established, globally recognised standard for shipping finance, the Poseidon Principles methodology has been included as an acceptable method to set near-term and long-term portfolio alignment targets as part of the Science Based Targets initiative’s Financial Institutions Net-Zero Standard.

Associate membership expansion

Since 2019, the Poseidon Principles have matured into a globally recognised benchmark for transparent, industry-wide climate reporting that has been replicated by other critical sectors, such as steel, aluminium, and aviation. Now, there is a willingness to go further in bringing other institutions on board.

In addition to the lenders, lessors, and financial guarantors historically represented in the signatory list, the Poseidon Principles are now expanding to offer associate membership to a broader range of financial institutions, including private equity, hedge funds, and capital markets underwriters. This expansion will increase the initiative’s potential impact by engaging the wider financial community in the framework without initial reporting obligations. This expansion will strengthen the Association’s influence across the full maritime finance ecosystem and support a broader, more consistent approach to emissions accountability.

Michael Parker, Poseidon Principles Chair and Chairman of Global Shipping & Logistics, Citi, said: “The Poseidon Principles Annual Disclosure Report has become a vital pulse check for the industry, showing how global lending portfolios measure up against the climate ambitions set by the IMO. This consistent transparency gives us a clear view of progress across approximately three-quarters of global ship finance. Without it, we would have no meaningful way to understand how far we and the industry have come, or how far we still need to go. ""Today, the Poseidon Principles are taking another important step to deepen that transparency. By opening Associate Membership to any institution providing or arranging capital for the maritime sector—including private equity firms and hedge funds—we are broadening the lens through which climate considerations can be directly integrated into financing decisions. This expansion supports a broader commitment to transparency and accountability across finance and reinforces the sector’s contribution to a more sustainable future for shipping.”

The latest report cements the critical nature of finance in supporting the shipping industry’s shift toward a zero-emission future while emphasising the crucial role transparency plays in measuring climate alignment.

The V.O. Chidambaranar (VoC) Port is set to roll out a Green Hydrogen Pilot Project aimed at establishing a bunkering facility for green hydrogen and its derivatives. The initiative seeks to support the gradual adoption of green fuels in the shipping sector by providing refuelling infrastructure for vessels operating on both domestic and international routes.

According to a written reply in the Lok Sabha by the Union Minister of Ports, Shipping and Waterways, Shri Sarbananda Sonowal, the project is expected to significantly reduce CO₂ emissions while generating direct and indirect employment opportunities in the manufacturing, storage, and ancillary services associated with green fuels.

This pilot marks a strategic step toward decarbonizing India’s maritime transport and promoting sustainable fuel alternatives in the country’s shipping industry.

The Nigerian Port Economic Regulation of 2015 has remained our guiding document and the framework through which we currently execute our mandate.
At the Nigerian Shippers’ Council, we have carefully studied these infrastructural gaps and what is needed to address them.
Under the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), it is evident that one of the biggest challenges will be maritime logistics.","In this interview, Executive Secretary/Chief Executive Officer of the Nigerian Shippers’ Council (NSC), Dr Pius Akutah, reflects on the Council’s most significant milestones, outlines expectations for the next phase under the current administration, and highlights how ongoing reforms from port regulation to inland logistics and dispute resolution are laying the foundation for a more efficient and globally competitive maritime economy. PAUL OGBUOKIRI reports.

Looking back at your two years as Executive Secretary, what would you identify as the most significant achievement of the Council on your watch?

Two years have indeed come and gone, and within that period, a great deal has happened in the Council. As you requested, I will highlight the most significant achievement we have recorded, and it is the passing of the Nigerian Port Economic Regulatory Agency Bill. At the moment, it is undergoing final refinements by the National Assembly after being vetted by the Office of the AttorneyGeneral of the Federation.

Once this stage is completed, it will proceed to the President for assent. This development is particularly important because the Council has long operated under a 1978 Decree, now codified as CAP N133 LFN 2004. The Nigerian Shippers’ Council Act is an outdated law that no longer reflects the realities or reform direction of the maritime sector under the administration of President Bola Ahmed Tinubu.

For us as a Council, this new legal framework is crucial. It equips us to address sectoral challenges more effectively and positions the industry to attain the targets set by Mr. President for a modern, efficient, and globally competitive maritime sector.

Can you give us an idea of what you expect in the second half of your tenure which you have stepped into now?

First of all, I must congratulate Mr. President for the leadership he is providing in driving the economic rebirth of this country. For many years, we have spoken about diversifying Nigeria’s economy, but for the first time, we are now witnessing true diversification in both real time and in practical terms.

The Maritime and Blue Economy sector holds immense potential. As we unlock these opportunities, we will generate significant wealth, create jobs, and lift many Nigerians out of poverty. The reality and importance of this sector are now clearly visible to everyone. Fortunately, we have a proactive Minister who is working tirelessly to reposition Nigeria on the global stage as a true maritime nation.

The passage of the Marine and Blue Economy Policy championed by His Excellency Adegboyega Oyetola, shows that the necessary foundations for the sector have been firmly laid. As we move into the second half of this administration’s tenure, the next two years carry great significance for the Ministry of Marine and Blue Economy. A lot has already been done to prepare the ground for what is coming next.

I believe that with the structures now in place, we will witness major progress in the next phase. For us as a Council in particular, we are focused on securing assent to our bill. By virtue of a government gazette, NSC to a large extent started performing its role as an economic regulator.

Now, could you give us an overview of your interaction with stakeholders in the sector and how they are cooperating with you in respect of this mandate that you have already undertaken so far? The Nigerian Port Economic Regulation of 2015 has remained our guiding document and the framework through which we currently execute our mandate.

I must acknowledge that stakeholders have demonstrated a genuine willingness to work collaboratively with us. Everyone recognizes that the sector is facing challenges, and no one is interested in sustaining these problems. Instead, stakeholders are focused on protecting their investments and ensuring profitability. So far, engagements with stakeholders have been smooth.

We have not encountered any major issues, and shippers’ associations across the country have fully cooperated with us. I am pleased to note that we have introduced certain policies, and stakeholders have promptly adjusted to them. This level of responsiveness has contributed to a healthy working relationship as we move forward. We all understand that the more reformed and efficient the sector becomes, the better it is for every player operating within it.

Today, the shipping sector has become one of the most attractive areas of employment, offering a minimum wage of over ₦200,000 a standard negotiated by the Council. While this wage structure has existed for over two decades, it is important to emphasize that achieving and sustaining this milestone would have been impossible without the active support and contributions of stakeholders.

To what extent are the various government agencies in the sector, especially those not in the same ministry with you, are keying into your reforms, and to what extent have you also modernized your operations to be in tandem with global best practices, talking about national single window and port community system?

Most of these interventions and reforms are still ongoing. Within the Ministry of Marine and Blue Economy, the traditional agencies that everyone is familiar with have now been fully integrated into the ministry’s policy framework.

As a result, challenges related to collaboration and coordination have significantly reduced, as the ministry now maintains firm oversight and alignment across its agencies. Today, the ministry hosts a wider range of agencies than before, including those moved from other ministries.

However, the maritime ecosystem still intersects with numerous ministries. For example, as a Council, we promote an intermodal transport system, which cannot be achieved without engaging the Ministry of Transportation. Over the years, the Council has signed various Memoranda of Understanding (MoU) with agencies located in other ministries.

One such MoU exists with the Nigerian Railway Corporation, designed to ensure a harmonious working relationship and to promote key services within the sector. Specifically, this MoU guides cooperation between the Nigerian Shippers’ Council and the Nigerian Railway Corporation on cost structuring and ensures that shippers are not shortchanged when using the rail system recognizing that rail remains the most efficient and cost effective means of cargo movement across the country.

Similar agreements exist with other agencies across different ministries. The Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) is also a major stakeholder in the country’s maritime structure, and we maintain an excellent and robust working relationship with them. As a Council, our guiding principle has always been to advocate for cooperation with every stakeholder, because collectively we are executing the mandate of Mr. President, as provided under Section 5 of the 1999 Constitution.

Can we have a measurable projection in respect to the Nigerian Port Economic Regulatory Bill? What are the immediate, medium, and long-term gains that we expect from that bill if signed into law?

In the medium term, we will see a surge in investment as investor confidence increases. Predictability both in regulation and in return on investment is a key factor for investors, especially in a sector as capitalintensive as the port and shipping industry. Investments here require significant financial commitments, and investors must be certain that the regulatory environment will remain stable.

They need assurance that policies and laws will not suddenly shift in ways that could negatively affect their investments. Without this clarity and predictability, no serious investor will commit substantial funds to such a sensitive and high-cost sector. In the long term, Nigeria will begin to fully integrate into the global maritime community.

Our processes would have been streamlined and key systems such as the cargo tracking note, the port community system, and the National Single Window will be fully operational. Together with a solid regulatory framework, these systems will create a modern and efficient maritime environment. At that point, Nigeria will truly stand out as a maritime nation of repute, recognized globally for its efficiency, competitiveness, and regulatory strength.

Can you give us an insight into the Truck Transit Park that has been promoted by the Nigerian Shippers Council, a brief into what the geographical spread is, project completion, and their contribution to the good and growth of the Nigerian economy, particularly the logistics sector?

Nigeria is a country located in West Africa, and across the continent from North Africa to West, Central, and Southern Africa you find port infrastructures spread widely. As the most populous nation on the continent, Nigeria remains a country the rest of Africa looks up to, even though they are not waiting for us. Several African nations are already making deliberate efforts to develop their maritime infrastructure, especially in the area of logistics.

Nigeria is not entirely behind, but we are behind to an extent, particularly because Africa expects us to take the lead in developing logistics infrastructure. At the Nigerian Shippers’ Council, we have carefully studied these infrastructural gaps and what is needed to address them.

Today, we have developed two important maps, one covering the entire African continent. It highlights the distribution of critical maritime infrastructure, especially those linked to logistics. Under the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), it is evident that one of the biggest challenges will be maritime logistics. Connecting African countries remains extremely difficult.

For example, a vessel carrying cargo from Nigeria to Ghana may first go to Europe before returning to Ghana. This is inefficient and time consuming, underscoring the urgent need for proper African connectivity. A key challenge is that most African countries are not ship owning nations.

They lease vessels, and these vessels operate on predetermined routes that cannot easily be altered to create direct African shipping lanes. That is the crux of the problem. Bringing it back home, we examined logistics supporting infrastructure and concluded that, as a Council, we must promote the development of Inland Dry Ports, Transit Parks, Border Facilities, and similar structures.

These will support the movement of Transit Cargo from the hinterlands to the seaports and bring shipping services closer to shippers across the country. Regarding inland dry ports, we have several legacy projects. When Mr. President assumed office, he pushed for the completion of the nearly finished Funtua Inland Dry Port.

Currently, the operational dry ports are mainly in the north-western region, Kano, Kaduna, and Katsina. Others exist across the country, but their progress has been slow. We are working with state governments to accelerate their completion.

In Borno State, for instance, a privately developed inland dry port has been established. We are now engaging stakeholders to fast-track its completion so that it can be commissioned during the second half of the President’s tenure.

The Governor of Borno State is particularly committed to achieving this. For Vehicle Transit Parks, one of the major issues you raised, we observed that many road accidents are caused by driver fatigue. Drivers travel long hours without rest, leading to fatal accidents.

To address this, we began promoting the establishment of Vehicle Transit Parks. These parks are not only rest stops; they will also serve as economic hubs where drivers can relax, refresh, and secure their cargo. Rather than parking in unsafe roadside areas where goods can be stolen or damaged, drivers will have safe, secure, and well equipped facilities.",https://newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-14-090000.png,N,,2025-12-14 23:56:20.544710

These risks include potential tariff-related escalation; other protectionism-driven tensions such as port fees; the possible resumption of Red Sea transits; a potential conflict in Venezuela; and increasing competition for control of shipping value chains.

We expect container-shipping performance to weaken in 2026, according to Global Shipping Outlook 2026, as lower freight rates resulting from a weakened supply-demand balance will lead to lower profits, alongside the risk to freight rates from a potential resumption of Red Sea transits. We expect regional variations, with container trade to North America remaining particularly weak compared with other regions.

The container order book, at about 30% of the existing fleet, is at its highest level in more than 10 years. This reflects continuing new orders to replace ageing fleets and to upgrade vessels to multi‑fuel capability to meet emissions‑reduction targets, as well as capacity growth. As a result, we expect supply to exceed demand; however, we also expect partial mitigation through increased fleet idling (from about 1% currently), blank sailings, scrapping and slow steaming.

Tankers should continue to perform well, particularly crude tankers, due to growth in end demand and tonne-miles. Seaborne oil trade grew in 2025 due to higher production by OPEC+ and non-OPEC+ producers, leading to about a 3% supply increase, with the same expected in 2026. The rise in tonne-miles related to oil exports from Russia, and Red Sea disruption has kept overall demand for tankers high.

We expect weak performance in the dry-bulk segment but volumes should be stable year on year. Order books remain healthy, at close to 11% and 16% of the existing fleet for dry bulk and tankers, respectively, which are needed to replace the ageing fleets. Further significant growth is limited by the shortage of yard slots for new orders over the next three years.

We expect performance across other segments, such as liquefied natural gas shipping and car carriers, to remain broadly stable.

A further increase in trade protectionism could also alter trade flows and limit demand for certain high-margin or critical products in the medium term. Some new trade lanes could strengthen to offset those more affected by tariffs, but we believe protectionism is overall negative for the shipping industry.

Emissions regulations have developed further and there is better visibility over the International Maritime Organisation’s longer-term plan through the Net-Zero framework, although it is yet to be approved. These regulatory developments are likely to put pressure on shipping companies’ margins in the medium term, and the extent of pass-through is not yet known.",https://www.ajot.com/images/uploads/article/_large/Global_Shipping_and_Demand.png,N,,2025-12-12 23:31:04.567637

What do we need from the next ten years to complete the job?

Not enough, but far better

That global emissions are still edging up hides half the story. Emissions are growing far more slowly than in the decade before Paris and China’s emissions have been flat or declining since 2024. Clean energy investment is at record levels and now outpaces fossil fuel investment by roughly two to one after reaching parity six years ago. Electrotech is driving growth in major economies and with renewable energy the cheapest and fastest energy source to deploy, non‑fossil sources already provide over 41% of the global energy mix. In 2015, we all predicted this scale of change would take until the mid‑2030s.

The world economy is shifting, and the political and legal clarity that the Paris Agreement consensus provided is at the root of this transformation. The latest round of national climate plans, the crux of the Paris Agreement architecture, still adds up to a pathway of 2.3-2.5 degrees of warming, but they do represent plans that will see emissions drop by at least 12% on 2019 levels by 2035. Countries just agreed in Belém that they should continue ramping up that ambition and – critically – develop implementation and investment plans to make sure it’s delivered. But the overwhelming message from commentators and analysts in response to the Belem COP30 result was “failure”.

Is there a future in which the shaky ground of multilateral cooperation can get us onto that 1.5C warming limit pathway? And are COPs the “least-worst system”, as the UK Energy Secretary Ed Miliband put it, to get there?

Politics in a “down phase”, trajectory still up

Politically, the last decade has been anything but linear. There have been high points – the adoption of the Paris rulebook, the net zero pledging bonanza of COP26, the first mention of fossil fuels in a globally agreed climate decision, the tripling‑renewables and doubling‑efficiency goals, and the launch of loss and damage funding arrangements. There have also been very visible setbacks, including major emitters backtracking, growing climate polarisation and heavily contested COP outcomes. This ebb and flow is one we have become accustomed to.

But the trajectory of climate action has remained upwards. Since 2015, climate framework laws have more than tripled, climate policy instruments have increased roughly seven‑fold and around three‑quarters of global GDP (rising to just over four‑fifths including sub‑national pledges) remains covered by some form of net‑zero target, even after the retreat of the US federal goal.

Our political “down” phase today is complicated by a more difficult and different geopolitical environment. Climate diplomacy now unfolds amid wars, deepening strategic rivalry, reshoring of supply chains, and intensified competition over critical minerals and industrial policy. International cooperation is shifting away from multilateral frameworks towards a more explicitly bilateral and transactional model, centred on packages of energy, infrastructure and security deals. This direction is reflected in ACS2 outcomes, the EU’s revamped Global Gateway strategy (and, in its extreme version, the latest US national security strategy.). While this can leave space for mutual interest, investment and agency for partner countries, it also risks shortening political time horizons, fragmenting standards and weakening incentives to invest in governance and social safeguards.

The future of the COP space

Against this backdrop, frustration with the COP process is understandable. The system is overloaded. The expectations are enormous. And we are still far from where science – and people on the frontline of climate impacts – say we need to be. Fossil fuel subsidies remain pervasive while adaptation and loss –and damage support lag, deepening existing inequalities, with disproportionate burdens on low-income households, marginalised communities and workers in carbon-intensive sectors.

We are right to question whether COPs are the right place to address this crisis. But COPs are not sentient actors that “fail” or “succeed” on their own. They are (precious) political and institutional spaces that deliver only what governments, institutions and societies choose to invest in them – in terms of ambition, negotiating capital and implementation capacity.

Big results like the Paris Agreement demand a huge diplomatic lift and just the right convergence of political conditions, that are clearly not in place now (as the latest IMO talks on shipping emissions showed). Fortunately, we don’t need another Paris Agreement moment. We have a permanent global architecture with five yearly cycles of countries sharing their nationally determined climate plans followed by collective global stocktakes and an ‘Action Agenda’ for driving the action of non-state actors like businesses and city governments.

The climate ambitious are already evolving how they use the COP space, adapting to the new mission for implementation. Recent years have seen coalitions of the willing on issues such as grids, storage and methane effectively compel Presidencies to create room for outcome documents, roadmaps and Presidency‑led initiatives that go beyond the minimum consensus text. The fossil fuel transition roadmap and pledges launched alongside the formal COP30 decisions follow this trend. This model could become a disciplined tool for implementation, if it can transform layers of pledges into actual policy frameworks.

Designing the next phase of climate governance in a new world order

The bigger test is whether these new COP tools can stand up to our evolving geopolitical landscape. This will require addressing the material constraints facing most of the world, above all debt and access to capital. For many emerging and developing economies, climate ambition is constrained not by lack of plans or ambition but by high borrowing costs, limited fiscal space and inadequate volumes of concessional and grant finance. It will also depend on finding ways to integrate trade, industrial and climate governance. A fossil fuel transition roadmap, for example, would need to convince states that they will have routes to prosperity outside their fossil fuel extraction models: clearly addressing the risks and providing economic feasible alternatives backed by international financial tools to enable them. A big ask in a geopolitical maelstrom.

Nonetheless, the entry into force of the UN High Seas Treaty in 2025 shows that states can still agree ambitious rules for protecting global commons even in a period of heightened international tension. Currently, major countries from the Global South are openly pushing back against anti-multilateral approaches to climate and energy, arguing instead for an international order based on shared rules rather than bilateral power-plays. Indonesian President Probowo’s UN General Assembly speech rallied a defense of multilateralism in stark contrast to US President Trump’s tirade. At April’s IEA Energy Security Conference, the US’ push to resurrect the fossil economy was met with defiance from energy transition allies. The evolving geopolitical order is not yet doomed to a fortress world.

The biggest strategic question for the next ten years is thus whether climate cooperation can become a structuring element of a new global order, rather than a casualty of its disorder. Can west, east and south define a shared floor of responsibility and support, even as they compete on technology and industrial capacity?",https://eccoclimate.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54908710444_2ba9a0ed18_c.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 17:56:42.191315
