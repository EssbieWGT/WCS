However, disagreements among member states over how the levy should be structured, administered and enforced led to the vote being postponed.
“It is important for me and for everyone to recognise that last week was not a normal IMO meeting,” Dominguez said.
However, member states remain divided over the scale and design of the levy.
“Whenever there were comments in the room, the most important thing is that the member states, the delegates, are talking to each other.","The Secretary-General of the International Maritime Organization (IMO), Arsenio Dominguez, has acknowledged the disruption caused by the postponement of the vote on the adoption of the IMO’s Net-Zero Framework, describing last Friday’s session of the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) as “not a normal IMO meeting”.

Despite the setback, Dominguez emphasised that the organisation remains united in its mission and continues to make progress towards decarbonising the global shipping industry.

Speaking at the Women’s International Shipping & Trading Association (WISTA) Annual General Meeting and Conference in Barcelona, Dominguez addressed the fallout from the extraordinary MEPC session, which was expected to advance a landmark proposal for a global levy on greenhouse gas emissions from international shipping.

The levy is central to the IMO’s plans to implement its 2023 Greenhouse Gas Strategy, which commits the sector to reaching net-zero emissions “by or around 2050”.

However, disagreements among member states over how the levy should be structured, administered and enforced led to the vote being postponed.

“It is important for me and for everyone to recognise that last week was not a normal IMO meeting,” Dominguez said. “We shouldn’t be rated as an organisation based on the postponement that took place, but instead on the fact that, like everybody else, we are dealing with different changes, different geopolitical situations, and we need to adapt.”

He added that the IMO had already resumed work on decarbonisation, with technical discussions beginning earlier this week to address key concerns raised during the meeting, including the management of the proposed climate fund, certification processes and the practicalities of implementation.

The proposed greenhouse gas levy is seen as one of the most significant measures in the IMO’s efforts to accelerate the transition to cleaner fuels and technologies.

Supporters argue that it would create a global financial mechanism to incentivise emission reductions while generating funds for developing countries to access low- and zero-carbon technologies.

However, member states remain divided over the scale and design of the levy. Developing nations, led by China, India and several African countries, have expressed concerns that the mechanism could unfairly impact emerging economies and increase trade costs, while others — including many European and Pacific states — are pushing for a globally applied price on carbon emissions from ships.

Dominguez, who took office as IMO Secretary-General in January 2024, urged patience and diplomacy, stressing that consensus-building is at the heart of the organisation’s mandate.

“Whenever there were comments in the room, the most important thing is that the member states, the delegates, are talking to each other. Those that had different views were in the same room, and we’re not going to find agreements right away, because we need to understand those comments and address them with further discussions and data,” he said.

“That is how multilateralism continues to work, and it is at the centre of everything that we do at IMO. So again, a silver lining — the member states are talking to each other.”

The delay at MEPC has prompted criticism from some climate advocates who argue that the shipping sector — responsible for nearly 3% of global carbon dioxide emissions — is moving too slowly to align with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C target.

Yet Dominguez insisted that the IMO’s record over its 70-year history shows resilience and adaptability.

“It’s easy for critics to judge the IMO’s success based on the events of last week, but we have decades of progress behind us — improving safety, security and shipping’s environmental performance. We are a strong organisation with a large and relevant programme of work,” he stated.

“During this week’s ISWG meeting, IMO member states have constructively engaged in preparing the guidelines that will be necessary once the NZF is adopted.
In its report on the progress of the working group, UK-based classification society Lloyd’s Register (LR) said the week-long meeting of delegations from IMO member states ""demonstrates the work is continuing"".
The IMO Secretariat also offered the working group a bit of insight into the status of the NZF, according to LR.","A coalition of non-governmental organisations following the progress of environmental regulations under discussion at the International Maritime Organization (IMO) in London have claimed that constructive dialogue remains underway on guidelines to support the yet-to-be-adopted measure which would add teeth to a general international agreement to decarbonise shipping operations.

An extraordinary session of IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) adjourned on 17 October 2025 without adopting a landmark treaty that could have – and may still – become the first legally-binding global rules setting out technical and economic measures that would lead an industry down a timeline of targets to decarbonise operations to the point of net zero.

Under discussion were additions to the maritime pollution treaty, Marpol, that includes the Net-Zero Framework (NZF). The NZF is made up of two main decarbonisation requirements: a global fuel standard to move away from heavily polluting fuels and a global GHG emissions pricing mechanism, often referred to as a carbon tax.

Allegations of behind-the-scenes diplomatic pressure tactics from the United States during the MEPC meeting surfaced in news reports that followed a vote to delay discussions to approve the amendment to the maritime pollution treaty by a year. Back-channel negotiations were also referenced during proceedings, including a mention by the chair of the MEPC, as ’corridor diplomacy’.

“While last week’s IMO decision to delay its Net Zero Framework was unwelcome, let’s be clear – this is just a postponement and not the end of the NZF”, Clean Shipping Coalition president Delaine McCullough said.

“During this week’s ISWG meeting, IMO member states have constructively engaged in preparing the guidelines that will be necessary once the NZF is adopted. This indicates broad support for the NZF and that progress can still be made on preparing for implementation.”

NGO Transport & Environment’s IMO manager Dr Alison Shaw said the negotiations this week advanced on the implementation guidelines for the NZF despite a lack of certainty about the future of the regulations.

In its report on the progress of the working group, UK-based classification society Lloyd’s Register (LR) said the week-long meeting of delegations from IMO member states ""demonstrates the work is continuing"".

Noting that the member states and the shipping industry more broadly evidenced ""some uncertainty"" around whether the working group would be convened at all given the delay to the NZF, the classification society said the IMO secretariat confirmed the working group was obliged to complete a set of actions determined and approved at the prior MEPC meeting in April 2025.

The IMO Secretariat also offered the working group a bit of insight into the status of the NZF, according to LR.

The IMO Secretariat is ""still analysing the impact of the adjournment"" of the extraordinary session in October 2025, LR said, but ""MEPC 84 will be able to consider the programming"" of the next extraordinary session to address NZF.",https://dvzpv6x5302g1.cloudfront.net/AcuCustom/Sitename/DAM/177/IMO_plenary_MEPC_83_IMO_1200w_Thumb.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 11:21:24.382409

However, according to LR, the Intersessional Working Group demonstrates that the work is continuing. The below are the main points from this week:

IMO is continuing to develop guidelines that are envisaged in the IMO Net-Zero Framework;

That MEPC 84 (April/May 2026) will discuss options around resuming MEPC ES.2 which is expected in October 2026;

Confirmation that ISWG-GHG 21 will still meet in April 2026, the week before MEPC 84; and

That the terms of reference for the 5th IMO GHG Study will be concluded at MEPC 84.

Consequential update as a result of the NZF not being adopted

There was some uncertainty if the ISWG-GHG would be convened this week in light of the adjournment of the MEPC ES.2. At the outset it was clarified that the ISWG-GHG must fulfil its terms of reference received from MEPC 83 (April 2025).

During the week the Member States sought clarity from the Chair and the Secretariat on what the adjournment meant for issues such as the ability to amend or work on the NZF before the resumption of the MEPC ES.2, as well as if further developing guidelines is relevant at this point in time.

The IMO Secretariat later offered some clarification on the work surrounding the Net-Zero Framework whilst acknowledging that the ISWG-GHG 20 terms of reference was not to consider this matter:

The IMO Secretariat is still analysing the impact of the adjournment of the MEPC ES.2;

MEPC 83 (April 2025) agreed the agenda for MEPC 84 (May 2026). There is a provisional agenda and Member States have been invited to attend;

The agenda for MEPC 84 includes item 13 on the work programme, where MEPC 84 will be able to consider the programming of the reconvened MEPC ES.2, including the exact dates it will take place;

ISWG-GHG 21 (takes place the week before MEPC 84) will pre-consider documents submitted to MEPC 84 that are within its terms of reference.

Guidelines supporting the NZF

MEPC ES.2 finalised a work plan to consider the proposed guidelines in support of the NZF. The work plan was subject to adoption of the NZF, which did not take place, so we believe it will be further confirmed at the MEPC ES.2 resumption expected in Autumn 2026. When considering the various guidelines, it was agreed to not conclude any specific requirements at this point and to use this time to share views in the hope of finding a consensus going forward.

Reward for the use of Zero or Near Zero GHG emissions fuels and technologies

When considering the design of a reward for the use of Zero or Near-Zero GHG emissions fuels and technologies, most delegations expressed a desire for the Reward to be fuel/technology and feedstock agnostic, but it was also acknowledged that there is a balance between rewarding fuels and technology available today versus longer term technology readiness. It was also noted that many want the reward to be simple in design and easy to manage. There is still a range of views on the reward with many asking for a flat reward for the first 5 years, but others want to consider auctions and other reward designs.

IMO Net-Zero Fund

It was concluded that further work was needed on a number of elements related to the implementation of the IMO Net-Zero Fund. This included:

Legal status of the governing provisions

Participation on non-Party and observer organisations in the Governing Board

The possibility of holding a GHG Expert Workshop to develop governing provisions of the Fund will be considered at MEPC 84.

GHG Fuel Intensity (GFI) and GFI compliance approaches

ISWG-GHG 20 focussed on exchanging views and not on concluding matters, noting the Net-Zero Framework adoption was adjourned, ISWG-GHG 20 invited delegations to work together intersessionally on development of guidelines on GFI compliance approaches and submit these to a future session.

Terms of Reference for 5th GHG study

The IMO’s 5th GHG Study is due to commence in 2026, with approval scheduled for Spring 2028. The IMO GHG Studies are used as a measure of the fleet’s emissions profiles, both as a measure of the success of existing regulations and to inform decisions on future regulations. The terms of reference were discussed and provisionally inter alia include:

Provide an inventory of total annual GHG emission series from 2018 to 2025/6, or as far as that is possible with the statistical data available.

Provide emission estimates for domestic and international voyages according to two methods – the “voyage-based allocation” and the “vessel-based allocation” of emissions.

Develop clear and unambiguous definitions and refine methods for differentiation between domestic and international voyages with the aim to exclude domestic voyages from the inventory for “international shipping” to mitigate the risk of the double counting of emissions from ships.

The emission estimate should include a thorough review of the methodology and assumptions used in the inventory forming part of the Fourth IMO GHG Study 2020, taking into account peer-reviewed/high-quality literature work undertaken since publication of the Fourth IMO GHG Study 2020.

Estimates of GHG fuel intensity should be included, along with the share of zero- or near zero fuels and energy sources. GHG fuel intensity should be provided in well-to-tank, tank-to-wake and well-to-wake phases.

The world fleet CO2 emissions and energy consumed (MJ) per transport work should be included for 2018-2025/6, based on the statistical data available.

Emission estimates are to ensure that tank-to-wake estimates are comprehensive and include fugitive emissions, operational releases, and both combusted and non-combusted fuel emissions.

Assessment of the embedded carbon of all equipment and infrastructure required for well-to-wake provision of the fuels and energy sources. This should include any depreciation, recyclability and other circular economy considerations for that pathway and vessels.

Further work will continue at MEPC 84 to approve the terms of reference and initiate the tendering process for the commencement of the study.

Fuel Lifecycle Assessment (LCA) Framework

It was noted that MEPC 84 (April/May 2026) is the next time the LCA Guidelines can be amended. The working group on Life Cycle GHG Intensity of Marine Fuels (GESAMP-LCA) may not be able to address all methodological issues whilst it prioritises the assessment of emissions factors which have been submitted to it. It was also acknowledged that there is a need to consider, within the LCA framework, ‘avoided emissions’ and ‘net-negative’ emissions fuels and technologies.

Outstanding unrelated MARPOL Amendments

It’s worth noting that a further consequence of the adjournment of the MEPC ES.2 meeting last week was that several amendments to MARPOL Annex VI were not adopted, although they have no impact on the NZF:

Designation of the North-East Atlantic Ocean as an Emission Control Area for SOx & particulate matter and for NOx.

IMO ship fuel oil consumption system (IMO DCS) data accessibility

Review of the short-term GHG reduction measure

Use of multiple engine operational profiles for a marine diesel engine related to NOx requirements

Clarification of entries in data reporting required by regulations 27 and 28

It is yet to be confirmed how or when these will be adopted. It could be that they are separated from amendments which are in adjournment so that they can be adopted before the NZF is further considered, and therefore they could be adopted separately.",https://safety4sea.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/54869642365_61e33ee609_6k-scaled-e1761310487382.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 11:21:33.368062

The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has voted 57-49 to postpone the adoption of the “net-zero framework” until October 2026. As the shipping sector’s first binding deal on global greenhouse gas emissions, the agreement would have established progressively stricter intensity limits starting in 2028. The framework also imposed substantial fees for noncompliance, with high emitters facing up to $1.5 million in additional annual fees by 2035 that could raise fuel costs by roughly 20%. Low-emission vessels would be rewarded with tradable carbon allowances.

The United States dominated discussions and actively worked to prevent the deal’s adoption, joined by other oil-exporting countries including Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Russia. President Donald Trump called the framework a “Global Green New Scam Tax on Shipping,” and US negotiators characterized it as an illegitimate international tax with dire economic consequences. Proponents of the deal faced threats of tariffs, new port fees, and visa restrictions during the talks, prompting them to decry the tactics as bullying which undermined years of multilateral climate work.

The Impacts of Aid Cuts on Refugees in Malawi (The New Humanitarian)

The UN refugee agency has received only 23% of the $26.3 million needed for 2025 operations at Dzaleka Refugee Camp in Malawi, which is home to 56,000 refugees from the DRC, Rwanda, Burundi, Somalia, and Ethiopia. These cuts have triggered a dramatic decline in essential services, as longtime UNHCR staff depart, offices stand empty, and equipment is sold off. Partner organizations like Plan International have withdrawn entirely from the camp, thus shutting down child protection, health services, education programs, and livelihood support.

Critical programs at Dzaleka also have disappeared, including youth-friendly health services providing contraceptives, HIV testing, and counseling. Other cuts include $50 monthly stipends for volunteer workers, as well as access to a youth center, while university scholarships are uncertain. The resulting desperation has driven increased theft and petty crime in the camp, pushing young women into survival sex work. Reduced oversight also has allowed human trafficking networks to flourish, and now leaves refugees without legal protection or advocacy against potential forced repatriation.

As Extreme Weather Spirals, the UN Calls for Worldwide Early Warning Systems (Al-Jazeera)

A new report by the UN’s World Meteorological Organization called for gaps in global monitoring and forecasting networks to be plugged, as climate-induced catastrophes increase. The agency found that nearly half of all countries lack early-warning systems for extreme weather events as natural hazards are expected to increase in frequency and severity in the coming decades. In the past 50 years, weather and climate-related hazards have killed more than 2 million people. Ninety percent of those deaths have occurred in developing countries.

The past decade has seen major progress in adoption to meet this challenge. The number of countries using a form of multi-hazard warning system has risen from 52 to 108. Yet half of 62 systems assessed by the organization operate at a basic capacity, while a further 16 percent work at less than basic capacity.

The US warned it could sanction countries voting in favour, arguing the plan would benefit China at its expense.
All EU countries except Greece and Cyprus opposed the delay, but their defection broke the bloc’s unity.
“The Commission is looking into the position taken by certain EU Member States during the voting process last week,” the spokesperson added.
According to an EU source, defecting from the bloc’s pre-agreed voting position may not have been illegal, but it was a “political disaster”.","The European Commission signalled on Wednesday that it is open to renegotiate the global net-zero shipping deal after the United States blocked it last week at the International Maritime Organisation (IMO).

An April agreement to cut CO2 emissions from shipping collapsed following pressure from Washington and Riyadh – which pushed through a one-year freeze to eventually axe it.

The US warned it could sanction countries voting in favour, arguing the plan would benefit China at its expense.

All EU countries except Greece and Cyprus opposed the delay, but their defection broke the bloc’s unity. The future of the deal – aimed at removing the dirtiest ships from the seas by mid-2030 – now hangs in the balance.

Asked by Euractiv whether the Commission supports Washington’s call for renegotiation, an EU spokesperson said: “We are ready to work towards building bridges with all other parties.”

Yet, the same official admitted, a new Council mandate “may potentially be needed.”

Because shipping decisions require unanimity, Athens’ resistance threatens to derail future coordination. “There will be time for changes to be made and to find common ground,” a senior EU diplomat said earlier this week.

Tensions first flared on Tuesday, when Greece held the COP30 mandate “hostage” to remove references to the IMO.

“The Commission is looking into the position taken by certain EU Member States during the voting process last week,” the spokesperson added.

According to an EU source, defecting from the bloc’s pre-agreed voting position may not have been illegal, but it was a “political disaster”.

Whether the Commission had issued an explicit instruction on the US proposal remains unclear.

The NZF outlines new requirements for shipping fuel greenhouse gas intensity, along with a pricing and reward mechanism.

Its adoption could help generate demand tailwinds for sustainable fuels such as green ammonia and e-methanol, with a regulatory framework seen as key to de-risking and unlocking investment in sustainable fuels and modern vessels.

Among the nations opposing carbon pricing in shipping are Saudi Arabia, Iran, Russia and the US.

Decision-makers are now scheduled to reconvene in October 2026, with the earliest possible implementation in March 2028.

Chile has a multibillion-dollar pipeline of green hydrogen and derivatives projects, primarily in the Magallanes and Antofagasta regions.

In a social media post, Mario Marchese, project director of the US$11 billion (bn) green ammonia initiative HNH Energy, currently in the permitting phase in Magallanes, said that while approval would have boosted demand, the momentum behind green hydrogen adoption remains solid.

“Enthusiasm remains strong,” he said. “The European market, led by Germany, has adopted hydrogen as a fuel in its energy matrix; Japan and South Korea are leading the adoption of ammonia in the power generation sector; and shipping companies from these same countries are continuing with plans to introduce ammonia-fueled vessels starting in 2028.”

Marchese added that expanding infrastructure in Magallanes was a vital piece of the puzzle, alongside local regulatory efforts.

“We are in a marathon, where endurance and resilience will be key to reaching the finish line. However, the constant imposition of new requirements, regulatory changes, and increased restrictions only serve to further prolong this race, while our competitors are clearing the path and making it easier to face the challenge,” he said.

Global consultancy Rystad Energy said the IMO’s decision, while creating uncertainty, would allow member states time to refine “ambiguous or contentious elements” and build a ""stronger, more implementable framework.""

Before the IMO meeting, Rystad’s maritime decarbonization team identified what it describes as gaps in the NZF that would need to be addressed.

“Decarbonizing the maritime sector is a complex challenge that goes beyond shipping, closely tied to the global shift from fossil fuels to renewables,” said Junlin Yu, vice president of supply chain research at Rystad. “Our findings suggest progress will likely lag behind the IMO’s current expectations due to infrastructure limits, technology readiness, and energy system interconnections. While the industry is committed, practical constraints demand a realistic approach. The IMO should use the extra year to refine the NZF into a more practical and equitable framework.”

Marcos Kulka, executive director of industry chamber H2 Chile, also posted online, pointing to the uncertainty created by the delay but noting that Chile could turn the extra time to its advantage.

“From Chile, we reaffirm our commitment to a green maritime transition, where the traceability of our export products is key,” he said. “We will continue to promote the technological, regulatory, and infrastructure developments needed to address the climate crisis, strengthening the country’s role as a reliable supplier of clean energy and sustainable solutions for the world.

“The delay does not change our course: it gives us time to be better prepared, more coordinated, and more determined. The maritime transition is moving forward, and Chile will be at the forefront of driving it.”

Shipping accounts for around 3% of global CO₂ emissions — a proportion expected to rise without an agreed decarbonization mechanism. Most countries from Europe, Latin America and Oceania supported advancing the NZF at the IMO meeting.

Green hydrogen can be combined with nitrogen to produce green ammonia or with recycled carbon dioxide to produce e-methanol. The versatile derivatives can be used as sustainable fuels or industry feedstocks.

BNamericas’ project database lists 70 active green hydrogen and derivatives sector initiatives in Latin America in the early works or planning phase.

In Chile and elsewhere, projects have started entering the environmental review phase.

This was in contrast to chaotic negotiations the week before, which led to the NZF adoption delay.

Progress on the Net-Zero Framework

The US, Saudi Arabia and other oil-producing countries responsible for the NZF adoption delay objected to any further work on the guidelines, deeming it premature until the NZF is adopted. This puzzled several delegates who pointed out that only last week the US and Saudi Arabia argued the NZF cannot be adopted due to key policy clarifications still missing.

Over the last two weeks, the US, Saudi Arabia and other petro-states engaged in textbook climate obstruction. Last week, they opposed the adoption the Net-Zero Framework for lack of detail. This week, they opposed discussing details ahead of adoption

… commented Christiaan de Beukelaer, Senior Lecturer in Culture and Climate at the University of Melbourne and an IMO observer.

Meanwhile, Jamie Yates, Climate & Renewable Energy Manager, Pacific Environment, said: “Despite last week’s delay tactics and bullying, we’ve moved past obstruction and into real progress with productive discussions now shaping the Net Zero Framework and how it will be implemented. We applaud the member states and industry leaders driving this forward.”

Luckily, this week, more voices joined the conversation, and the discussions took on a constructive and more respectful tone. It was a meaningful step toward rebuilding the confidence, transparency, and integrity we need to deliver the pollution cuts future generations deserve

… said Natacha Stamatiou, IMO GHG Lead, Global Shipping, Environmental Defense Fund.

Biofuels puzzling Member States

Countries disagreed on the role of biofuels in shipping’s clean transition, with Brazil, Indonesia and several African countries pushing for a “technology neutral” approach that would favour cheap, existing sources of biofuels, including food and feed stock (e.g. soy and palm oil). This is opposed by the EU and Pacific Island states, who are concerned about sustainability and scalability, and favour renewable e-fuels as a long-term solution.

Researchers, civil society groups and international campaigners have repeatedly warned against the use of food and feed-based biofuels on ships on environmental, climate and human rights grounds, and urge the IMO to disincentivise this fuel option. One way to do this is by considering the full lifecycle of emissions of marine fuels, including accounting of indirect land-use change (ILUC) emissions, in the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) guidelines.

The framework’s success will hinge on strong, coherent guidance that both incentivizes long-term green e-fuel production and use, and safeguards against unsustainable fuels, like crop-based biofuels, with uncaptured environmental impacts. Many member states acknowledged the importance of both aims, though uncertainty over the framework’s eventual adoption remained a clear backdrop to discussions

… Dr. Alison Shaw, IMO Policy Manager at T&E, stressed.

This has received the support of Mexico, UK, and several Pacific Islands who also expressed their concerns for addressing food security and environmental sustainability. The LCA guidelines are set to be finalised in April 2026.

Alternative energy sources and their role in reducing emissions

Member States and industry expressed broad support for the inclusion of wind propulsion as a zero- or near-zero (ZNZ) energy source alongside solar and shore power, recognizing their contribution to emissions reductions.

Wind propulsion is back in the spotlight at the IMO this week, with countries voicing support and industry data strengthening the case. The Net Zero Framework may be delayed but the work hasn’t stopped, and when adoption comes next year, implementation can be quick. Governments must now ensure that these guidelines enable a global scale up of wind propulsion

… explained Anaïs Rios, Shipping Policy Officer, Seas At Risk.

Furthermore, Gavin Allwright, Secretary General at International Windship Association (IWSA), pointed out that he technology is proven, scalable, and available globally today. Companies don’t have to wait for international regulation to catch up – they can make a sure bet on wind now and start reaping the benefits of a future-proof, truly zero-cost and zero-emissions energy source.

IMO Net-Zero Fund

Governments also discussed the IMO Net-Zero Fund, which according to experts must be equitable in order to ensure climate-vulnerable countries are not left behind in the transition. The Chair encouraged countries to consolidate their proposals ahead of the next round of negotiations in April.

We were pleased to see constructive discussions on the IMO Net-Zero Fund, ZNZ reward methodology and guidelines related to GHG Fuel Intensity (GFI). However, with the Net-Zero Framework hanging in the balance, and much more still to be discussed, it is as important as ever for States to prioritise justice and equity in their decision-making, and ultimately, to continue to push for the adoption of the Net-Zero Framework

… noted Emma Fenton, Senior Diplomacy Director at Opportunity Green.

The IMO’s latest talks on the Net-Zero Framework showed both progress and persistent divides — from debates over biofuels and e-fuels to renewed optimism around wind propulsion. After another round of negotiations, one big question remains:",https://safety4sea.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/54869582123_2ee16efcbc_k-e1761301682823.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 09:17:16.483081

“The Net Zero Framework may be delayed but the work hasn't stopped, and when adoption comes next year, implementation can be quick.
“Scaling back ambition at this critical moment would risk slowing the momentum needed to achieve meaningful progress in maritime decarbonisation.","As a meeting of the International Maritime Organization’s Intersessional Working Group on Reduction of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions from Ships (ISWG-GHG 20) closes in London, the Clean Shipping Coalition (CSC) applauds IMO Member States for rising above last week’s rancour - when the IMO decided to hold off on adoption for one year - by pushing ahead with preparations for adoption of the Net Zero Framework.

“While last week’s IMO decision to delay its Net Zero Framework was unwelcome, let’s be clear - this is just a postponement and not the end of the NZF”, said Delaine McCullough, Clean Shipping Coalition president. “During this week’s ISWG meeting, IMO member states have constructively engaged in preparing the guidelines that will be necessary once the NZF is adopted. This indicates broad support for the NZF and that progress can still be made on preparing for implementation.”

The IMO’s Net-Zero Framework is aimed at reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from ships, in line with its GHG Strategy. The NZF includes a global fuel standard (GFS), requiring ships “to gradually reduce how polluting its ship fuel can be (i.e. how much greenhouse gas is emitted for each unit of energy used, across a fuel's life cycle)”. It also includes a mechanism for setting prices on the GHG ships emit, to encourage the shipping industry to lower emissions as per the global fuel standard.

“IMO member states also don’t have to wait a year for the NZF to tackle shipping’s contribution to the climate crisis. At the IMO’s MEPC 84 meeting in April 2026 they will get a chance to slash GHG emissions and the cost of the energy transition by strengthening the Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII), the IMO’s cornerstone energy efficiency measure”, said John Maggs, Clean Shipping Coalition’s Representative at IMO. “By transforming the CII into an energy efficiency powerhouse, the IMO and its member states can quickly get shipping climate action back on course.”

“While adoption of the IMO Net-Zero Framework was paused last week, negotiations this week advanced on the implementation guidelines nonetheless”, said Dr Alison Shaw, IMO Manager at Transport & Environment. “The framework’s success will hinge on strong, coherent guidance that both incentivizes long-term green e-fuel production and use, and safeguards against unsustainable fuels with uncaptured environmental impacts. Many member states acknowledged the importance of both aims, though uncertainty over the framework’s eventual adoption remained a clear backdrop to discussions.”

“This week's meeting signaled that IMO member states will inevitably need to account more comprehensively for not only potential environmental harms but also human, health, social, Indigenous Peoples Rights and community wellbeing of the full well to wake marine fuels energy pathway”, said Andrew Dumbrille, Co-Founder and Director of Equal Routes. “Despite the implementation delay of the IMO's GHG framework, work continues in earnest to create a just and equitable path for the shipping sector to meet its 2050 net zero ambitions.""

“Wind propulsion is back in the spotlight at the IMO this week, with countries voicing support and industry data strengthening the case”, said Anaïs Rios, Senior Shipping Policy Officer, Seas At Risk. “The Net Zero Framework may be delayed but the work hasn't stopped, and when adoption comes next year, implementation can be quick. Governments must now ensure that these guidelines enable a global scale up of wind propulsion: One of the few solutions that cuts fuel bills, slashes emissions and keeps shipping competitive. The technology is here, now the rules need to catch up.”

“The global shift toward cleaner shipping fuels and technologies is already happening“, said Jenny Helle, Expert on Decarbonisation of Aviation and Shipping at Carbon Market Watch. “Scaling back ambition at this critical moment would risk slowing the momentum needed to achieve meaningful progress in maritime decarbonisation. This week, the IMO member states have shown support for the development of clear, enforceable, and science-based guidelines, robust life-cycle emissions accounting, a reward scheme for clean fuels and technologies, as well as revenue distribution to support the transition in small island developing states and least developed countries.”",http://static1.squarespace.com/static/677d25916da11d07add7c910/677e42da317bf233c28d75a0/68fb4ea106657a39130d4315/1761300216734/Screenshot+2025-10-24+at+11.02.58.png?format=1500w,N,,2025-10-24 06:16:28.159831

The Association emphasized the need to address retrofit and engineering challenges, potential safety implications, and efficient onboard surveys.

In response to a growing number of incidents involving container ships, IACS identified “Container Ship Safety” as a new work area. It said it would cooperate with marine insurers, including the International Union of Marine Insurance (IUMI), and other industry stakeholders to improve the regulatory framework related to fires, container losses, and structural design.

IACS highlighted cyber systems as another area of focus, citing the increasing impact of cyber incidents on ship safety, property, and the environment. The organization said it continues to strengthen its efforts to enhance vessel cyber resilience.

In its position on digitalization, IACS reaffirmed its commitment to support the maritime sector’s digital transformation, emphasizing a safety-oriented approach and regulatory compliance.

Addressing greenhouse gas emissions, IACS said it supports the IMO’s goal-based regulatory approach and will assist in developing detailed technical and operational requirements.

The Association also noted the importance of the human element in maritime safety and environmental protection, particularly as digitalization and decarbonization progress.

Regarding Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships (MASS), IACS said it intends to contribute its technical expertise to improve regulatory and technical standards for autonomous shipping. It also plans to develop instruments for the safe use of new fuels and technologies in line with the International Code of Safety for Ships Using Gases or Other Low-Flashpoint Fuels (IGF Code).

On underwater noise, IACS reiterated its position that the IMO should take the lead on developing global mitigation measures, while IACS focuses on harmonizing measurement procedures. Finally, IACS recognized nuclear propulsion as a potential option for maritime decarbonization and pledged to support the safe and environmentally responsible integration of nuclear technologies into ship design and operations.

Despite the postponement, the debate around the IMO’s Net Zero Framework has emphasised how the shipping industry’s decarbonisation will depend not just on fuel technology but also on financial equity, infrastructure readiness and regulatory credibility.
As Jefferies concludes, “the market may see near-term cost relief, but the long-term achievement of Net Zero ambitions remains deeply uncertain.”","The International Maritime Organisation’s (IMO) decision to postpone the adoption of its proposed Net Zero Framework has sent ripples through the shipping and energy markets, with analysts warning that the delay could reshape the industry’s decarbonisation path and distort investment in next-generation fleets.

According to Jefferies’ analyst Omar Nokta and his team, “a consequence of last week’s indecision will be a shift back to conventional fuel engines for new vessel orders and for many of those currently in the orderbook.”

Their analysis, issued following the IMO’s retreat, cautions that the organisation’s climate ambitions, a 40 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and net zero by 2050 relative to 2008 levels, are now in jeopardy.

For years, uncertainty over viable fuels had already weighed on newbuild demand, as the IMO’s long-term plans for a carbon pricing mechanism remained under negotiation.

Dual-fuel or alternatively fuelled vessels are considerably more expensive than their conventionally fuelled counterparts, with Jefferies estimating that dual-fuel “capable” ships, able to operate on alternative fuels from delivery, cost $10–15 million more than conventional or “ready” ships, which can be converted later.

Citing Clarksons data, Jefferies notes that while 41 per cent of the global orderbook now consists of dual-fuel or alternative propulsion vessels, only 16 per cent are equipped to use alternative fuels immediately upon entering service.

This has led to a growing trend of converting “capable” orders into “ready” configurations to lower capital expenditure, particularly for deliveries from 2027 onwards, when engine changes remain feasible.

“The trend of dual-fuel ship orders had leaned towards LNG,” Jefferies added, “amid concerns about methanol availability and ammonia safety.”

This was most visible during last year’s surge in containership newbuildings, when industry giants who had initially pursued methanol opted instead for LNG dual-fuel systems.

In this context, the postponement of the IMO’s Net Zero Framework, which would have introduced the first binding global carbon pricing mechanism under international law, has broader implications.

The framework would have required ships engaged in international trade to meet annual emissions-intensity limits, with non-compliant operators purchasing “remedial units” priced at $100 and $380 per tonne of CO2 equivalent.

These fixed-tier penalties were intended to incentivise the transition to low-emission fuels such as green methanol and ammonia, while generating an estimated $11–13 billion annually for a new Net-Zero Fund to support the fuel transition and climate adaptation projects.

However, experts warn that postponing the framework’s adoption risks delaying critical investment decisions and widening disparities between large and small operators.

Analysts at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy (CGEP), led by Evelyne Williams and Trevor Sutton, note that “large shipping firms are considerably more likely to absorb the added cost of remedial units and retrofitting their fleet,” thanks to access to capital, fuel contracts and credit trading mechanisms.

Smaller operators, they caution, will face greater difficulty meeting compliance costs, often resorting to slower operations or passing expenses to customers.

The Columbia team further emphasises that the impacts will vary across trade routes.

“On highly competitive routes, carriers have an incentive to absorb part of the compliance costs to protect market share,” they wrote, “whereas on routes with limited service or monopolistic conditions, carriers facing little competitive pressure are more inclined to pass the full costs on to consumers and exporters.”

The IMO’s framework also envisaged the Net-Zero Fund as a corrective mechanism to offset cost disparities between conventional and low-emission fuels, while supporting vulnerable states and smaller carriers.

Yet implementing such a mechanism within two years poses significant challenges. The IMO, primarily a regulatory body, would need to develop governance systems and disbursement protocols for one of the largest climate funds in the world, on a scale and timeline far exceeding that of the Green Climate Fund, which took five years to operationalise.

Without rapid progress, analysts warn that the compliance burden could hit small island developing states (SIDS), developing economies, and thin-margin carriers hardest, long before financial assistance is available. For many, the cost of compliance could translate into reduced service frequency, higher shipping rates, or slower speeds to conserve fuel.

Moreover, the framework’s fixed carbon prices could distort incentives by anchoring transitional fuels like LNG just below the penalty threshold, discouraging further innovation.

Without regular adjustments and coordinated investment in bunkering infrastructure, ship retrofits and safety standards, the sector risks becoming trapped in a “transitional compliance equilibrium”, meeting regulatory thresholds without achieving true decarbonisation.

Verification also remains a concern. Under the current design, monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) would rely heavily on self-reporting and national port authorities, exposing the system to inconsistencies and enforcement gaps across jurisdictions.

While major maritime hubs such as Rotterdam, Singapore and London are expected to anchor compliance globally, the risk of “dirty corridors”, older, higher-emission vessels confined to non-participating ports, remains.

Despite the postponement, the debate around the IMO’s Net Zero Framework has emphasised how the shipping industry’s decarbonisation will depend not just on fuel technology but also on financial equity, infrastructure readiness and regulatory credibility.

At SMM 2026, the global maritime flagship fair taking place next September, companies will showcase technologies driving the energy transformation of the global shipping sector.

It came as a blow: The member states of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) failed to achieve consensus on a global climate protection policy last week. The decision was postponed to next year. In an extraordinary session, the IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) discussed effective measures to implement the IMO climate goals, such as a global alternative fuel standard and an emission penalty for ships exceeding set limits.

But those dealing with the practical implications of these plans remain sceptical about the IMO’s climate ambition. This is one of the conclusions drawn by the SMM Maritime Industry Report 2025 (MIR) which summarises the responses of roughly 1,500 industry leaders surveyed by Hamburg Messe und Congress (HMC).

Roughly half of shipowners and suppliers (51 per cent) doubt that the net-zero goal can be achieved by 2050. 46 per cent of shipyards share this assessment. Just barely one third of respondents (29 per cent of shipowners, and 26 per cent of yards) are more optimistic. Market insiders such as yard manager and Chairman of the SMM Advisory Committee Dr. Klaus Borgschulte are not surprised: “After all we are talking about roughly 90,000 ships world-wide – a gigantic undertaking that can hardly be accomplished within the given time frame.”

Investing in the future

Despite these doubts, sustainability continues to range at the top of the industry’s agenda: 78 per cent of responding suppliers expect the issue to become even more prominent in the coming years. Nine out of ten companies are in the process of implementing specific measures, a marked increase from the previous survey (+ 8 per cent).

The IMO’s Net-Zero Framework is already reshaping investment decisions, operational strategies, and fuel choices across the maritime value chain, confirms Knut Ørbeck-Nilssen, CEO of DNV Maritime. According to the classification society’s Maritime Forecast to 2050, the number of climate-friendly ships is growing steadily. The supply of the required alternative fuels remains limited, however. Over the next ten years, the MIR survey participants expect the demand for LNG, biofuels, methanol and other hydrogen-based fuels to soar. In addition, hybrid propulsion solutions could play a key role, as well.

Efficiency is the new capital

“In the end, cost and availability will be the decisive factors,” points out Richard von Berlepsch, long-standing fleet director at the shipping company Hapag-Lloyd. There can be no doubt that alternative fuels will be more expensive than conventional ones, making efficient ship operations a crucial success factor for both newbuilds and vessels in service.

As a consequence, the industry puts the focus on retrofitting existing ships, implementing measures such as propeller and energy system upgrades, or installing exhaust gas treatment systems: According to the MIR survey, 78 per cent of shipowners are planning to invest in appropriate technologies, especially propulsion systems (66 per cent) and digital solutions (58 per cent). “Shipowners are willing to spend money,” says von Berlepsch.

Success through collaboration

“Generally there is confidence and a strong willingness to invest,” says Hauke Schlegel, CEO at VDMA Marine Equipment and Systems. “Our industry has the right technologies to lead the shipping sector to a climate-friendly future.” Schlegel believes close collaboration between the different stakeholders is key to taking the industry up to the next level.

Claus-Ulrich Selbach, Vice President Exhibitions Maritime & Energy at Hamburg Messe und Congress, emphasises: “Everyone involved understands there won’t be that one single technology solution to achieve the IMO’s zero-emission goal by 2050 – neither in terms of propulsion technology nor when it comes to energy sources. There will be a combination of many technologies enabling the shipping sector to achieve net zero, combined with operational efficiency enhancements including digitalisation and Artificial Intelligence. At SMM, decision-makers will find the full spectrum of technologies.”",https://cyprusshippingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/New-Project-19-2.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 06:16:59.122536
,,2025-10-24 09:11:13+00:00,Nature,Real-time rotational speed control and EEDI reduction research of rotor sail via high-Re ... - Nature,Not Available,,,,,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-21263-4,"There is a lack of research on the synergistic effects of ship speed, wind speed, wind direction, and rotational speed, especially the lack of real-time rotational speed control strategies in dynamic environments.
The ship speed at this speed also has the greatest impact on the R, and the nonlinear effect of ship speed on the R is particularly significant.
In addition, the relationship between wind speed and Cd undergoes significant changes near the critical wind speed (approximately 8 m/s).
As the wind speed increases, the Cd shows a sharp decrease trend with the increase of wind speed.
In view of this, this article innovatively constructs an effective power rose graph model for rotor sail, which can intuitively display the performance of rotor sail under different parameter combinations.","In 2023, the 80th session of the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC 80) adopted the ‘IMO Strategy on Reduction of Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Ships’, which clearly sets the goal of achieving net-zero emissions for global shipping by 2050, while continuing the phased requirement from the 2018 initial strategy that ‘the carbon intensity should be reduced by at least 40% by 2030 compared with 2008’. Against this backdrop, wind-assisted propulsion technology, as an important path for green shipping, has attracted increasing attention in its innovation and application. The maritime industry is advancing multi-faceted decarbonization to meet IMO’s targets, with key pathways including: alternative fuels (e.g., methanol, ammonia) as core deep decarbonization solutions; energy efficiency technologies (e.g., hull optimization, air lubrication); and operational measures. Within this landscape, wind propulsion technologies like rotor sails play a distinct role. As a renewable, zero-carbon auxiliary power source, they directly reduce main engine fuel consumption, offering advantages such as low operational costs, compatibility with existing vessels, and synergies with other solutions. So, the ancient and timeless concept of wind powered ship has been revived and innovated under the promotion of modern technology. Among them, the rotor sail stands out among various new wind propulsion technologies due to its high propulsion efficiency, and good adaptability to wind direction.

Rotor sails, also known as Flettner rotors, were invented by Anton Flettner in the 1920 s, marking the first practical application of the Magnus effect in ship propulsion. Since then, research and applications have continued throughout the 20th century. The fluid dynamics of flow around a rotating cylinder, the core principle behind rotor sails, is a long-standing topic in fluid mechanics. Early studies laid the foundation for understanding its basic characteristics, while modern research has deepened insights into specific conditions. Stojkovic et al.1, for example, conducted meaningful work under low Reynolds number conditions (Re ≤ 45), clarifying the independence between the drag coefficient Cd and the rotational ratio K in this regime, which enriched the theoretical framework for low-Reynolds-number rotating cylinder flows. Subsequently, Kang et al.2 further investigated the effect of the rotational ratio K on vortex shedding at Re = 60, 100, and 160. The results showed that the rotation of the cylinder could effectively suppress vortex shedding, providing new insights into the dynamic mechanism of the flow around the rotating cylinder. Considering the significant influence of rotational ratio on the flow field around a rotating cylinder, Liu Tianyu et al. and others3,4,5,6 conducted in-depth analysis of the nonlinear characteristics of the flow around a rotating cylinder under different rotational ratios within the range of Re ≤ 400, and established a theoretical framework for the K - Re coupling effect. They jointly promote the accumulation and innovation of knowledge in this field through mutual verification, expansion, and deepening. However, these studies are limited to lower Reynolds number ranges.

In response to the practical needs of engineering, research has shifted its focus to the high Reynolds number field (Re = 104 ~ 106) in recent years. Han et al. and others7,8,9,10 used numerical simulations to reveal the nonlinear characteristics of the flow around a rotating cylinder under high Reynolds number conditions, including the influence of Re on lift to drag ratio and the suppression of vortex shedding by rotational ratio. Additionally, Luo et al. and others11,12,13,14 studied the aerodynamic characteristics of rotating cylinder at different speeds and Reynolds number ranges from the perspective of model experiments, providing more comprehensive experimental data support for the flow field around rotating cylinders under conditions of larger Reynolds number ranges and different rotational ratios.

The lift coefficient, as one of the key parameters characterizing the aerodynamic performance of a rotating cylinder, has always been of great concern in the academic community. Prandtl15 proposed for the first time through groundbreaking experiments that there exists a theoretical limit value of 4π for the lift coefficient of a rotating cylinder. Chew et al.16 conducted numerical analysis on a rotating cylinder with a rotational ratio of 0 ≤ K ≤ 6 under Re = 1000. The results showed that when K = 6, the lift coefficient was 9.1, indicating that the Prandtl limit cannot be exceeded. However, there were disagreements in subsequent studies. Tokumaru et al.17 simulation study came to contradictory conclusions. They observed that under the condition of Re = 3.8 × 103, the lift coefficient exceeded the Prandtl limit when K = 10. The fundamental reason of this contradictory conclusion lies mainly in the differences in the basic condition parameters studied by both parties, namely the Reynolds number Re and the rotational ratio K. For a specific geometric shape of the rotor, the influence of K and Re on its aerodynamic performance is intertwined. The first scholar to jointly consider the influence of these two parameters on the aerodynamic performance of a rotating cylinder was Swanson18, who obtained the influence law of K and Re on the aerodynamic coefficient. Subsequently, the academic community conducted more detailed and in-depth research on these two parameters. Liu et al.19 found using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technology that within the range of Re = 0.5 × 105 ~ 1.0 × 105, the lift coefficient reaches its maximum at a rotational ratio of approximately 3.50. The numerical simulation results of Marco et al.20 show that within the range of Re = 1.28 × 106 ~ 5.11 × 106, both the lift coefficient and drag coefficient show an overall upward trend with the increase of the rotational ratio (K < 4). However, Bordogna et al.21 conducted a series of wind tunnel experiments on rotating wind sails and found that the Reynolds number Re had a significant effect on both lift and drag coefficients within the range of speed ratio K < 2.5. However, in the supercritical flow region (Re = 3.6 × 105, Re = 5.5 × 105, and Re = 1.0 × 106), the effect of Re on lift coefficient was not significant. These differential conclusions further demonstrate that the effects of K and Re on the aerodynamic performance of a rotating cylinder are interrelated. It is worth noting that the extended research on three-dimensional effects and multi cylinder interference22,23,24 has further enriched the theoretical system and provided important directions for the engineering optimization of rotor sail.

Expanding the application of rotating cylinders to the field of ships can provide additional thrust for ship navigation, thereby achieving the goal of energy conservation and emission reduction. This is the origin of rotor sail. The academic field has actively conducted research on the application of rotor sail in ship, mainly focusing on the key indicator of EEDI to evaluate the energy-saving effect of installing rotor sail on ship. Wang et al.25 systematically studied the energy efficiency characteristics of using sail assisted navigation technology on ocean going cargo ships through model experiments and CFD methods. They confirmed that using sail assisted navigation technology on large ocean going vessels can save fuel consumption and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, providing strong support for the application of sail technology in the field of ship energy conservation and emission reduction. Ammar et al.26 and Kume et al.27 conducted in-depth aerodynamic performance studies on ship equipped with rotor sail. They not only summarized in detail the thrust generated by the rotor sail, but also objectively evaluated its energy-saving effect, further enriching the understanding of the performance of the rotor sail. Gu et al.28 proposed an EEDI calculation method for sail assisted ships and successfully applied it to the world’s first sail assisted ultra large oil tanker. This practical application not only further verifies the effectiveness of sail technology in improving ship energy efficiency, but also provides valuable practical experience.

It is worth noting that the propulsion efficiency of a rotor sail does not exist in isolation, but is influenced by multiple factors such as its size, structural performance, and the wind conditions encountered by the ship. Gkoufas29 conducted in-depth research on this issue and developed a program for calculating EEDI values based on it, providing important theoretical basis and tools for the application of rotor sail in ship energy conservation and emission reduction. In addition, Zhang et al.30, Yu et al.31, Guzelbulut et al.32 conducted a comprehensive analysis of the economic and environmental benefits of installing sail on a real ship. Their research not only provides detailed data support for the academic field, but also provides strong practical examples for the application of sail technology in the field of ship energy conservation and emission reduction, further promoting the widespread application and development of this technology.

Through a detailed review and in-depth analysis of existing literature, it can be seen that the basic research methods and achievements of rotating cylinder flow provide direct and valuable references for the study of rotor sail. Specifically, research on rotor sail has covered multiple specific Reynolds numbers such as 103, 105, and 106. It not only delves into the mechanisms by which the rotational ratio K and Reynolds number Re affect aerodynamic coefficients, but also examines the practical application effects of rotor sail on ships, accumulating fruitful research results. However, there are still limitations in the current research scope regarding the application of rotor sail on ship, mainly focusing on the following three aspects:

① Insufficient coverage of Reynolds number. The actual Reynolds number of ships during navigation often exceeds 106, and existing research mostly focuses on a specific Reynolds number condition, which does not fully cover the Reynolds number range under conventional ship navigation environmental conditions.

② Lack of multi factor coupling. There is a lack of research on the synergistic effects of ship speed, wind speed, wind direction, and rotational speed, especially the lack of real-time rotational speed control strategies in dynamic environments.

③ Engineering validation is weak. Research on the impact of rotor sail on EEDI is still insufficient.

In response to the above issues, this study proposes the following innovative solutions:

① High Reynolds number aerodynamic model. Based on the two-dimensional unsteady N-S equation and the k - ω SST turbulence model, a numerical simulation framework covering Re = 1.076 × 106 ~ 4.719 × 106 has been established to cover the high Reynolds number environmental conditions of conventional ship navigation.

② Dynamic rotational speed control strategy. For the first time, a real-time control method based on effective power rose graph is proposed, which matches wind speed, ship speed, and wind direction through double interpolation algorithm to achieve global optimization of rotational speed.

③ EEDI engineering verification. Taking a 15,000 t bulk carrier as a case study, combined with the probability matrix of typical global wind conditions, quantifying the emission reduction benefits of rotor sail per unit height (EEDI reduction of 0.7%), providing data support for the IMO Phase III energy efficiency standards.

This study adopts a three-stage method of “theoretical modeling - numerical simulation - engineering verification”. Under appropriate rotational ratio conditions, a comprehensive analysis is conducted on the aerodynamic performance of ship rotor sail under various navigation conditions, taking into account four key factors: ship speed, wind speed, wind direction, and rotational speed. On this basis, draw a rose graph of the effective net power of the rotor sail under different sailing conditions to visually demonstrate its performance characteristics. Furthermore, based on the rose graph, a strategy for controlling the rotational speed of the rotor sail of a ship during actual navigation is proposed. This strategy aims to maximize the navigational benefits of the rotor sail by finely regulating the rotational speed of the rotor. Finally, a comprehensive evaluation of the impact of unit height rotor sail on the EEDI of ship provides strong theoretical support and practical guidance for the research and application of ship energy-saving and emission reduction technologies.

Determine the environmental conditions for calculation and analysis based on the actual navigation data of the ship, with a sail diameter D of 3 m. Among them, the common speed of ordinary merchant ships is taken as the ship speed, and the range of true wind speed covers winds from level 1 to level 8. As shown in the Table 2.

Based on the above data, the range of Re is calculated to be 1.076 × 106 ~ 4.719 × 106. The range of the rotational ratio K is 0.065 ~ 2.576.

Due to the numerous calculation conditions and the large amount of data results, it is not possible to present all the data results due to space limitations. Therefore, when discussing the influence of ship speed, wind speed, wind direction, and rotational speed on the aerodynamic performance of rotor sail, representative results are selected for discussion.

Combined effect of ship speed and rotational speed

To consider the influence of ship speed, this section presents the analysis results of the lift coefficient Cl, drag coefficient Cd, and lift to drag ratio R of the rotor sail when the true wind speed is 8 m/s, the rotation speed is 60 ~ 540 rpm, and the ship speed increases from 10 kn to 22 kn. Among them, the ship speed increases every 2 kn, and the true wind direction angle α is fixed at 90°. The aerodynamic performance analysis results are shown in Fig. 8.

From Fig. 8 (a), it can be seen that the minimum lift coefficient Cl of 1.77 occurs at a ship speed of 22 kn and a rotational speed of 60 rpm, while the maximum lift coefficient Cl of 15.23 occurs at a ship speed of 10 kn and a rotational speed of 300 rpm. There is a strong nonlinearity between Cl and ship speed and rotational speed.

(1) The speed of the ship has a significant impact on the Cl of the rotor sail. Overall, when the speed is maintained at 60 ~ 420 rpm, the Cl decreases with increasing ship speed, and the Cl is negatively correlated with ship speed. Especially when the speed is at 420 rpm, the decrease in Cl is particularly significant, with an amplitude of about 2/3. This phenomenon reveals that the Cl is highly sensitive to changes in ship speed in the low to medium speed range. Under a certain true wind speed, an increase in ship speed will lead to a significant reduction in Cl. However, when the speed increased to 540 rpm, the relationship between Cl and ship speed changed, and a positive correlation began to appear between them. At this point, as the ship speed increases, the Cl also increases, and the fluctuation of the Cl is relatively smooth throughout the entire range of ship speed changes.

(2) The rotational speed also has a significant impact on the lift coefficient Cl. Overall, the Cl reaches its maximum value at a speed of 300 rpm. Specifically, when the speed range is between 60 and 300 rpm, the Cl gradually increases with the increase of speed. This positive correlation reflects an important characteristic of the rotor sail system. When the speed increases, the flow velocity near the suction surface increases and the pressure decreases, while the flow velocity near the pressure surface decreases and the pressure increases. As a result, the pressure difference acting on the surface of the sail increases and the Cl increases. However, when the speed exceeds 300 rpm and continues to rise to 420 rpm, the Cl begins to show a negative correlation with the speed. This phenomenon indicates that when the rotational speed exceeds a certain critical point, the flow field around the rotor sail begins to become more unstable or turbulent. At this point, the phenomenon of airflow separation intensifies, meaning that the airflow no longer smoothly bypasses the surface of the rotor sail, but forms a complex vortex structure, resulting in a significant decrease in lift and an increase in drag. Therefore, although the rotational speed has increased, the effective lift of the rotor sail has decreased. At 300 rpm, the Cl reaches its maximum, and the sail can effectively utilize its own rotation and the flow of surrounding air to generate the maximum lift effect, which is crucial for the navigation efficiency of the ship.

From Fig. 8 (b), it can be seen that:

When ω = 60 rpm, the minimum drag coefficient Cd of 0.11 appears at a ship speed of 10 kn and a rotational speed of 120 rpm, while the maximum Cd of 1.64 appears at a ship speed of 10 kn and a rotational speed of 540 rpm. The Cd exhibits weak nonlinearity with respect to ship speed and rotational speed.

(1) When the rotational speed range is 60 ~ 120 rpm, the Cd is positively correlated with the ship speed. As the ship speed increases, the Cd slowly increases. This indicates that within this rotational speed range, the sensitivity of the Cd to changes in ship speed is relatively low. When the rotational speed range is between 180 ~ 540 rpm, the relationship between the Cd and the ship speed changes. Under this rotational speed, the Cd gradually decreases with the increase of ship speed, and there is a negative correlation between the two. It can be observed that when the rotational speed is low, the change trend of the Cd with increasing ship speed is relatively gentle. When the rotational speed reaches 300 rpm, the Cd is greatly affected by changes in ship speed, with the maximum value decreasing from 0.88 to the minimum value of 0.35. After the rotational speed reaches a certain critical point, the control efficiency of the sail is significantly improved and the resistance is reduced.

(2) In addition, the Cd gradually decreases first and then gradually increases with the increase of speed. This is because the aerodynamic force generated by the sail exhibits different characteristics in different rotational speed ranges. Under low-speed conditions, increasing the rotational speed makes the flow field more stable and reduces resistance. Under high-speed conditions, the flow field begins to become unstable, and fluid separation may occur, leading to an increase in Cd instead.

Figure 8 (c) shows the lift to drag ratio R of the rotor sail under different ship speeds, with a higher lift to drag ratio indicating better aerodynamic performance of the sail. Overall, the rotational speed range between 120 ~ 240 rpm exhibits a significant lift to drag ratio, with a maximum value of 77.09 occurring at a ship speed of 10 kn and a rotational speed of 120 rpm. The minimum R of 4.43 occurs under the conditions of a ship speed of 22 kn and a rotational speed of 60 rpm. Similar to the lift coefficient and drag coefficient, there is a strong nonlinearity between the lift to drag ratio and the ship’s speed and rotational speed. Specifically:

(1) The effect of ship speed on lift to drag ratio R varies under different rotational speeds. When the rotational speed is low, the R of the rotor sail gradually decreases with the increase of ship speed, indicating that the aerodynamic performance of the rotor sail gradually deteriorates. When the rotational speed is between 180 ~ 540 rpm, the R gradually increases with the increase of ship speed. This indicates that at medium to high speeds, an increase in ship speed helps improve the aerodynamic performance of the rotor sail. Especially at rotational speeds of 180 rpm and 240 rpm, the R is at its maximum. The ship speed at this speed also has the greatest impact on the R, and the nonlinear effect of ship speed on the R is particularly significant.

When the ship speed is in the range of 14 ~ 22 kn, the lift to drag ratio R is maximum at a rotational speed of 180 rpm. This indicates that within the speed range of the ship, selecting a speed of 180 rpm can maximize the aerodynamic efficiency of the sail. At other ship speeds, choosing a speed of 120 rpm is a better choice.

(2) At rotational speeds of 180 rpm and 240 rpm, the lift to drag ratio R is at its maximum. When the speed is within the range of 240 ~ 540 rpm, the R decreases with increasing speed. This means that under the same ship speed, the higher the rotational speed, the better the aerodynamic performance of the rotor sail may not necessarily be. Therefore, it is necessary to study the speed control strategy of the rotor sail under different conditions.

Combined effect of wind speed and rotational speed

To consider the influence of wind speed, this section presents the aerodynamic performance results of the rotor sail when the ship speed is 10 kn, the rotational speed is 60 ~ 540 rpm, the wind direction angle is 90°, and the true wind speed increases from 1 m/s to 20 m/s, as shown in Fig. 9.

Figure 9 (a) shows the lift coefficient of the rotor sail under different wind speeds. From the graph, it can be seen that the minimum lift coefficient of 0.95 occurs at a wind speed of 1 m/s and a rotational speed of 540 rpm. The maximum lift coefficient of 15.03 occurs at a wind speed of 8 m/s and a rotational speed of 540 rpm. The lift coefficient exhibits strong nonlinearity with respect to wind speed and rotational speed.

(1) The wind speed has a significant impact on the lift coefficient of the rotor sail. Overall, when the rotational speed is 60 ~ 240 rpm, the lift coefficient Cl decreases with increasing wind speed, and the Cl is negatively correlated with wind speed. Especially at a rotational speed of 120 rpm, when the wind speed increases from 1 m/s to 20 m/s, the maximum and minimum Cl differ by nearly 10 times. However, when the rotational speed is increased to the range of 300 ~ 540 rpm, the change in Cl with wind speed exhibits more complex nonlinear characteristics: first gradually increasing, and then gradually decreasing. This phenomenon reveals the existence of a critical rotational speed, and once the rotational speed crosses this critical value, the mechanism by which wind speed affects the Cl undergoes a fundamental change. Specifically, under low rotational speed, the airflow velocity on the windward side of the rotor surface is relatively slow. As the wind speed increases, the boundary layer separates, reducing the generation of effective lift. Therefore, under low rotational speed, an increase in wind speed will significantly reduce the lift coefficient Cl. In contrast, under high rotational speed conditions, the airflow velocity on the windward side of the rotor surface is opposite to the incoming flow velocity, and there is a significant difference between the two velocity values. As the wind speed increases, the rotor sail will experience dynamic stall phenomenon. This complex fluid dynamics process results in a significant nonlinear relationship between lift coefficient and rotational speed under high rotational speeds.

(2) Similarly, considering different wind speeds, the average maximum lift coefficient Cl is obtained at each wind speed at a rotational speed of 240 rpm. Specifically, when the rotational speed is 60 ~ 240 rpm and the wind speed is greater than 8 m/s, the Cl increases with the increase of rotational speed, and the Cl is positively correlated with rotational speed. But when the wind speed is less than 8 m/s, the Cl under a rotational speed of 240 rpm is greater than that under rotational speeds of 300 rpm, 420 rpm, and 540 rpm. Indicating that increasing the rotational speed under higher wind speeds helps enhance the ability of the rotor sail to capture and utilize wind energy. It also indicates that under lower wind speeds, excessively high rotational speeds may cause the airflow on the surface of the rotor to become unstable, generating eddies or turbulence, thereby reducing lift. Therefore, it is not advisable to use excessively high rotational speeds under lower wind speeds.

(3) In the range of 300 ~ 540 rpm, the Cl is negatively correlated with the rotational speed, and a wind speed of 15 m/s is a turning point for the Cl. When the wind speed is less than 15 m/s, the Cl decreases with the increase of rotational speed, and it is not advisable to increase the rotational speed of the rotor to improve the Cl. When the wind speed is greater than 15 m/s, the Cl increases with the increase of rotational speed, that is, increasing the rotational speed can make the rotor better utilize wind energy, thereby improving the lift coefficient Cl.

Figure 9 (b) shows the drag coefficient Cd of the rotor sail under different wind speeds. It can be observed that:

(1) Only at a rotational speed of 60 rpm, the Cd gradually increases with the increase of wind speed. This indicates that under low rotational speeds, the interaction between the rotor sail and the wind is relatively stable, and the flow field remains relatively stable. The flow mainly exhibits laminar characteristics, with less generation of turbulence and eddies, resulting in lower flow resistance. As the wind speed increases, the energy of the flow gradually increases, and the flow field begins to deviate from the original laminar state. The formation of turbulence and eddies becomes more significant. These unstable flow phenomena lead to an increase in resistance coefficient, where the viscous and inertial effects in fluid flow become more pronounced, thereby increasing resistance.

(2) Under other rotational speeds, the Cd gradually decreases as the wind speed increases. This indicates that under higher rotational speeds, an increase in wind speed improves the flow field around the rotor, resulting in a decrease in the pressure difference of the upwind vortex. In addition, the relationship between wind speed and Cd undergoes significant changes near the critical wind speed (approximately 8 m/s). Under low wind speeds (less than 8 m/s), changes in wind speed have a significant impact on flow characteristics. As the wind speed increases, the Cd shows a sharp decrease trend with the increase of wind speed. When the wind speed exceeds 8 m/s, the impact of the increase in wind speed on the flow field gradually weakens, the turbulence characteristics begin to stabilize, and the change in Cd tends to be stable, showing a relatively gentle trend.

Figure 9 (c) shows the lift to drag ratio R of the rotor sail under different wind speeds. From the figure, it can be seen that:

(1) There are significant differences in the effect of wind speed on the lift to drag ratio R under different rotational speeds. Under a rotational speed of 60 rpm, the R of the rotor sail gradually decreases with increasing wind speed. This is because as the wind speed increases, the impact of lower rotational speeds on the surrounding flow field is relatively small, resulting in a gradual deterioration of the aerodynamic performance of low-speed rotor sail. When the rotational speed is higher than 240 rpm, the high-speed rotation of the rotor sail has a significant impact on the wake flow field, effectively suppressing the release of vortices in the wake flow field. As a result, the aerodynamic performance of the rotor sail gradually improves with the increase of wind speed. However, when the rotational speed is 120 rpm and 180 rpm, the flow field characteristics of the rotor sail are in a transitional state, and the wind speed has a significant impact on the lift to drag ratio R, showing a nonlinear correlation between the two. Under this condition, the R first increases and then decreases with the increase of wind speed.

(2) When the wind speed is the same, it is not necessarily the higher the rotational speed, the better the aerodynamic performance of the rotor sail. Under low wind speeds, low-rotational-speed aerodynamic performance is better. While under high wind speeds, the aerodynamic performance under a rotational speed of 240 rpm is relatively better.

The influence of wind speed and rotational speed on the aerodynamic performance of rotor sail is complex and nonlinear, therefore it is necessary to study the control strategy of rotor sail based on wind speed.

Combined effect of wind direction and rotational speed

To consider the influence of wind direction, this section presents the aerodynamic performance results of the rotor sail when the ship speed is 10 kn, the true wind speed is 8 m/s, and the wind direction angle increases from 0° to 180°. The wind direction angle increases every 15°, as shown in Fig. 10.

Figure 10 shows the variation curves of the lift coefficient Cl, drag coefficient Cd, and lift to drag ratio R of the rotor sail under different wind directions. From Fig. 10 (a), it can be seen that:

(1) The effect of wind direction on the Cl of the rotor sail varies under different rotational speeds. Under low rotational speeds (60 ~ 120 rpm), the rotation of the sail has a limited impact on the flow field. At this time, the Cl mainly varies with the change of wind direction, and is less affected by the change of rotational speed. As the wind direction angle increases, the relative angle between the windward side of the rotor sail and the airflow becomes more favorable. The adhesion effect of airflow in the flow field is improved, resulting in a gradual increase in Cl. This indicates that the interaction between the surface of the rotor sail and the airflow is gradually optimized, and the sail exhibits a relatively stable and linear aerodynamic response.

(2) However, when the rotational speed increases to a certain range, the trend of the Cl shows complex nonlinear characteristics. The Cl first decreases when the wind direction angle is small, then rebounds and reaches its maximum value, and decreases again when the wind direction angle continues to increase. At this point, the rotation of the rotor sail has a more significant impact on the surrounding flow field, especially in inducing phenomena such as fluid separation and vortex formation. This leads to the flow field no longer being a simple stable airflow, but becoming more complex. The generation and disappearance of vortex structures, in turn, affect the aerodynamic characteristics of the rotor surface, causing the Cl to exhibit fluctuating changes.

(3) In addition, the maximum Cl is associated with different wind direction angles under different rotational speeds. This indicates that the sensitivity of the aerodynamic performance of the rotor sail to wind direction depends on the rotational speed. Under low rotational speeds, the rotor sail may maintain a relatively stable aerodynamic effect, and small changes in wind direction angle may have a significant impact on the Cl. Under high rotational speeds, due to the complexity of the flow field, the optimal wind direction angle changes accordingly. This change reveals the diversity of optimizing the aerodynamic characteristics of rotor sail, as different speeds may require different control strategies to achieve optimal performance.

From Fig. 10 (b), it can be seen that:

(1) When the rotational speed is below 300 rpm and the wind direction angle is small, the drag coefficient Cd of the rotor sail shows less sensitivity to changes in wind direction angle. Under low rotational speeds, the airflow velocity is low, the flow field is relatively stable, and the frictional force and airflow separation phenomenon on the surface of the sail cause less disturbance to the flow structure. Therefore, the change in wind direction angle has no significant impact on the aerodynamic performance around the sail, and the change in Cd is relatively gentle. Within this rotational speed range, as the wind direction angle increases, the sensitivity of the Cd to the wind direction angle increases.

(2) When the rotational speed exceeds 300 rpm, the flow field of the rotor sail becomes sensitive to changes in wind direction angle. At this point, as the wind direction angle increases, the aerodynamic effects on the rotor sail become more complex, and the Cd shows a nonlinear trend of change. The Cd decreases with the increase of wind direction angle, which may be related to changes in airflow separation mode and adjustments in rotor sail surface adhesion. As the wind direction angle further increases, the airflow separation becomes more severe, and the wake structure changes, resulting in a further increase in Cd. This phenomenon reflects the nonlinear response of the flow field around the rotor, and the vortex structure of the flow field has a more significant impact on aerodynamic drag.

From Fig. 10 (c), it can be seen that:

(1) Under different rotational speed conditions, the variation law between lift to drag ratio R and wind direction angle has a similar trend: as the wind direction angle increases, the R gradually increases, and after reaching a peak, it begins to gradually decrease. However, it is worth noting that the wind direction angle at which the maximum R occurs will vary with different rotational speeds. This indicates that there is a significant correlation between the optimal aerodynamic performance of the rotor sail and the wind direction angle, and this optimal performance is adjusted with changes in rotational speed. Therefore, it is necessary to study the control strategy of rotor sail to ensure optimal aerodynamic efficiency under different operating conditions.

(2) Under the same wind direction angle, the R shows a trend of first increasing and then decreasing with the increase of rotational speed. Specifically, when the rotational speed is low (below 180 rpm), the R gradually increases with the increase of speed. When the speed exceeds 180 rpm, the R begins to show a decreasing trend. It indicates that under low rotational speed, the disturbance of the surrounding flow field by the rotor sail is relatively small, making the flow field more stable and thus beneficial for improving aerodynamic performance. However, as the rotational speed increases, the influence of the rotor sail on the flow field gradually strengthens, and the instability of the flow field increases, leading to a decrease in aerodynamic performance. Therefore, under the same wind direction angle conditions, low rotational speed can usually achieve a higher lift to drag ratio R, thereby improving the aerodynamic efficiency of the rotor sail.

Based on the above discussion, it can be concluded that ship speed, rotational speed, true wind speed, and its direction collectively constitute the key factors affecting the aerodynamic performance of rotor sail. The wind speed and direction in the sea area where ships navigate are dynamically changing, and ship speed is not always constant. In order to maximize the efficiency of wind energy utilization, how to accurately match these parameters to achieve the optimization of the aerodynamic performance of the rotor sail has become an important consideration that cannot be ignored in the operation of the rotor sail in shipping driving. In view of this, this article innovatively constructs an effective power rose graph model for rotor sail, which can intuitively display the performance of rotor sail under different parameter combinations. Furthermore, a control strategy for rotor sail based on rotational speed regulation was proposed, aiming to optimize the aerodynamic performance of the rotor sail by flexibly adjusting the rotational speed, thereby ensuring the maximum utilization of wind energy under various sailing conditions.",https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-025-21263-4/MediaObjects/41598_2025_21263_Fig1_HTML.png,N,,2025-10-24 06:17:03.445287

“This year’s Annual Summit has provided a crucial opportunity for leaders from across the globe and maritime value chain to come together address some of the sector’s most pressing issues, including what needs to happen over the next year to set the stage for the adoption of the NZF,” said Global Maritime Forum CEO Johannah Christensen. “One of the overwhelming messages I’ve heard from participants over the last two days is how hopeful and energised they feel after the Summit, particularly coming off the back of such a disappointing outcome last week. The mood has certainly shifted.”

Throughout the Summit, IMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez also encouraged assembled industry leaders to think of the NZF delay as a pause of the adoption itself, but certainly not a pause on the work underpinning the framework.

“Shipping continues to be a global industry, and as such, needs global regulations. Yes, we have paused now on the adoption, but the work on the implementation continues,” he said in a video interview. “This extra year gives us the chance to connect with all the stakeholders and parties in order to address the questions that were raised, including the lack of clarity around the framework,” he said at a press event.

One of the themes that emerged from Summit discussions was the important role of the EU and China, as well as developing regions like Africa, as emerging centres of supply and demand for zero-emission fuels and champions that can reaffirm the support for the NZF that existed when it was agreed in April.

Shanghai to host 2026 Summit

China’s significance was underscored with the announcement that next year’s Annual Summit will be held in Shanghai, an important global maritime hub and home to one of the world’s busiest container ports.

The 2026 Summit will be supported by Shanghai Maritime University and the People’s Government of Hongkou District.

“Shanghai Maritime University is pleased to collaborate with the Global Maritime Forum, Shanghai Municipal Transportation Commission, and Shanghai Hongkou District in providing support to the Annual Summit 2026. We look forward to contributing toward an event that will bring the industry together to help drive the energy transition and digitalisation of the shipping industry,” said a representative of Shanghai Maritime University.

“Hongkou District extends its warmest welcome and steadfast support for the Global Maritime Forum Annual Summit 2026 to be held next October. As a core functional zone of the Shanghai International Shipping Center, Hongkou boasts a rich history and profound maritime heritage, having previously gathered many of the world’s leading ports, shipping enterprises and institutions,” said a representative of Hongkou District.

Evolution of the All Aboard Alliance

On the second day of the Summit, the All Aboard Alliance launched its new 2030 strategy and industry ambitions for making at-sea careers more safe, attractive, and inclusive.

“With this new strategy underpinning our work, the All Aboard Alliance community can begin addressing the deep-rooted, systemic challenges facing the roughly two million seafarers who are the backbone of global trade,” said Global Maritime Forum Director of Human Sustainability Susanne Justesen. “It will require us to question these entrenched structures, ask hard questions, and confront uncomfortable truths—and it’s something none of us can do alone. We invite companies to join us in working towards a future where seafarers are at the heart of every voyage.”

The Alliance aims to track progress annually and build transparency, showcase what good looks like by defining better standards for living and working at sea, and align financial incentives towards industry adoption of those standards.

New governance taskforce convened

A key theme that has emerged in recent years is the need for strengthened governance to address uncertainty and geopolitical risks.

In Antwerp, assembled industry leaders expressed growing concern about the dark fleet putting the environment and crew safety at risk. Participants pledged to establish a task force, comprised of industry leaders from across the value chain, to explore ways to address gaps in the enforcement of maritime governance. The task force will convene in the coming weeks and present its initial actions by next year’s Summit.

The 2025 Summit was supported by partners CMB.TECH and the Port of Antwerp-Bruges.

“CMB.TECH is delighted to have partnered with the Global Maritime Forum for this year’s Annual Summit in Antwerp, the beating heart of maritime Europe,” said Alexander Saverys, CEO of CMB.TECH. “Now more than ever, our industry needed to come together to debate about trade, peace, and the future of our planet, all of which are under threat. But this is not our first shipping crisis. For more than 4,000 years, maritime men and women have proven that perseverance, vision, and bravery can make the world a better place. Energised by the positive shipping vibes at the Antwerp Summit, CMB.TECH will continue do its part.”

Yet despite this fall, the European Commission’s EU Transport in Figures 2025 publication strongly underscores the enduring strategic importance of heavy freight and breakbulk logistics across the continent’s multimodal network.

Road transport, which takes in the more niche abnormal or ‘mega-loads’ sector, continued to dominate, with more than half of total inland volumes (52.6 per cent), but its share has levelled off amid higher fuel costs, driver shortages, and sustainability pressures. Rail accounted for 11.5 per cent and inland waterways for 3.4 per cent, both serving as critical modes for high-density and project cargo, from industrial machinery and steel to renewable energy components.

Resilient

Short-sea shipping within the EU remains a cornerstone for breakbulk movements, handling roughly 30 per cent of all freight tonne-kilometres. The segment has proven resilient, connecting Northern European, Baltic, and Mediterranean ports and offering a lower-emission alternative for heavy cargoes that cannot easily shift inland.

On infrastructure, the EU’s transport backbone now comprises 77,000 km of motorways, 201,000 km of active rail lines, and 50,000 km of navigable inland waterways. Over half of the rail network is electrified – a crucial enabler of the bloc’s modal-shift ambitions under the TEN-T policy.

Multipurpose

Meanwhile, Europe’s merchant fleet, representing 39 per cent of world gross tonnage, continues to supply significant multipurpose and Ro-Ro capacity for project cargo flows.

The goal is to cut emissions of black carbon, a powerful climate pollutant produced by burning fossil fuels. The deadline for submitting formal proposals to the IMO’s pollution prevention committee (PPR13) is December 5, 2025. According to Dr. Sian Prior, Lead Advisor to the Alliance, a Nordic resolution would signal strong regional support for protecting the Arctic from shipping emissions ahead of the IMO’s critical session in February 2026.

Black carbon, which is over 3,000 times more potent than CO₂ over a 20-year period, contributes around 20% of shipping’s total climate impact. When released near the Arctic, it settles on snow and ice, accelerating melting and reducing the Earth’s albedo effect, its ability to reflect sunlight, thereby intensifying regional and global warming.

Despite its severe impacts on climate and human health, maritime black carbon emissions have more than doubled in the past decade. The Clean Arctic Alliance argues that switching ships operating in or near the Arctic to distillate fuels (such as DMA or DMZ), which produce far less black carbon, offers a simple, immediate solution. While land-based sources have long faced regulations to curb such pollution, similar standards have not yet been implemented at sea.

A recent submission to the IMO (MEPC 82/5/2) by NGOs calls for the inclusion of a polar fuels regulation in MARPOL Annex VI, defining specific low-emission fuels for Arctic operations.

The storm

From 14-17 October 2025, when the Net-Zero Framework measures were due to be adopted, a storm blew into the IMO and swept it off course.

Intense lobbying and filibustering from petrostate Saudi Arabia and blatant threats from the United States created chaos and confusion. Ultimately a decision was made to defer the decision by 12 months by adjourning the meeting.

This was a bitter disappointment to the many stakeholders who have worked hard to make shipping one of the only hard-to-abate sectors with a global decarbonisation target, together with realistic measures to practically achieve it.

Overview of the shipping sector

For context, the global shipping sector is the backbone of international commerce, and yet it is largely out of sight and out of mind for most people.

It is a sector which has transformed dramatically in the last century, in terms of the size and number of ships it employs, the volume of goods it transports, the technologies it uses to standardise cargo handling and to facilitate inter-modal transfer of this cargo, the energy it uses for ship propulsion, the technologies it has adopted to increase safety for mariners, and the connection of bodies of water via canals to reduce shipping distances and timeframes.

Ships transport 80-90% of international trade (but only 11% of the economy’s material footprint).

The global merchant fleet surpassed 2.40 billion deadweight tonnes (DWT) in 2023–24, comprising more than 106,000 merchant ships over 100 Gross Tons (GT) and almost 70,000 ships over 300 GT.

Shipping fuels are cheap but are highly polluting. They are essentially the thick sludge at the bottom of the barrel of the oil refining process. The shipping sector consumes around 300 million tonnes of fuel annually, which emits around 1 billion tonnes of CO2 per year.

If the shipping sector was a country, it would emit more than Germany and more than double that of Australia. And on a business-as-usual trajectory, shipping emissions are projected by the IMO to rise by as much as 40% by 2050.

Notably, almost 40% of all shipping (by volume) is involved with transporting energy commodities in the form of crude oil, refined petroleum products, liquefied natural gas (LNG), liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), and coal.

This makes energy the largest single category in global seaborne trade, ahead of bulk agricultural goods or containerised cargo.

The dominance of fossil-energy transport means that shipping is deeply intertwined with the fossil fuel economy, both as an enabler and as a consumer.

Decarbonising shipping thus means tackling both the fuel used by ships, and fuels transported by ships. Even if ships become carbon-free, the sector’s role as the carrier of fossil energy will continue to link it to global emissions until energy trade patterns shift.

No wonder the petrostates unleashed a storm upon the IMO.

Decarbonisation pathways

How to decarbonise such a sector? Much of the effort has focussed on alternative fuels like methanol, hydrogen, ammonia, LNG and biofuels.

None of these is the silver bullet: hydrogen and ammonia will be very expensive initially, particularly if produced using renewables rather than steam methane reforming, which is highly emitting.

Combustion of LNG emits less than shipping fuels, but methane leaks in the production, transport and storage of LNG limit its decarbonisation outcomes. And methanol and biofuels are hard to scale due to feedstock limitations.

Other initiatives use operational measures such as slower steaming, improved ship routing and port scheduling, and better use of shore power to switch off onboard generators whilst in port. All of these help, but pale in comparison to the emissions from burning dirty fuels.

Are there other things which can have quick impact at scale? Well yes, actually there are. They’re blowing in the wind.

Wind assisted ship propulsion

I have just returned from a Churchill Fellowship to investigate the potential for wind assisted ship propulsion (WASP) for commercial shipping. I visited leading innovators in Singapore, the UK, France, the Netherlands, Germany, Denmark and the Marshall Islands.

I was pleasantly surprised by what I learned:

Currently, 77 large merchant ships have been installed with wind propulsion systems and a further seven are “wind-ready”: awaiting or undergoing WASP installation. (WASP vessel tracker).

This corresponds to over 4.3 million deadweight tonnes (DWT) of shipping. More than 130 ship installations of WASP systems are on order, most for delivery in 2025/26. By the end of 2025, there should be 100 ships installed. The number of ships installed with WASP roughly doubles each year.

It feels like the early days of solar PV, 20 years ago, before installed capacity skyrocketed.

Innovators have been quietly bubbling away for the last 10-15 years developing new WASP technologies or refining old ones with modern materials and computerised controls.

British company BAR Techologies has used experience from Formula 1 car racing and America’s Cup yacht racing to develop WindWings, a 37.5m tall, solid wing sail which looks like a vertical aircraft wing with its flaps extended for landing.

Two to four powerful WindWings can be fitted to tankers and bulk carriers, either as retrofits or on newbuilds. On average, each wing sail saves one and a half tonnes tonnes of fuel / four and a half tonnes of carbon dioxide per day.

Image: Andrew Dickson

Union Maritime’s newbuild tanker fitted with WindWings, Brands Hatch, had a stunning maiden voyage in which her three WindWings sails avoided 12.8 tonnes of fuel use / 38t of CO₂ in just 24 hours. Sustained peak performance of over 18 tonnes per day was seen for a full six hours.

This was achieved whilst fully laden and whilst maintaining strong sailing speeds in challenging weather. In favourable conditions, the vessel achieved more than a third of its propulsion from wind power alone, proving the ability of the WindWings to deliver not only impressive peak results but also reliable efficiency over extended periods.

Image: Andrew Dickson

Tens of thousands of vessels could be fitted with solid wing sails, or with Flettner rotors like those supplied by Anemoi Marine Technologies (UK), Norsepower (Finland), Eco Flettner (Germany), Dealfeng (China) and others.

French company Neoline just commenced commercial operations with a newbuild, 136m, roll-on roll-off ship with a cargo capacity of 6,300 tons, capable of carrying up to 321 cars, 265 x 20-foot containers, or 125 x 40-foot containers.

Image: Andrew Dickson

It will be powered by two huge SolidSails from another impressive French company, shipbuilder Chantiers de l’Atlantique (https://chantiers-atlantique.com/en/). Three of these SolidSails have also been been fitted to the new luxury cruise liner Orient Express Corinthian, which, when commissioned, will be the largest sailing yacht in the world.

At a smaller scale, French company TOWT operates two 81m wind powered vessels which transport products all over the Atlantic with carbon emissions that are less than 1/10th those of regular ships. TOWT is expanding rapidly, with six more wind-powered ships currently under construction in Vietnam.

And in our backyard in the Pacific, the wind-powered cargo ship the SV Juren Ae was commissioned by the Republic of the Marshall Islands in July 2024 after several years of contribution and funding from Germany through a project called Expanding Low-Carbon Sea Transport in the Republic of the Marshall Islands (LCST).

Juren Ae uses wind power to resupply the communities living on atolls spread across its two million square kilometers of territorial waters, and reduces the need for expensive imported shipping fuels, improving RMI finances.

Low-lying islands in the Pacific are existentially threatened by rising sea levels, and wind-powered cargo ships are a tangible and practical way that Pacific nations can “walk the talk” of maritime decarbonisation.

These are just some of the many WASP innovations I learned about during my Churchill Fellowship.

So, what can Australia do?

Australia privatised its national shipping line, Australian National Line, in the late 1990s, and is now serviced largely by overseas shipping companies which operate on global routes. Not much we can influence there. But there is plenty we can do in our own region and at the IMO:

– If Australia is selected to host COP31, it will be the “Pacific COP” with a focus on Pacific priorities, especially on climate vulnerability, adaptation, finance, ocean/climate justice, loss-and-damage, and resilience. Wind-powered Pacific ships can help make COP31 into an “action COP”, not just an “agreement COP:”

We could help raise multilateral funding for new Pacific wind-powered cargo ships, ideally alongside France and Germany, who have WASP technologies ready to deploy and existing Pacific interests and decarbonisation programs.

We could help bring the Juren Ae to Adelaide for COP31, and potentially also one of the new TOWT vessels currently under construction in Vietnam, to show delegates first hand how their funding could deliver quick and meaningful results in the Pacific.

We can deliver training. Pacific nations could benefit greatly from more maritime and vocational training from Australian providers including the Australian Maritime College and TAFE Queensland. The latter already delivers training for crews of the patrol boats donated by Australia through the Pacific Maritime Security Program, which is a great foundation to expand from.

– We could nurture the local innovators who are developing WASP technologies including GoSailCargo and Advanced Wing Systems and companies developing other maritime decarbonisation technologies including E Class Outboards.

– We should remain resolute supporters of the Net-Zero Framework at the IMO, to hold firm against the petrostates and to complement the national decarbonisation policies which will help Australia achieve its 2035 NDC target of 62-70%.

Wind-assisted shipping is one of the few mature, immediately deployable tools to meet the IMO’s new Net-Zero Framework. In contrast to alternative fuels, wind energy is available everywhere, is available today, is available at the point of use (so no costly and complex e-fuel supply chains are needed) and with zero fuel cost.

And best of all: the cost and energy savings from deploying WASP system on large ships will help us to afford the more expensive solutions that we’ll inevitably need to decarbonise deeper.

“Sometimes the best discoveries are rediscoveries. We have a green, efficient, cost-effective solution ready to help the industry meet its goals now. We have to realise that there’s no need to reinvent the wheel. We can look back to go forwards, rediscovering the huge potential of wind. Let’s keep it simple.

The deadline for concrete proposals for such a regulation to be submitted to the thirteenth session of the IMO’s technical committee that addresses pollution prevention and response (PPR13, February 2026) is December 5.

“Ahead of a crucial meeting of the IMO next February, the Clean Arctic Alliance is calling for the Member States of the International Maritime Organization to develop and adopt a mandatory regulation which would require that only polar fuels can be used by shipping in the Arctic,” said Dr Sian Prior, lead advisor to the Clean Arctic Alliance.

“A resolution on polar fuels adopted by Nordic governments next week would send a strong message to IMO Member States that action is urgently needed to protect the Arctic from the impacts of shipping emissions.

“Black carbon is a climate super pollutant produced when fossil fuels are burned.

“Black carbon has a disproportionate impact because it both heats the atmosphere – and when released from ship exhausts and when near to the Arctic it settles onto snow and ice, speeding up the melting and exposing darker land and sea beneath, which continue to absorb more heat. It is the loss of the planet’s reflectivity – or albedo – which is contributing to the fast pace of warming seen in the Arctic.

WinGD, a global leader in marine propulsion, is advancing the decarbonisation of shipping through innovative energy systems, cutting-edge emissions reduction technologies, and digital optimisation. The company is redefining the way the marine industry approaches sustainability, combining advanced two-stroke low-speed engines with comprehensive lifecycle support through Global Service by WinGD. ChemAnalyst spoke with Sebastian Hensel, Vice President of Research & Development at WinGD, about his professional journey, the technical and commercial case for ethanol-fuelled engines, and WinGD’s broader commitment to enabling a sustainable future for global shipping.

Complete Interview with Sebastian Hensel

Q: Please provide an overview of your professional journey and R&D leadership experience in marine propulsion and alternative fuels, and how these experiences have shaped your vision and approach at WinGD in pioneering ethanol-fuelled two-stroke engines.

Sebastian Hensel: As Vice President of Research & Development at WinGD, I lead our global innovation strategy, which today is deeply focused on enabling the clean-energy transition in shipping. My journey with WinGD began over 16 years ago as a combustion and computational fluid dynamics expert. Over the years, I’ve held various roles—leading Collaborative Research and Engine Performance and eventually Global Testing — before stepping into my current position.

Taking a moment to reflect on our decarbonisation journey, I’m truly proud of how far we’ve come. The urgency of the energy transition has placed engine technology front and centre, driving us to work at an extraordinary pace, one that’s both exhilarating and deeply motivating. But when we look at the innovation we’ve brought to market in these past years; it is truly remarkable. I am inspired by what we have been able to overcome through commitment, drive and collaborations with our customers and partners. And I am proud of the legacy this will leave for the future generations who are depending on us.

Q: The new ethanol engine is adapted from the X-DF-M methanol engine. Could you explain the key technical modifications made to accommodate ethanol’s higher energy density and different combustion characteristics?

Sebastian Hensel : Adapting the X-DF-M engine for ethanol is related to the different lower heating value, or energy density. This means that we need around 25% less fuel volume to generate the same power when using ethanol. To accommodate that, we need different fuel injection and engine control parameters and a fuel optimized nozzle design.

Because ethanol combustion involves different fuel-air mixtures and flame temperatures, there is also a slight impact on NOx formation. These emissions are tightly regulated by the International Maritime Organization (IMO), and we manage those with the new injection atomizer design and changes to the control system.

Beyond managing the injected fuel amount and optimizing some combustion relevant parameters, there will be few, if any, changes to the wider storage and fuel supply system. Material compatibilities are similar, for example, and under the IMO’s IGF and IGC Codes (for gas-fuelled and gas carrying ships respectively), the same vessel and machinery safety rules apply for both alcohol fuels.

Q: How has WinGD’s 10 years of research on ethanol and methanol helped shape the design, performance, and reliability of this new ethanol-fuelled engine?

Sebastian Hensel: Our early exploration into ethanol 10 years ago proved that it was a viable fuel for large two-stroke marine engines. Our deep understanding of its combustion characteristics, thermal efficiency and emissions profile, allowed us to design the injection and ignition concepts to optimize performance. Strong early market interest in methanol led us to bring that concept to market first, which has proven to be very favourable with our customers. Given the close similarity between methanol and ethanol, only minimal adaptation of the engine technology is required.

Q: Beyond ship owners, which stakeholders—such as fuel suppliers, classification societies, or regulators—have been critical in the development and commercialization of ethanol-fuelled engines, and how is WinGD engaging with them?

Sebastian Hensel: Collaboration is the key to accelerating the energy transition in shipping, so joining the Global Ethanol Association (GEA) as a founding member was a clear decision. We expect that it will become an important forum for sharing best practices as well as identifying opportunities to develop commercial and regulatory acceptance of ethanol as a marine fuel. By working with GEA, we are helping the shipping industry meet its decarbonization targets with solutions that combine flexibility, reliability, and sustainability.

Engagement with classification societies and regulators on ethanol is progressing. To meet our customers’ needs for flexibility, we are advancing both a pure ethanol engine concept and a dual-fuel solution. Based on current discussions, we anticipate smooth classification approval and see no regulatory barriers to ethanol adoption as a viable marine fuel.

In terms of safety, the viability of ethanol is already accounted for in IMO regulations. IMO’s Maritime Safety Committee Circular MSC.1/Circ.1621 contains Interim Guidelines for the Safety of Ships Using Methyl/Ethyl Alcohol as Fuel, which is valid for both methanol and ethanol as fuel. That means the same safety regulations govern the use of both fuels.

Further engagement with regulators will be essential, as lifecycle analysis guidelines are finalised, ensuring that ethanol’s emissions-saving advantages of ethanol are correctly accounted for.

Q: Can you outline the main technical and operational challenges your team faced in scaling ethanol engine technology, and how WinGD’s R&D approach overcame these hurdles?

Sebastian Hensel : Having first tested ethanol and later developed methanol technology, we’ve been able to adapt for ethanol use with straightforward, manageable technical adjustments.

We are now driving operational execution to meet market demand and deliver parallel technology rollouts. Backed by advanced resource planning and WinGD’s industry-leading testing infrastructure, we are fully equipped to deliver results with speed and precision.

Q: From a market perspective, how do you see global adoption of ethanol-fuelled marine engines evolving, and which regions or types of shipping are likely to lead in uptake?

Sebastian Hensel: There are specific countries where ethanol’s price and availability will make it an attractive option, for example in Brazil, US, Canada and India. Ethanol is already widely available and produced at significant scale in these markets. It is also competitively priced. That is in part due to lower-than-expected demand from road transport due to the emergence of electric vehicles. In some cases, ethanol is cheaper even than diesel, which makes it unique amongst biofuels.

As with other alternative fuels, it is difficult to predict how global availability will evolve, as this will be driven by future demand from sectors including shipping. So, it will likely be operators serving those markets where ethanol is widely available that will adopt it as fuel. In Brazil for example, where there are significant oil, iron ore and soybean exports as well as ready availability of ethanol, it is foreseeable that bulk carriers and tankers serving that market will consider using the fuel.

Our ethanol concept can in principle use methanol as well, with optimisation for either fuel. We therefore expect that ship owners already using methanol—for example container lines—will be exploring the opportunity to use ethanol if it is available and competitive on the routes they trade. And as is often the case with new fuels, vessels already carrying ethanol will have an added incentive to use their cargo as fuel and are likely to be among early adopters.

Q: With sustainability regulations tightening worldwide, how is WinGD leveraging R&D to ensure ethanol engines not only meet current emission standards but also anticipate future regulatory requirements?

Sebastian Hensel: In terms of lifecycle analysis, which will be crucial for determining penalties and rewards under various regulatory regimes, the full well-to-wake emissions for ethanol depend on the feedstock, production process and supply chain (well-to-tank) as well as emissions arising directly from use (tank-to-wake). There are a wide range of ethanol feedstocks and production processes, and an increasing focus by producers on delivering low-emissions ethanol.

According to the Climate Ethanol Association: “Sugarcane ethanol produced at an average facility in Brazil might show GHG savings of approximately 60% compared to fossil fuels under conservative assumptions, while more optimized facilities can achieve reductions approaching 90%. When the same lifecycle analysis methodologies and models are used, US corn ethanol offers similar GHG savings in the 50-70% range. These figures are consistent with existing data across methodologies in Europe, North America, and other regions.

“Further reductions are anticipated through the deployment of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies. As these advancements are adopted more broadly, it is plausible that average GHG savings could approach—or even exceed—100% relative to baseline fossil fuel emissions under commonly accepted calculation methodologies.”

Those figures suggest that ethanol could play a role in enabling ship operators to meet IMO’s target of net-zero emissions from global shipping by or around 2050. Our role is to design engines that use as little fuel as they can to fulfil the power demand, minimise combustion-related emissions, and work safely and reliably.

Q: Innovation is central to WinGD’s dual-fuel programs. How do you foster a culture of research, experimentation, and continuous improvement within your R&D teams to accelerate alternative fuel solutions?

Sebastian Hensel: In this regard, we are lucky – our core purpose, which is to power the clean-energy transformation in shipping is truly motivating and it requires a high degree of innovation.

Our innovation centre has been the core and backbone of WinGD technology for over 125 years. The teams today carry on our legacy of innovation by driving change in our industry at an exceptional pace. We are especially proud of our recent advancements in zero-near-zero fuel technology and product development which is a credit to the whole team.

We share a passion and fascination for technology, and a genuine curiosity for how our products can improve the lives of our customers and the generations to come. Our processes enhance idea generation and creativity in the early stage of the development, while our commitment to operational excellence ensures safe and timely delivery at completion. Within the R&D environment we have young talents and senior experts engaged and empowered together, across our global locations. Our learnings are experienced together, and our achievements and extraordinary efforts are recognized and celebrated.

Q: Looking ahead, what do you see as the most transformative opportunities for ethanol and other alcohol fuels in the marine sector, and where is WinGD focusing its R&D efforts over the next 5–10 years?

Sebastian Hensel: WinGD envisions a multi-fuel landscape for maritime for several decades at least, with ship operators making fuel decisions based on availability and pricing for their specific areas of operation. Methanol and ethanol will have a role to play, and the scaling of lower emission variants will drive their use further.

Our mission is to ensure that ship operators can choose which fuel works for them, and the new ethanol engine is an example of how we aim to respond to emerging market demand. We offer safe, reliable, and efficient engine concepts for diesel, LNG, methanol, ammonia, LPG, and ethanol.

ChemAnalyst Insights on Ethanol

In Europe, ethanol market activity in Germany during the second quarter of 2025 reflected a balance between soft demand and supply-side constraints. Prices eased slightly as weak consumption and logistical challenges, particularly rail and port disruptions around Hamburg and Bremerhaven, weighed on trade flows. Early in the quarter, subdued blending demand linked to cooler weather and lower gasoline use kept the market under pressure, though stability returned in May as port congestion limited availability. By late June, regulatory compliance needs supported a mild recovery in blending activity. Production costs remained elevated throughout the period due to high agricultural input expenses and energy-related inflation, though some relief was seen toward the end of the quarter. Imports from the Americas and intra-EU shipments helped offset domestic bottlenecks, yet market sentiment stayed cautious amid concerns over trade route irregularities. Looking ahead, stricter greenhouse gas reduction mandates and reduced certificate allowances are expected to strengthen ethanol blending demand in the coming months, adding upward pressure on prices as logistical constraints persist.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-10-24 05:16:57.716535

From the supply and demand perspective, DNV statistics as of August 2025 indicate that the demands for biodiesel, LNG, and green methanol are approximately 200 million/40 million/6 million tons respectively, whereas marine fuel supplies are only at 700,000/100,000/100,000 tons, highlighting a severe shortage of low-carbon fuels. Economically, compliance costs in the EU exceed those under the IMO framework and are increasing annually. The total fuel plus compliance costs for 2025/2030/2040/2050 are projected to be $741/$953/$1,649/$3,014 per ton (under the IMO framework, VLSFO plus compliance costs for 2028/2030/2040 will be $525/$583/$1,362 per ton), driving the increased demand for low-carbon fuels.

The main points from Sinolink Securities are as follows:

Frequent shipping decarbonization policies from the IMO and the EU are being implemented, marking the beginning of the practical phase for shipping decarbonization.

Global marine fuel consumption is approximately 300 million tons, corresponding to over 1 billion tons of carbon emissions (with the EU accounting for about 18%), representing 3% of global emissions. Decarbonization policies for shipping continue to emerge from the EU and IMO. 1) EU: The shipping industry will be included in the EU Emissions Trading System starting in 2024, with non-compliance gaps subject to fines of €100 per ton of CO2e. FuelEU mandates a 2% reduction in carbon emissions starting in 2025, reaching an 80% reduction by 2050, with violators fined €642 per ton of CO2e. 2) IMO: In 2023, a net-zero strategy for 2050 was proposed, and in April 2025, a draft framework for net-zero emissions was approved, establishing a unified carbon price ($380 or $100 per ton of CO2e) to significantly advance shipping decarbonization. 3) China: Green fuel pilot programs are underway, and it has been clarified that the consumption of green hydrogen, ammonia, and methanol can be counted towards green power consumption targets.

The target usage rate for ZNZ by 2030 is 5-10%. Rising compliance costs are contributing to increased demand for ZNZ, leading to a situation of undersupply in the industry.

From the supply and demand perspective, DNV statistics as of August 2025 indicate that the demands for biodiesel, LNG, and green methanol are approximately 200 million/40 million/6 million tons respectively, whereas marine fuel supplies are only at 700,000/100,000/100,000 tons, highlighting a severe shortage of low-carbon fuels.

The total fuel plus compliance costs for 2025/2030/2040/2050 are projected to be $741/$953/$1,649/$3,014 per ton (under the IMO framework, VLSFO plus compliance costs for 2028/2030/2040 will be $525/$583/$1,362 per ton), driving the increased demand for low-carbon fuels. It should be noted that carbon pricing locks in the upper limit for ZNZ, with current green methanol prices at $6,200 per ton dependent on a carbon price of $380 per ton. Future efforts must focus on cost reduction. By comparison, biodiesel is more economical than green methanol (at 0.21/0.31 yuan per MJ respectively).

Biodiesel: A core decarbonization measure for existing vessels, with high growth in port bunkering volumes.

Demand: Existing vessels primarily rely on single traditional fuels, with extremely high retrofitting costs, making future decarbonization heavily reliant on biodiesel. There has been significant growth in biodiesel bunkering volumes at Singapore ports. Since 2022, biodiesel bunkering volumes at Singapore ports have continued to rise sharply, reflecting that demand is gradually materializing. On the supply side, global biodiesel production is approximately 52 million tons, mainly used for reducing carbon emissions from diesel vehicles. With the rapid development of electric vehicles, biodiesel is expected to shift more towards sectors that are difficult to electrify, such as shipping. Investors are advised to monitor companies like Excellence New Energy (688196.SH) and Shandong Hi-Speed Environmental Energy (000803.SZ).

Biogas: Broad demand for LNG carriers, green premium to drive explosive growth

Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) can significantly reduce carbon emissions, improve the environment, and enhance energy security. China and the EU aim to achieve production targets exceeding 20 billion/35 billion cubic meters by 2030. Historically, RNG development has been slow mainly due to high costs. However, with the implementation of the IMO's net-zero framework and the mass balance model, there is potential for the realization of RNG's green premium (with a green premium as high as 725% for US-based Archaea RNG). The industry is poised for rapid growth. Recommended companies to watch include Viridi Clean Energy (300190.SZ) and China Tianying (000035.SZ).

Green Methanol: Rapid growth in methanol ships expected to result in robust supply and demand in the medium term

The current fleet of 406 methanol vessels (including orders) is projected to generate demand for methanol exceeding 8 million tons. However, global green methanol capacity expected to be operational by the end of 2025 totals only 1.24 million tons, with 730,000 tons in China, indicating a short-term supply shortage. Although global mid-term plans exceed 40 million tons, considering the various challenges in actual implementation (certification, resources, technology, costs, etc.), companies that can quickly implement projects and possess cost and scale advantages are likely to benefit first. Recommended companies to watch include: FJ Eco-Environmental Protection (688335.SH), China Tianying (000035.SZ), Goldwind Technologies (002202.SZ), Jilin Electric Power Co., Ltd. (000875.SZ), Foshan Gas Energy (002911.SZ), Hong Kong and China Gas Company Limited (00003.HK), CIMC Enric Holdings (03899.HK), COSCO SHIPPING International (00517.HK), among others.

What new technologies or digital platforms do you see redefining sea freight operations in the next five years?

Artificial Intelligence is set to transform sea freight operations over the next three to five years. While documentation and administrative tasks currently require significant time, AI will increasingly automate these processes, reduce errors and improve efficiency. Beyond documentation, AI will enable predictive arrivals, demand forecasting, route optimization, and risk management, making operations faster, more reliable, and resilient.

At the same time, Internet of Things (IoT) technologies will provide real-time visibility into container locations, temperature, humidity, and cargo conditions, enhancing supply chain transparency and safety. Automation in port operations and autonomous navigation technologies will streamline loading, unloading, and vessel movement, while green shipping solutions, including alternative fuels, wind-assisted propulsion, and energy-efficient vessels, will reduce environmental impact.

Together, these innovations will enable smarter, agile, and sustainable sea freight solutions, helping global supply chains adapt to evolving trade patterns and customer expectations.

The International Maritime Organization’s recent failure to adopt a global carbon-pricing mechanism for shipping is more than another bureaucratic delay. It is a demonstration of Garrett Hardin’s “tragedy of the commons” in real time, replayed on the high seas. The ocean is the world’s pasture and the atmosphere is the waste pit for its exhaust. Each nation benefits from cheap trade and fossil fuels, while the long-term costs are spread thin across the entire planet. What should have been a landmark step toward collective stewardship turned into another lesson in how ideology shapes, and often defeats, cooperation.

Last week’s meeting of the International Maritime Organization ended without agreement on a proposed global carbon-pricing mechanism for the shipping industry. The plan, part of the organization’s Net-Zero Framework, aimed to put a price on emissions and use the revenue to support cleaner fuels and infrastructure. The proposal collapsed after heavy lobbying by the United States, which reportedly warned smaller member states of trade and diplomatic consequences if they supported the measure. Saudi Arabia and a handful of allies backed the U.S. position, framing the levy as a threat to competitiveness. The outcome was a one-year postponement and another missed opportunity to align the maritime sector with global climate goals.

Hardin’s 1968 parable was simple. A group of herders share a pasture. Each gains individually by adding more animals, even though overgrazing will destroy the grass. Since the cost of overuse is shared, the incentive to restrain is weak. The result is collapse of the common resource. The essay was a warning about incentives, not morality, yet over time it has become a mirror. Every ideology that reads it sees a different villain and a different cure.

Classical economists treat the tragedy as a pricing failure. If the pasture is free, it will be overused. Their solution is to internalize the externality through taxes, permits, or private ownership. In their view, the IMO’s proposed carbon levy was a clean correction: make each ton of carbon emitted by a ship carry a cost, and the industry will innovate toward efficiency. The European Union and Japan largely followed this logic, supporting a price on emissions as the most rational way to align markets with climate stability.

Neoliberal thinkers take a similar but narrower view. They agree that markets should solve the problem, but distrust regulation to do it. Their instinct is to commodify the commons rather than govern it. At the IMO, this view was embodied by the United States, which opposed the carbon-pricing framework on the grounds that it was a “global tax on trade.” American negotiators and allied industry groups insisted that innovation would clean up shipping without what they called coercive rules. In practice, that argument protects incumbents. When the world’s largest economy rejects a collective price on emissions, the invisible hand becomes a barrier to cooperation.

Liberals and social democrats interpret the commons as a shared trust that must be managed through transparent rules and mutual obligation. For them, the proposed levy was not an economic scheme but an act of stewardship. The idea was to recycle the revenue into clean fuel infrastructure in developing nations and into adaptation funding for small island states that are already facing the physical consequences of climate change. To these delegations, mainly from Europe and the Pacific, the United States’ behavior was not a philosophical disagreement but a direct betrayal of multilateralism. Reports surfaced that senior American politicians lobbied IMO member states to block the measure even while Congress was shut down. The pattern was unmistakable.

Libertarians saw something different in the same pasture. To them, the tragedy of the commons is not a call for cooperation but proof that ownership is the only safeguard. Each actor should be free to decide how to manage its own resources. The IMO proposal, from this perspective, was an assault on sovereignty. The American fossil fuel lobby and many right-wing commentators framed it as a form of global governance, a loss of freedom disguised as environmental policy. The rhetoric of individual liberty served as cover for collective neglect.

Socialists reversed the libertarian logic. They saw the IMO stalemate as another example of capitalist capture of a shared resource. The atmosphere and oceans are global goods, but the profits from their exploitation flow to a small number of corporations and petro-states. For many in the Global South, the carbon levy was less about pricing efficiency than fairness. Those who had benefited most from burning fossil fuels should shoulder more of the cost of cleaning up. From this view, the United States and Saudi Arabia were defending entrenched interests while vulnerable nations were left to absorb the damage.

Environmentalists read Hardin as a moral text. They see the pasture as the planet itself, not a metaphor. To them, every year of delay at the IMO is measurable harm: more CO2, more ocean acidification, more rising water. Shipping accounts for roughly 3% of global greenhouse emissions, a share comparable to major industrial nations. The science is not in dispute. The failure to act is a political choice that sacrifices the long term for the short term. Environmental advocates saw the U.S. position as deliberate obstruction, not strategic caution.

Technocrats focus on systems management rather than ideology. They believe better monitoring, reporting, and optimization can prevent collapse. Inside the IMO, this tendency shows up in endless debates about metrics, efficiency standards, and pilot programs. Japan and South Korea lean heavily on this approach, preferring incremental improvements over broad policy commitments. The U.S. government often supports this middle ground because it sounds reasonable and buys time. The result is motion without direction.

Nationalists draw the boundaries of the commons around their own borders. The U.S. and Saudi Arabia both invoked national interest to justify resistance. Saudi officials feared that a carbon price would undercut oil revenues, while American leaders claimed it would raise shipping costs for U.S. exports. In both cases, sovereignty was the language of self-interest. Protecting the homeland became synonymous with preserving fossil competitiveness.

Corporate strategists, meanwhile, read Hardin as a business opportunity. For some firms, regulation is an advantage. Maersk and a few other global carriers had already invested in green methanol ships and supported the carbon levy because it would level the field. For others, especially fuel suppliers and smaller operators, delay was profitable. Every year without a carbon price keeps older fleets viable and fossil fuels cheap. The commons becomes a market to game rather than a system to preserve.

Communitarian and Indigenous perspectives reject the framing of the commons as property at all. For small island nations such as Tuvalu and Vanuatu, the ocean is home, not a pasture. Their push for a carbon levy was grounded in reciprocity: those who profit from maritime trade should help protect the seas that make it possible. Watching the most powerful country on earth block even modest reform was a reminder of how fragile moral appeals become in the face of power.

Sociopath’s are not ignorant herders in the commons, but understand the consequences and choose to graze two sheep anyway. They know the pasture will fail but calculate that they will profit before it does. This mindset is difficult to distinguish from the libertarian argument for absolute freedom, which elevates individual choice above collective restraint. Both claim that responsibility is personal and that limits are a kind of tyranny. The difference is intent: the sociopath acts with awareness and indifference, while at least some libertarians rationalize that the damage will somehow be self-correcting. In the current U.S. position at the IMO, the two have merged. The refusal to price carbon is presented as defense of liberty and competitiveness, but it functions as deliberate overgrazing of the planet’s shared field, a knowing decision to take short-term advantage while others bear the cost of decline.

The American position at the IMO cannot be separated from the Trump-era narrative that climate change is a “green scam.” That phrase, repeated by senior figures and amplified through media networks, has moved from the fringes into policy. It casts every environmental measure as a conspiracy to tax the public and weaken the nation. The claim is politically effective because it transforms collective restraint into betrayal. In that framework, science becomes suspect, and cooperation becomes surrender. The same framing shaped the lobbying campaign that derailed the IMO’s carbon-pricing plan.

This episode reveals more than policy disagreement. It shows how ideology determines action when a commons is under strain. The EU approached the problem as a market correction. The Pacific nations treated it as survival. Saudi Arabia saw a threat to its oil rents. The U.S. viewed it through a lens of nationalism and fossil patronage. Every actor was rational within its own worldview, and that is the heart of Hardin’s insight. The tragedy of the commons is not only that people pursue self-interest, but that they define self-interest differently and cannot agree on the rules.

The cost of delay is concrete. Ships have lifespans of 20 to 30 years. Every new vessel built without zero-carbon capability will still be burning fossil fuels in the 2050s. Carbon pricing would have accelerated investment in cleaner fuels and propulsion. Its absence locks in emissions and puts greater pressure on land-based sectors to make up the gap. The longer the IMO remains divided, the more likely regional systems such as the EU Emissions Trading Scheme will dominate. Fragmented regulation raises costs and weakens global coordination.

The lesson is not that global governance is impossible, but that it cannot succeed without shared definition of fairness. The tragedy of the maritime commons is preventable, but only if the largest players treat stewardship as a duty rather than a concession. Markets can manage scarcity, but they cannot manage morality. The United States once led the creation of institutions designed to prevent exactly this kind of collective failure. Its choice to obstruct rather than lead shows how far it has drifted from that role.

The oceans remain open, the ships continue to sail, and the carbon continues to rise. Hardin’s pasture is the planet. Whether it endures will depend not on our technology, but on our willingness to see the commons not as a burden to avoid, but as the foundation of shared prosperity.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ChatGPT-Image-Oct-23-2025-07_10_52-PM-800x445.png,N,,2025-10-24 05:17:08.684784

Industry Warns Delay Could Slow Maritime Low-Carbon Transition.

LNG Gains Competitiveness as Green Fuel Investment Faces Uncertainty.

Fossil fuels might still be the go-to energy source for shipping, especially since the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) is facing delays with its new decarbonization rules, as noted by industry insiders. Advocates of the Net-Zero Framework (NZF) were counting on these regulations to speed up the transition from oil-based fuels to greener options like methanol and ammonia, reports S&P Global.

Framework Adoption Postponed

Just earlier this month, member states of the IMO decided to push back the adoption of the NZF by a year, which means we might not see it implemented until the end of this decade—or even longer. Thomas Blomgren-Hansen, Chief Advisor at the Danish Maritime Authority, said: “The delay will in reality lead to a reopening of text because a revision of dates is required.” “That could lead a complete renegotiation, putting the whole deal at risk [and] delaying the transition for an even longer period.”

According to S&P Global Commodity Insights, oil-based fuels made up a whopping 97% of the global bunker mix in 2024, with LNG trailing at just 2%. The new IMO regulation aims to impose a cost on the greenhouse gas emissions from bunker fuels starting in 2028, which should help close the price gap between traditional and sustainable fuels.

Industry Reaction and Concerns

This delay has thrown a wrench into the plans of shipping and bunker companies that are trying to make a low-carbon shift, although some are optimistic that it gives them more time to refine the framework’s design. Jan Dieleman, Cargill’s shipping head, said: “After what happened… I can understand why people don’t want to double down on net-zero fuels.”

There’s been pushback against the framework from the US, Russia, Venezuela, and several Middle Eastern oil producers, who argue that it imposes hefty carbon costs and strict decarbonization rules. Saudi Arabia has suggested a postponement, with backing from China, India, and key flag states like Panama and Liberia. Even with an EU mandate to adopt the regulation, Greece and Cyprus abstained from the postponement vote. Greece’s Minister of Shipping, Vassilis Kikilias, said the framework has “unfair treatment of LNG fuel” and would likely cause serious disruptions in global trade and lead to inflation.

Regulatory and Implementation Outlook

IMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez emphasised: “The framework is in place, what we need to do is to develop the guideline. What we paused is the adoption itself, not further work.” DNV estimates LNG could become a non-compliant fuel by the end of this decade, though member states could extend its use with a low default emissions factor.

Lars Jensen, CEO of Vespucci Maritime, noted: “LNG just got another improvement in its relative competitiveness versus the fully green fuels,” citing increased uncertainty over the investment case for green fuel production due to the framework’s delay.

LNG as a Transitional Fuel

LNG can reduce emissions by 20%-30% compared with oil-based fuels. Supporters argue LNG-capable ships can later switch to bio-LNG or e-LNG for deep decarbonization.

SEA-LNG, an industry association promoting marine LNG, stated: “The methane pathway is currently the only practical, realistic and scalable solution to the decarbonization of the global maritime industry.”

The association plans to continue scientific studies to support the IMO’s work. Rystad Energy estimates the well-to-tank GHG intensity of LNG bunker fell from 18.8 g CO2e/MJ in 2019 to 13.9 g CO2e/MJ in 2024.

Geopolitics Overshadowing Regulation

Some industry participants warn that the adoption of the IMO regulation may depend more on geopolitical factors than content.

Maria Skipper Schwenn, Director of Public Affairs at Bunker Holding, said: “The world we’re living in today is very different from the one just a few years ago. I think it would be fair to say that the opponents’ reasoning had very little to do with shipping.” The combination of regulatory delays, political opposition, and high fossil fuel reliance continues to cloud the outlook for a low-carbon maritime transition.

“Using the average recycling pattern during 2000-2019, we estimate that the current minimum recycling overhang is 500 ships and 1.8 million TEU,” says Niels Rasmussen, Chief Shipping Analyst at BIMCO.
Rasmussen highlights that this results in a maximum overhang estimate of 850 ships and 3.1 million TEU.
The data highlights that the share of older ships has not been higher since the early 1970s.
“However, our estimates indicate an overhang of 6-10 percent of currently trading ships, equal to 33-55 percent of ships older than 20 years.","The shipping industry has speculated for years that a potential recycling wave might be coming, but it was delayed by low capacity, high demand, and issues ranging from the pandemic-related shipping surge to the diversions away from the Red Sea. Industry trade group BIMCO highlights that many older ships have been hanging on longer than anticipated, creating a large market overhang ripe for recycling.

“Using the average recycling pattern during 2000-2019, we estimate that the current minimum recycling overhang is 500 ships and 1.8 million TEU,” says Niels Rasmussen, Chief Shipping Analyst at BIMCO.

The numbers could be even more dramatic, BIMCO says, if you use the data from the earlier recycling of ships during the weaker market conditions of the 2010s to estimate the current maximum recycling overhang. Rasmussen highlights that this results in a maximum overhang estimate of 850 ships and 3.1 million TEU.

The share of ships 20 years old or older has increased from 16 percent at the beginning of 2020 to 24 percent currently, BIMCO reports. These ships were used to fill gaps in capacity over the past few years, and they are likely to make up the bulk of future recycling. The data highlights that the share of older ships has not been higher since the early 1970s.

“So far this year, only 10 container ships have been recycled,” says Rasmussen. “This extends a pattern of low recycling activity seen since 2021, as many ships have continued trading beyond their usual recycling age. Applying historical recycling patterns, we have calculated an average lifecycle for each size segment of the fleet and compared it to the current fleet. For instance, during the period from 2000 to 2019, 20 percent of ships were recycled before the age of 20, and 53 percent of ships were recycled before turning 25 years old.

There are a few other factors that could influence the speed at which ships are sent for recycling. BIMCO highlights the currently very large orderbook, the threat of ship demand erosion if ships return to normal Suez Canal routings, and regulatory requirements to improve ship efficiency. All of this could contribute to the higher end of its estimate.

“Future recycling is very difficult to estimate accurately,” says Rasmussen. “However, our estimates indicate an overhang of 6-10 percent of currently trading ships, equal to 33-55 percent of ships older than 20 years.

He notes that the estimated overhang is larger than the orderbook for all ship segments, but that is especially so for the small, under 8,000 TEU, vessels. He says this points to a trend where fleet growth in the coming years will be driven exclusively by the larger ships, which in turn could drive further cascading of larger ships into routes where smaller ships are currently deployed.",https://maritime-executive.com/media/images/article/Photos/Wreckage_Salvage/ship-recycler-s-association-of-turkey.1bb908.jpg,N,,2025-10-23 19:16:28.252509

The NZF also set goals to cut annual carbon emissions from international shipping by at least 20% by 2030, and 70% by 2040, and then finally reach net-zero emissions by 2050.

""We were disappointed that this did not go through,"" said Marco Romero, a decarbonization specialist with risk management firm DNV, speaking at 2025's One Ocean Week conference in Seattle, Washington, on October 21. ""We were looking for something that would harmonize the global approach.""

In April, the United Nations member states approved the initial draft of the IMO's policy Net-Zero Framework (NZF), which would mean imposing a global shipping emissions tax from 2028 in order to fund cleaner maritime technologies and help developing nations transition to low-carbon shipping. The NZF also set goals to cut annual carbon emissions from international shipping by at least 20% by 2030, and 70% by 2040, and then finally reach net-zero emissions by 2050.

But, on October 17, all members of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) voted to postpone a vote on passing the NZF until late 2026. The pullback came a day after President Donald Trump criticized the plan as a ""global green scam tax on shipping,"" and threatened to impose port levies and sanctions against any nations that supported it.

Although pressure from the U.S. is significant, the controversy surrounding the Net-Zero Framework extends well beyond Trump's objections, delegates at the conference said.

""There is a coalition of groups that had concerns — some of them very valid, and some of them very rooted in practicality,"" said Romero.

Some groups were critical of the framework for its inclusion of biofuels as a low-carbon alternative to fossil fuels, pointing to how the production of biofuels still releases carbon through deforestation and intensive farming practices. Others claimed that the NZF wasn't ambitious enough to meet any of the emissions benchmarks it had set along the path to net-zero.

In any case, delaying the NZF could end up being a double-edged sword, Romero said. On one hand, it provides an opportunity for the industry to reconvene and address any outstanding concerns. On the other hand, the NZF will still have the same emissions benchmarks to hit, regardless of the delay. ""What we lost is the mechanism to get there,"" Romero explained.

As deliberations over the framework continue in 2026, Romero stressed the need for individual stakeholders, countries and regions to continue taking steps to develop cleaner fuels and reduce emissions themselves. Ultimately, that collective effort will be critical in bridging the gap created by the IMO's delay.

The study highlighted a substantial gap between projected clean fuel supply and targeted demand, worsened by infrastructure limitations, raising doubts about the feasibility of the proposed transition timeline.

It also identified ongoing imbalances in the carbon trading mechanism, forecasting that demand for Tier II offset units will exceed available surplus units until 2035 — a structural deficit likely to push trading prices toward the Tier II penalty ceiling.

The report stressed the need for careful design of the reward mechanism to avoid turning it into a mere fine collection system. While cost gaps are expected to narrow as technology matures and economies of scale improve, an effective incentive structure remains essential to encourage sustainable practices. By addressing these key issues, the IMO can develop a more efficient and equitable framework to support a low-carbon future for the maritime sector.

Rystad Energy noted that decarbonizing shipping is a complex challenge that extends beyond the industry itself, being closely tied to the global shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy. The findings suggest that progress will likely be slower than IMO’s current projections due to infrastructure constraints, technological readiness, and the interconnected nature of energy systems.

While the industry has shown strong commitment, practical limitations call for a pragmatic approach. The IMO is expected to use the extra year to develop a more realistic and balanced framework.

Junlin Yu, Vice President of Supply Chain Research at Rystad Energy, said, “The IMO should use this additional year to craft a framework that is both practical and fair.”

The company recently published a detailed report on the financial structure of maritime decarbonization under the Net Zero Framework, available on its official website.

The analysis was based on an extensive database covering conventional fuels, hydrogen derivatives, and biofuels, alongside a global review of alternative-fuel fleets, port infrastructure, and shipyard capabilities.

Under the NZF, vessels that meet emissions targets generate Surplus Units (SUs), while non-compliant vessels generate Rectification Units (RUs), classified into:

Tier I (RU1s): for vessels meeting minimum targets.

Tier II (RU2s): for vessels failing to meet required targets.

Non-compliant vessels can offset Tier II rectification units by purchasing surplus units from compliant ones.

Rystad’s projections show a complex interaction between surplus and rectification units. Surplus units are expected to start at 40 million tonnes of CO₂ equivalent in 2028, rising to 53 million by 2035, while RU2s could soar from 47 million to 234 million tonnes annually by 2035.

This imbalance will dictate market pricing, with Rystad forecasting that RU2 demand will remain above available surplus supply until 2035 — likely pushing trading prices toward the Tier II penalty cap.

According to the company’s analysis, surplus unit prices will be driven more by market dynamics than by biofuel price differentials.

Given the limited supply of advanced biofuels for shipping, surplus unit prices are projected to approach the penalty ceiling of $380 per tonne of CO₂ equivalent after transaction costs.

Yu added, “While surplus units will offset much of the Tier II penalties until 2030, this may also limit financial incentives for early adopters of zero-emission technologies.”

A structural shift is expected in 2031, as surplus units decline and compliance requirements tighten, increasing emission deficits among shipping companies. This will result in higher penalty revenues, strengthening the NZF Fund’s ability to finance industry-wide decarbonization efforts.

The study also highlighted design challenges in the framework — notably the two-year holding limit on surplus units, intended to prevent dilution of future emission-reduction efforts. However, this restriction could discourage early adoption of clean technologies, unlike the EU’s FuelEU Maritime regulation, which allows permanent storage of units.

Financial forecasts show that the IMO’s Net Zero Fund could grow significantly, with Tier I and Tier II penalties expected to generate around $13 billion in 2028 and nearly $79 billion by 2035.

Still, the analysis questions whether the framework will effectively support the shift to zero-emission vessels, particularly in its initial stages.

Rystad estimates that the required reward levels to achieve cost parity between e-fuels and conventional fuels will initially be prohibitively high, leading to a financial shortfall until 2030 — even if the fund’s full resources are allocated to incentives.

Over time, however, technological advances and production scaling are expected to narrow this gap, ultimately producing a substantial fund surplus after 2030.

Bitcoin rose more than 2% over the past 24 hours, climbing back above $109,500 as traders positioned themselves ahead of Friday’s release of the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) — the week’s most closely watched economic event.

With most official economic data on hold due to the ongoing US government shutdown, investors expect the upcoming inflation report to be the only major indicator guiding markets this week.

Analysts at QCP Capital wrote in a Thursday report: “The only data point that really matters this week is Friday’s CPI, as it will be the sole reading the Federal Reserve sees before resuming its policy communications.”

The firm added that a softer-than-expected inflation reading could reinforce the “soft landing” narrative for the US economy and provide fresh momentum for Bitcoin prices.

“A 0.2% reading would support that narrative and keep Bitcoin’s upward trend intact,” the report said, noting that gold (GC=F) posted its biggest one-day drop since 2020 as the US dollar strengthened, while Bitcoin briefly spiked to $114,000 before pulling back.

Geopolitical Tensions Dominate, but Trade Talks Offer Hope

Despite persistent geopolitical tensions weighing on global risk appetite, reports of potential trade talks between Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump brought some relief to markets.

The two leaders are expected to meet on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in South Korea later this month, in a meeting investors hope could ease trade and security frictions in the region.

Diverging Views on Bitcoin’s Path

Bitcoin has declined since reaching a record high above $126,270 on October 6, 2025.

John Glover, Chief Investment Officer at Ledn, believes the rally is over.

“The Bitcoin bull run is done!” he told Yahoo Finance UK. “I think we’ve completed the five-wave advance and are now entering a bear market that could last through the end of 2026.”

Glover added that while a retest of $124,000 is possible, he expects prices to trade lower overall in the coming months.

“I’m looking for a major correction into the $70,000–$80,000 range — perhaps even lower — and the final target will become clearer as prices evolve over the next few months.”

Institutional Demand Could Fuel Renewed Optimism

On the other hand, Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer at Bitwise, said Bitcoin could see another leg higher if short-term selling pressure eases.

“If current sellers step back, allowing institutional demand to play a larger role, Bitcoin could mirror gold’s 2025 rally,” Hougan wrote in a research note this week.

He pointed out that gold has gained roughly 57% in 2025, driven by surging central bank purchases that have more than doubled since the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine war — from around 467 tons annually to 1,080 tons, according to Metals Focus.

Hougan said this level of buying nearly matches demand from gold exchange-traded products (ETPs), which helps explain why gold has outperformed Bitcoin this year.

“If central banks are the main engine behind gold’s rally, it’s only natural that Bitcoin hasn’t risen at the same pace,” he added.

Despite strong demand from spot Bitcoin ETFs and institutional investors, Hougan believes cautious sentiment continues to limit gains: “Bitcoin hasn’t yet reached $200,000 despite robust inflows, because price-sensitive investors keep selling into every 10%–15% rally.”

Oil prices surged by 5% on Thursday after the United States imposed new sanctions on Russian energy giants Rosneft and Lukoil over the war in Ukraine, extending the gains recorded in the previous session.

Brent crude futures rose by $3.39, or 5.4%, to $65.98 a barrel at 10:18 GMT, while US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) gained $3.31, or 5.7%, to $61.81 a barrel.

Ole Hansen, an analyst at Saxo Bank, said the US sanctions mean that refineries in China and India — the largest buyers of Russian oil — will now have to seek alternative suppliers to avoid being cut off from the Western banking system.

Washington reaffirmed its readiness to take further action, urging Moscow to agree immediately to a ceasefire in Ukraine. The UK had already imposed sanctions on Rosneft and Lukoil last week, while the European Union approved its nineteenth sanctions package against Russia, which included a ban on imports of Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG).

Market Structure Shift and US Inventory Drop

The Brent crude forward curve shifted into backwardation, with the front-month contract trading $1.98 above the six-month delivery contract, reflecting tightening short-term supplies.

Following the announcement of US sanctions, Brent and WTI futures both jumped more than $2 a barrel, also supported by an unexpected drawdown in US crude inventories.

Giovanni Staunovo, an analyst at UBS, said the impact of the sanctions on oil markets depends largely on India’s response and whether Russia can find new buyers for its crude.

India has become the largest importer of discounted Russian oil since the start of the war in Ukraine, but private refiners are expected to sharply reduce purchases under the new sanctions, according to industry sources.

Sources added that Reliance Industries, India’s biggest buyer of Russian crude, plans to significantly scale back — or even halt — its Russian oil imports in the coming period.

Lingering Doubts Despite the Rally

Some analysts remain skeptical that the new sanctions will bring about a lasting shift in the oil market. Claudio Galimberti, an analyst at Rystad Energy, said: “So far, most of the sanctions imposed on Russia for more than three and a half years have failed to meaningfully curb its oil production or revenues.”

He added that concerns over potential oversupply — due to increased output from the OPEC+ alliance — continue to cap price gains, while UBS expects Brent to remain within a $60–70 per barrel trading range.

On the demand side, data from the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) on Wednesday showed that US crude, gasoline, and distillate inventories declined last week amid improved refinery activity and stronger domestic consumption.",https://dixdeynibyck7.cloudfront.net/images/content/General/BUSINESSJOURNAL_01_L.jpg,N,,2025-10-23 17:17:00.576667

As the old English saying goes, “Every dark hour brings forth its champion.” In this case, nuclear power could be that champion.
Nuclear Power Generation represents a clean and virtually inexhaustible source of energy and much higher power generation capacities on board ships.
The use of nuclear technology will also herald the rise of a new category of service suppliers (e.g.
The first floating nuclear power plants—potential forerunners of nuclear-powered merchant ships—are expected to enter service within the next decade.","The shipping industry has resolved to reduce its GHG emissions. Ambitious targets have been set for GHG emission reduction with a view to achieving a net-zero carbon future by 2050. This transition represents nothing short of a maritime renaissance, driving a paradigm shift in how ships operate. A wide range of low- or zero-carbon fuels and technologies—biofuels, methanol, ammonia, hydrogen, onboard carbon capture, battery assistance, and wind-assisted propulsion—are being explored, with sustainability as the central theme.

However, concerns have been raised on the production, supply, availability, and costs of new fuels and technologies (not to forget safety!). For example, today’s renewable power generation capacity is far from sufficient to meet the needs of large-scale green fuel production. Scaling up production is also not a trivial task, as it will need sustained efforts by all nations in an era of fragile geopolitical alliances and growing trade protectionism. Replacing or retrofitting existing ships with ships using cleaner fuels will also need enormous efforts in shipbuilding as well as recycling the existing fleet. This raises the question: is the industry being too hard on itself—and what will it truly take?

As the old English saying goes, “Every dark hour brings forth its champion.” In this case, nuclear power could be that champion. The Secretary General of the International Atomic Energy Agency noted a few years ago that without nuclear energy, achieving global climate goals will be impossible. And why not? Nuclear propulsion is not new - naval ships and submarines have relied on it for decades, while Russian icebreakers in the Arctic continue to use nuclear reactors for onboard power. Nuclear Power Generation represents a clean and virtually inexhaustible source of energy and much higher power generation capacities on board ships. Alternatively, a nuclear reactor may be installed on a barge moored offshore, and this can supply power to remote communities, or for desalination to produce potable water, or even to supply clean electricity to produce green fuels. The possibilities are multiple.

However, public opinion towards nuclear remains cautious—unsurprisingly, given the legacy of Chernobyl and Fukushima. Nuclear Technology works, there is no doubt about that. It is the potential consequences that are overwhelming should this technology face setbacks. The World Nuclear Association reports that more than 14000 reactor years of accident-free service have been recorded in a marine environment. The safety record of nuclear technology provides optimism, but this underscores efforts by designers, manufacturers, and regulators to ensure that this technology is safely harnessed. Nuclear Technology also offers a unique proposition to the maritime industry in the sense that at the end of life, not just the ship but also reactor components, auxiliaries, and spent fuel will have to be safely recycled.

There has been a spurt in the growth of Generation IV nuclear technology, which is deemed to improve safety using passive measures. The inherently safe design is expected to reduce to a major extent the possibility of another Chernobyl and Fukushima.

The arrival of General IV nuclear technology is undoubtedly cannot be ignored and shipping will explore what it can derive from the use of such technology. From a classification society’s perspective, the approval of nuclear technology for civilian ships will present significant challenges. The marine environment is considerably more dynamic and hostile compared to the terrestrial application. Classification societies will also need to engage with multiple regulators—from the International Atomic Energy Agency to national nuclear bodies, as well as port and coastal state authorities. It is anticipated that Class will serve as a bridge between the maritime and nuclear disciplines to ensure the safety of the ship, persons, and environment.

The role of a systematic and holistic risk assessment is paramount, as well as a robust procedure to qualify the use of such “FOAK” (first of a kind) technology for onboard use, which is necessary (while ensuring that it is technology-agnostic). The importance of Material Technology needs no emphasis to ensure safe containment of radioactive fuel, as well as ensuring that appropriate materials are used to shield against the effects of harmful radiation in the event of loss of containment. The use of nuclear technology will also herald the rise of a new category of service suppliers (e.g. fuel removal, replenishment, nuclear equipment inspection, maintenance, etc.) for which Class will have to prepare (though it is anticipated that most (if not all) of these will be guided by regulations for terrestrial nuclear plants). Licensing of shipyards and recycling yards to handle nuclear-powered ships is also foreseen.

ISM and Cybersecurity audits are additional aspects which Class (acting as recognized organizations for flag administration) will be called upon to address, as also the decommissioning stage, keeping into account both safety and security (i.e. to ensure non-proliferation).

Time is short. The first floating nuclear power plants—potential forerunners of nuclear-powered merchant ships—are expected to enter service within the next decade.

Class Rules and Guidelines have to be ready for these. Personnel with knowledge of nuclear technology will also be essential in a Classification Society, for this, we have resolved to undertake an ambitious program to ensure our staff is ready for the future with nuclear.

These are uncharted waters, but the shipping industry has always proven capable of navigating safely. IRCLASS is gearing up to rise to this occasion. As Gene Kranz, lead flight director of Apollo 13, famously said, “Failure is not an option.”

But one year of delay does not erase shipping's ultimate goal — decarbonization by 2050, as stipulated under the pre-existing 2023 IMO Revised Strategy. To reach this, many potential pathways are under consideration, including harmful biofuels.

Recent concerns about sustainability and land use have encouraged governments and businesses to promote policies incentivizing so-called “waste” or “residue” feedstocks for biofuels, such as used cooking oil. The idea behind these policies is to ease pressure on natural ecosystems and agricultural land, and to create a more circular economy where products are reused rather than discarded. However, like the biofuels boom more broadly, there have been unintended consequences.

Biofuels are often praised for their supposed carbon savings. Since many are derived from plants, the logic goes that the carbon they sequester while growing offsets the carbon released when they burn. Yet this is the first and most important thing to understand about biofuels: When combusted, they still emit carbon dioxide.

That might be acceptable if their cultivation really did pull an equivalent amount of carbon from the atmosphere and store it in the soil. But this process is not permanent — crops are harvested and burned — and often the cultivation of biofuels actually reduces the amount of carbon a given landscape can store.

The establishment of biofuel plantations often takes place on formerly biodiverse, intact rainforest or peat wetland in South America or Southeast Asia. The destruction of these healthy ecosystems releases huge amounts of carbon into the atmosphere, as well as displacing wildlife. These lands are also home to Indigenous or traditional farming communities, who often face violent eviction or persecution at the hands of the state or big business, exposure to toxic agrichemicals, loss of food security, and the erosion of culturally important practices tied to these ecosystems.

Even when new soy or palm plantations are established on land that is already used for agriculture, this often displaces food crops and cattle ranching onto more marginal or uncultivated land, a process known as indirect land use change (ILUC). The result is shrinking wild habitats, accelerating deforestation, and rising food insecurity as prime farmland is diverted from dietary staples.

Industrial biofuel farms are also monocultures, covered in soil-depleting fertilizers and carcinogenic pesticides, and so provide little to no habitat while reducing the land’s natural ability to hold in CO2. They are also more vulnerable to severe forest fires.

These damaging impacts are what have led to the surge in demand for waste- and residue-based fuels. These are also often cheaper than pure vegetable oils. Common feedstocks such as used cooking oil or palm oil mill effluent can be made chemically identical to virgin vegetable oil, and several whistleblowers have revealed how sloppy auditing and overt fraud are widespread in sustainability certification processes that are entirely captured by industry-led bodies. This means that consumers cannot be confident that their biofuels are not directly fueling the destruction of natural ecosystems, the release of huge carbon bombs, and the dispossession of local communities. This is all without even touching on the occupational hazards and poor conditions suffered by workers in biorefineries.

Many campaigners tout electrofuels or ""e-fuels"" as potential alternatives, but they are very early in development, with no guarantee of ever becoming commercially (or environmentally) viable.

Yet, shipping presents an ongoing challenge. As biofuels are cheap and largely available, they will be the go-to solution of the industry, with the threat of unleashing an environmental disaster. That’s why members of my organization gathered outside the IMO headquarters in London during the negotiations, seeking to persuade delegates that biofuels cannot be part of shipping’s green transition.

Wind-assisted propulsion is doubtless a crucial tool in cutting both emissions and general energy usage over long distances at sea. But to fully address the problem of shipping’s enormous carbon footprint, policy must go beyond techno-fixes to encompass the unspoken truth at the heart of this debate — that demand reduction is required to bring shipping in line with necessary decarbonization targets. There simply have to be fewer container ships, making fewer, shorter journeys, and carrying less freight.

We may have to wait a year to find out. But whether shipping charts a bold course to shores unknown, or relies on tired industry-led false solutions designed to maintain the status quo, is yet to be decided.

Maritime industry analysts and financiers also question whether the IMO is the right organization for the job.","Any guesses on why the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) pitch for shipping’s first global carbon pricing system ran aground earlier this month?

Money, you say?

Bingo. But the projected annual US$15 billion bill facing container shipping lines and other carriers under the IMO’s Net Zero Framework (NZF) is only one line item in the decarbonization cost projections for maritime freight movement.

And money is only one shipping industry red flag.

As noted previously in the Substack Shipping News, the estimated annual cost to decarbonize maritime shipping ranges between US$8 billion and US$28 billion.

Make that US$90 billion if you factor in the investment in bunkering and the other energy transition infrastructure needed.

Overall, the bill for reaching the IMO's 2050 zero-emission shipping destination is estimated at US$1.6 trillion.

But that is just a ballpark, big-picture number.

A small example of the impact on everyday operating costs was provided during an October 8 review of the main findings in DNV’s Energy Transition Outlook 2025.

Eirik Ovrum, the report’s lead author and the principal maritime environmental technology consultant for the maritime industry risk-management company, noted that the IMO’s NZF “will effectively double fuel costs by around 2036.”

That raises another NZF red flag issue: what lower-carbon fuel and what technology required to turn that fuel into efficient and financially viable propulsion power will be commercially available to shipping fleets embarked on ambitious decarbonization initiatives?

The answer today is not enough of either. That explains in part why the adoption of heavy marine oil (HMO) alternatives remains minimal.

According to DNV data, 2,851 ships out of a global fleet of 120,936 have dual-fuel technology. That is just over 2%. And only 8.9% of total gross tonnage today is powered by alternative fuels. (See attached DNV chart.)

The HMO alternative for most of those dual-fuel ships (1,539) is liquefied natural gas (LNG).

The good news for NZF fans and decarbonization advocates is that 51% of new ship orders include dual-fuel technology.

Most of those are containerships.

But the IMO is not big on LNG.

DNV’s Maritime CEO Knut Ørbeck-Nilssen has taken the organization to task for erecting roadblocks that “make the pathway less attractive” for shipping to incorporate LNG in its decarbonization toolbox, even though approximately 600 ships sailing today have dual-fuel LNG engines, and another 700 on order will have that technology.

Lower carbon propulsion fuel availability is a major concern for ocean carriers.

Ørbeck-Nilssen has estimated that to hit its 2030 20% emissions reduction target, the maritime shipping sector will need between one-quarter and one-third of the projected global supply of low-GHG fuels.

During DNV’s October 8 session, Ovrum speculated that ocean carriers could only source enough biodiesel to hit that 2030 goal if “road transportation stopped using biodiesel and gave it all to shipping.”

And that is just the fuel-use and availability side of the energy transition equation. Other challenges include the complexities and costs of refitting ships with dual-fuel technologies, allocating space aboard vessels for less energy-dense fuels, and incorporating costly and complex onboard carbon capture systems.

But another red flag raised following the U.S.A.’s NZF rejection in August is this: should a UN agency be entrusted with instituting and policing the initiative and collecting and disbursing the levies raised?

IMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez thinks so.

At DNV’s September 16 launch of its Energy Transition Outlook 2025 report, Dominguez was confident that member states at the Extraordinary Session of the IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee in London would approve the initiative.

During his discussion with Ørbeck-Nilssen, he downplayed doubts about the approval.

Dominguez told the audience that “there is a consensus to move forward” with the framework.

“There are disagreements in some areas. And you know, we have member states that have agreed to the compromise approach … on the understanding that there is further work to do. We have … concerns that we need to take note of and then act upon. But it doesn’t mean that we’re divided. So, I’m still confident that we will continue to move forward [in] October.”

Dominguez got the month right, but not the year.

Countries opted to delay the NZF adoption vote to October 2026, which could push its implementation down the road to 2030.

In the meantime, America’s NZF opposition is another example of its distrust of the UN.

Maritime industry analysts and financiers also question whether the IMO is the right organization for the job.

John Lightbourn, a commercial shipping financier and the founder of U.S.-based Cavalier Shipping, suggested that the NZF implementation delay “could ultimately lead to a more resilient decarbonization framework — perhaps an acknowledgment that the IMO and, in turn, the UN, might not be the right body to oversee such a measure.”

He added that waning U.S. financial support for the UN raises questions about where funds collected under the NZF would end up and “whether financial pressures could arise to such a level that IMO will feel compelled to divert funds collected under the NZF to cover shortfalls in the UN’s operating budget.”

Shipping consultant Darren Shelton agreed that delaying NZF implementation might be better in the long run.

In a LinkedIn post, the Moran Shipping Agencies sales director wrote that “the postponement, while frustrating, may be the only responsible choice.”

He maintained that it would provide “a pause long enough to ask whether the IMO’s traditional structure can still manage a borderless industry shaped by private enterprise and accelerating technology.”

Shelton added that “progress in shipping has always depended on realism … Ports, fuels, and safety rules evolve through collaboration between practitioners, not speeches by politicians.”

“It is important for me and for everyone to recognise that last week was not a normal IMO meeting. That's why I say that we shouldn't be rated as an organisation in relation to the postponement that took place, but instead on the fact that — like everybody else right now — we are dealing with different changes, different geopolitical situations, and we need to adapt.

“We need to learn from these scenarios, adapt and move forward, and that's exactly what IMO is doing. Just this Monday, we continue the work on decarbonisation to address some of the concerns that were raised last week, related to how this is going to be implemented, how it's going to be managed, the administration of the fund, the certification, etc.”

Rather than that work taking place between adoption and entry into force of NZF, the work now takes place before its adoption. Given the contentious geopolitics around the meeting, Dominguez said the result was good.

“Whenever there were comments in the room… the most important thing is that the member states, the delegates, are talking to each other. Those that had different views [were] in the same room, and we're not going to find the agreements right away, because we need to understand those comments. We need to address them with further discussions, with further data. That is how multilateralism continues to work, and is at the centre of everything that we do at IMO. So again, a silver lining — the member states are talking to each other.”

As a former chair of MEPC, the IMO’s environmental work is a pillar of Dominguez’s term as secretary general. Another topic he has given full support to is diversity in shipping, where progress has been slower than expected.

“The recent IMO-WISTA survey showed us that even though we have more participation and engagement with the survey , the numbers are not reflecting all the effort that has been put into it,” said Dominguez. Awareness of the issue and the survey have increased, but room for improvement remains.

In July, Dominguez presented IMO’s internal gender and diversity strategy to the IMO Council to help the secretariat and member states take action on diversity within their work. Areas of work across IMO such as revision of the STCW convention, decarbonisation, and autonomous ships are all opportunities to attract women and focus on the younger generation, he said.

“Progress is there. We just need to be relentless in not backing down, and whenever there are challenges, just continue to power through with the actions that were taken and demonstrate progress,” said Dominguez.

Behind the scenes at IMO, progress has also been made on the criminalisation of seafarers through diplomatic engagement with member states following guidelines set by the legal committee this year.

“I have to say, the member states, the IMO representatives from the different diplomatic sectors, have been very engaging with us. They provide their feedback once they contact the national authorities and that allows us to actually make progress in some of the cases.”

Dominguez said there was work to be done to enhance relationships and cooperation with the International Organisation for Migration for mutual benefit on a topic that is outside of IMO’s scope, but affects the shipping industry.

“We need to understand each other better in order to address situations like when seafarers are not able to get visas, or even shore leave because of migration policies,” said Dominguez.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltdcfe6aab5515629e/bltad6e73e3f41ec0ac/68fa62a1590d4612e22b3ff6/WISTA-AGM-2025-Credit-Emma-Howell.jpeg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-10-23 17:17:07.685245

Both Greece and Cyprus broke ranks from the EU position against delaying adoption of the framework, deviating from established EU protocols of ensuring a unified bloc vote of 27 member states.

Their decision to abstain from the vote left other EU states and senior officials from within the European Commission “furious”, according to several member state officials who spoke to Lloyd’s List on condition of anonymity.

The commission is waiting for a legal service opinion before considering options, however, given the vote to delay was not a written part of the coordinated position of the EU states agreed in advance, Greece and Cyprus are likely to argue they did not break EU protocols.

If an infringement case cannot be stacked up, other avenues of reprisals against Greece and Cyprus may be on the cards with state aid clearance for maritime a potential target to make a point.

Each EU member state has state aid guidelines for maritime transport covering everything from tonnage tax to social security schemes for seafarers. These have to be cleared by the European Commission.

“It was an absolute catastrophe and what they did was a disgrace,” said one EU member state representative who was present during the IMO voting.

“We can do nothing if we are not 27 and stick together, and they knew that.”

EU member states had previously agreed to support the adoption of the IMO net zero strategy and the Net-Zero Framework.

Greece, however, remains unapologetic over the unprecedented decision to not vote with fellow EU states and on Tuesday moved to remove all reference to the IMO agreement from the bloc’s joint negotiating position for this year’s COP30 climate summit.

According to reports first carried in Politico and later confirmed independently by Lloyd’s List, Athens objected to a single passage, the final paragraph of the text, that “welcome[d]” the IMO measures “as the first legally binding global sectoral climate regulation that will contribute to the reduction of emissions from shipping”.

Greece had opposed any mention of the IMO levy and rejected several attempts at compromise. With the text requiring unanimous approval from the EU’s 27 governments, the IMO reference was deleted entirely.

According to EU shipping officials this all amounts to a hardening of Greek opposition to EU climate policy in maritime that will continue to have repercussions for the EU negotiating position inside the IMO and other bodies.

Neither the European Commission nor the Greek government have responded to Lloyd’s List’s requests for comment on the issue.

Following the IMO vote, Greece’s Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, published an opinion article in the Financial Times questioning the pace of decarbonisation policy and apparently contradicting established EU positions.

“While European countries still burn coal in our power plants and oil to heat our homes and factories, we are pushing for the decarbonisation of ships and planes and of the most difficult industrial processes,” Mitsotakis wrote.

“This emphasis on tackling all emissions at once is shortsighted… It is also increasingly obvious that the last few steps to achieving climate neutrality will be very expensive. We ought to tread carefully, maintain flexibility and make sure that the maths adds up,” he continued.",https://www.lloydslist.com/-/media/lloyds-list/images/regulation/2025-new-pictures/mepc-oct-2025-day-3-alt.png?rev=82528b67f6f1449087f5f2c83caa5d79,N,,2025-10-23 14:16:30.048788

The UN's International Maritime Organization (IMO) will decide whether to adopt a carbon emissions pricing scheme for global shipping, a move backed by an EU-led coalition but strongly opposed by the United States, reported Reuters.

The proposal, tabled for adoption at the IMO's environmental committee follows a preliminary deal reached in April. The US withdrew from those talks and has since threatened retaliatory measures, including port fees and visa restrictions.

The US State Department said on October 11 it would target countries supporting what it called a 'European-led neocolonial export of global climate regulations.' Meanwhile, the European Commission reaffirmed its support for the IMO measure in a statement on October 12.

The draft rules would impose fees on ships over 5,000 tons that exceed emissions thresholds, while rewarding vessels using cleaner fuels. Ships emitting below a separate threshold would receive surplus units.

Vessels must either purchase remedial units or pay penalties if they exceed the emissions limit. Revenues will be collected by a new IMO Net-Zero Fund, though distribution details remain undecided.

Research from University College London estimates the fuel standard could generate US$11 billion to$12 billion annually between 2028 and 2030, with most ships expected to pay penalties in the early years.

The us has warned of retaliatory measures against nations supporting a proposed carbon emissions tax for shipping, as the UN's International Maritime Organization (IMO) works to adopt it's Net-Zero Framework, reports New York's FreightWaves.

The US State Department called the plan a 'European-led neocolonial export of global climate regulations' and said it would not accept any agreement that unfairly burdens American interests. The IMO vote is scheduled for October 14-17 in London.

Under the proposal, vessel operators must report greenhouse gas emissions annually. Ships exceeding limits will pay fees, while those using cleaner fuels will receive incentives. The IMO would collect revenues through a Net-Zero Fund.

The US warned it may block vessels from its ports, impose visa restrictions on crews, and apply penalties to government contracts and liquefied natural gas terminals. Additional port fees and sanctions on officials backing climate policies are also being considered.

The statement was signed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, and Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy. They urged IMO members to reject the Net-Zero Framework and prioritise economic and energy security.

Ocean carriers have already taken steps to reduce emissions. About 41 per cent of containerships on order are designed for alternative fuels such as liquefied natural gas or ammonia. The largest ships account for 85 per cent of sector emissions.

Nearly all ocean-going ships are built outside the US, with 51 per cent in China, 28 per cent in South Korea, and 15 per cent in Japan. The US reversal on IMO cooperation echoes its stance on the International Criminal Court, which it helped develop but never ratified.

The NZF had been in the works for several years and had gained wide consensus before IMO’s recent decision. The decision creates considerable uncertainty in the sector, coming amid intense U.S. opposition that appears unlikely to wane, and the MEPC continues to pursue adoption of the NZF.

Key Takeaways

The MEPC deferred a decision to make the NZF legally binding until October 2026

The U.S. vehemently opposed adoption of the NZF, threatening to impose trade, port, and other restrictions on countries supporting the measure

The MEPC will continue work to define fundamental elements of the NZF and achieve consensus on its adoption

European Union (EU) measures regulating shipping GHG emissions will remain in place, and other countries may consider similar measures

The IMO decision creates considerable regulatory uncertainty for stakeholders across the shipping supply chain, and they should prepare to engage policymakers on several fronts

Background

The NZF would establish a legally binding regulatory framework to achieve net-zero GHG emissions ""by or around, i.e. close to, 2050,"" as articulated in the 2023 IMO Strategy on Reduction of GHG Emissions from Ships, agreed by the MEPC in July 2023. If adopted, the NZF would be included as a new chapter 5 in Annex VI to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL).

The NZF combines a global fuel standard and GHG emissions pricing mechanism applicable to ships over 5,000 gross tonnage. The scheme endorsed by the MEPC in April creates two tiers of GHG fuel intensity (GFI) targets, a Base Target (BT) and a more stringent Direct Compliance Target (DCT). In simplified terms, ships that fail to meet the targets generate ""compliance deficits"" and would be required to acquire Remedial Units (RUs), while ships that exceed the DCT could generate bankable Surplus Units (SUs). RUs would be acquired by making ""pricing contributions"" to a yet-to-be-established IMO Net-Zero Fund. Ships that use ""Zero or Near-Zero GHG emission technologies, fuels and/or energy sources"" (ZNZs) would be eligible to receive ""Rewards"" (annual compensation) from the IMO Net-Zero Fund.

Recent IMO Actions

The MEPC approved the text of the NZF at its 83rd meeting in April (MEPC 83) and had targeted formal approval needed to make it legally binding at its extraordinary session held last week (October 14-17). However, support for the NZF weakened in the intervening months amid U.S. threats of trade and other retaliation measures against countries supporting the measure. The MEPC ultimately adopted a resolution to adjourn the ES until October 2026 without approving the NZF.

In a statement issued after the extraordinary session, the MEPC affirmed its intention to continue work on developing NZF implementation guidelines to further define fundamental aspects of the scheme and achieve consensus on adopting the measure. Work to develop these guidelines is already beginning at this week's meeting of the Intersessional Working Group on the Reduction of Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Ships.

The U.S. first signaled its ""unequivocal"" opposition to the NZF on April 9, 2025, when it announced its withdrawal from MEPC 83, urging other governments to ""reconsider"" their support for the agreement and warning it could consider ""reciprocal measures."" The U.S. escalated these threats in a joint statement issued August 12, 2025, by the U.S. Departments of State, Transportation, Energy, and Commerce, and ultimately detailed retaliatory measures it planned to consider in a policy statement issued on the eve of last week's MEPC ES, including targeted port access and visa restrictions, sanctions, penalties, and port fees. The U.S. has made clear its intent to ""levy these remedies against nations that sponsor this European-led neocolonial export of global climate regulations.""

IMO adoption of the NZF would have triggered a process to consider changes to European Union (EU) measures regulating shipping GHGs - the Emissions Trading System (ETS) (Directive (EU) 2023/959) and FuelEU Maritime regulation (Regulation (EU) 2023/1805). The decision to postpone consideration of the NZF means these measures remain intact and, more broadly, that the shipping industry will continue to face a patchwork of regional and/or country-specific regulations governing GHG emissions and maritime fuel.

What’s Next

Going forward, ship owners, charterers, and other supply-chain stakeholders, including fuel suppliers and ship builders, should monitor developments closely and engage on multiple fronts, including:

IMO/MEPC efforts to achieve consensus on the NZF, which could require negotiating significant changes, likely with significant U.S. input;

IMO/MEPC efforts to better define key elements of the NZF through implementation guidelines to be developed by IMO bodies in the coming months;

U.S. efforts to gain leverage over NZF negotiations through a variety of trade or punitive measures; and

Efforts in other regions and countries, including the EU, to develop and/implement measures to regulate GHG emissions from ships that visit their ports.

Finally, companies in other sectors should note that the Trump administration's approach to the NZF mirrors its broader pattern of leveraging international environmental disputes to advance domestic industrial priorities and leverage bilateral trade. As such, companies affected by other international schemes, such as the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), should consider how the Trump administration's approach to the NZF may inform its approach to these schemes.",https://natlawreview.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_image/public/2025-10/global%20infrastructure%20trade%20import%20export%20logistics%20shipping%20manufacturing%20cargo%20vessel_0.jpg.webp?itok=_4jpsCoi,N,,2025-10-23 12:20:21.067502

DNV says a cost-effective and proven nuclear fuel cycle, tailored for maritime use, must be developed by the industry.
""Crucially, storage and disposal of spent nuclear fuel are fundamental to the functionality and credibility of the supply chain.
The development of a commercial maritime nuclear industry also needs to be supported by a ""predictable and internationally accepted"" regulatory framework, DNV says.
""It demands coordinated global action, involving a wide range of actors across the maritime industry, regulators, and society in general.","The shipping industry consumes some 350 million tonnes of fossil fuel annually and accounts for about 3% of total worldwide carbon emissions. In July 2023, the shipping industry, via the International Maritime Organization (IMO), approved new targets for greenhouse gas emission reductions, aiming to reach net-zero emissions by, or around, 2050.

""Nuclear propulsion, once regarded as a distant prospect, is now under active consideration as a real option for the commercial maritime fleet,"" DNV Senior Principal Researcher Ole Christen Reistad says in the foreword a new white paper. ""Shipyards and shipowners are exploring its potential and weighing the promise of virtually emission-free power against the complexity of introducing such a transformative technology into commercial fleets.""

DNV's white paper - titled Maritime nuclear propulsion: Technologies, commercial viability, and regulatory challenges for nuclear-powered vessels - highlights how maritime nuclear technologies differ from land-based reactors, and emphasises the need to address technological, regulatory, and commercial factors in the effort to understand the potential role of nuclear propulsion. The paper addresses the main elements of the future maritime fuel cycle – including fuel management, waste handling, vessel construction and operation, and oversight of nuclear supply chains – and presents the reactor technologies most likely to be adopted by shipowners. Advances in automation, digitalisation, and modular design are identified as critical enablers of safety, security, and non-proliferation of future nuclear fuels and reactors, thereby paving the way for public acceptance.

""All maritime nuclear technologies will differ from land-based equivalents due to some key characteristics, such as mobility, exposure to harsh sea conditions, and operational profile,"" the paper notes. ""Further, maritime installations will vary significantly depending on their purpose - propulsion (nuclear-powered ships) or power generation (floating nuclear power plants).""

DNV says a cost-effective and proven nuclear fuel cycle, tailored for maritime use, must be developed by the industry. This includes establishing clearly defined roles and responsibilities across the supply chain, from fuel production and reactor integration to loading, exchange, and disposal. ""Crucially, storage and disposal of spent nuclear fuel are fundamental to the functionality and credibility of the supply chain. Reactor design and fuel type will directly influence these requirements, and these factors must be addressed before any operating licence is granted.""

As part of this, it says provisions for the whole maritime fuel cycle - including long-term waste management - are essential, not only for regulatory compliance but also for advancing public acceptance.

The development of a commercial maritime nuclear industry also needs to be supported by a ""predictable and internationally accepted"" regulatory framework, DNV says. Organisations such as the IMO and the International Atomic Energy Agency must lead efforts to establish standards for fuel management, ship construction, and operational protocols. ""Classification societies will play a critical role in enabling global adoption, helping to overcome the fragmented nature of the land-based nuclear industry and fostering a standardised maritime approach,"" it says.

DNV noted: ""The regulatory landscape for nuclear shipping will likely exceed what the maritime industry is accustomed to, opening the door to multiple future system configurations. By identifying key actors, their mandates, and the need for coordination, regulatory roadmaps outlined in this white paper offer essential guidance. As roles multiply, clarifying interfaces becomes increasingly important - something these roadmaps help address by mapping key interdependencies.""

The success of future maritime nuclear installations will also depend on the development of compelling business models, according to DNV. It says these must reflect the commercial realities of shipping and provide a clear understanding of total cost of ownership, especially across the entire fuel cycle. ""Cost-competitiveness could be significantly enhanced through modular and standardised approaches, which streamline construction, simplify maintenance, provide independent assurance, and facilitate regulatory approval across jurisdictions.""

DNV case studies presented in the paper show that nuclear can out-perform other technologies under both low and high fuel price scenarios. A reactor cost below USD18,000/kW could be competitive if full decarbonisation is achieved by 2050, it suggests, while costs below USD8,000/kW could be viable even without full decarbonisation.

""Realising the potential of nuclear propulsion in maritime requires more than technological readiness,"" DNV concludes. ""It demands coordinated global action, involving a wide range of actors across the maritime industry, regulators, and society in general. With strategic investment and international collaboration, nuclear energy could become a cornerstone of the maritime energy transition, delivering safe, efficient, and zero-emission propulsion for the global fleet.""

Approval of container ship design

The release of the white paper came as DNV awarded South Korea's HD Korea Shipbuilding & Offshore Engineering (HD KSOE) - a subsidiary of HD Hyundai - Approval in Principle for a new 15,000 TEU-class container vessel design powered by small modular reactor (SMR) technology. The vessel concept incorporates a supercritical CO2-based power generation system, which can provide higher thermal efficiency and a reduced equipment footprint compared to conventional steam-based systems.

DNV Technical Director Geir Dugstad (left) and HD KSOE Senior Vice President Sungkon Han (Image: DNV)

An Approval in Principle (AiP) is an independent assessment of a concept within a defined framework of requirements. It confirms the feasibility of the design and verifies that no significant technical barriers exist to its implementation.

During the development of the ship design concept, the DNV team worked closely with HD KSOE to assess the vessel's overall safety and the design of the advanced power generation system. This review included the vessel's main functions, power supply and overall approach to safety. In May 2025, HD KSOE and DNV also conducted a HAZID (Hazard Identification) workshop at DNV's headquarters in Oslo to identify potential risks and accident scenarios for nuclear-powered vessels and to guide improvements in the design.

""This SMR-powered container vessel concept represents a key milestone in our efforts to explore alternative fuels for decarbonising shipping,"" said HD KSOE Chief Technology Officer Chang Kwangpil. ""The design focuses intensely on the safety of the vessel and advancing the propulsion system in the application of SMR technology. In addition, we have developed a novel shielding and containment system, which is designed to maintain reactor safety and vessel survivability even in the event of collisions, groundings, or sinking accidents. We will continue to collaborate with global partners to advance marine nuclear technologies.""

""With little recent experience in utilising nuclear power for cargo vessels, this AiP represents an important first step in building the technical verification process for nuclear-powered vessels,"" said Geir Dugstad, Technical Director at DNV. ""We are very pleased to award KSOE this new AiP, which is the well-deserved result of an intensive and productive cooperation, which we look forward to continuing as this exciting technology continues to develop.""

Previously, HD KSOE obtained Approval in Principle from the American Bureau of Shipping for a 15,000 TEU-class container ship design model applying SMR technology.",https://world-nuclear-news.org/images/articles/MaritimeNuclearPropulsionwhitepaper(DNV)_43508.jpg,N,,2025-10-23 14:16:40.217150

Stockholm, 23 October, 2025: – Ahead of next week’s session of the Nordic Council, the Clean Arctic Alliance today called on Nordic governments to adopt a resolution on polar fuels during the meeting, and together commit to support an International Maritime Organization (IMO)regulation that would require cleaner maritime fuels, which would result in lower emissions of black carbon by ships when operating in the Arctic.

The deadline for concrete proposals for such a regulation to be submitted to the thirteenth session of the IMO’s technical committee that addresses pollution prevention and response (PPR13, February 2026) is December 5th.

“Ahead of a crucial meeting of the IMO next February, the Clean Arctic Alliance is calling for the Member States of the International Maritime Organization to develop and adopt a mandatory regulation which would require that only polar fuels can be used by shipping in the Arctic”, said Dr Sian Prior, Lead Advisor to the Clean Arctic Alliance.. “A resolution on polar fuels adopted by Nordic governments next week would send a strong message to IMO Member States that action is urgently needed to protect the Arctic from the impacts of shipping emissions.”

“Black carbon is a climate superpollutant produced when fossil fuels are burned”, said Prior. “Black carbon has a disproportionate impact because it both heats the atmosphere – and when released from ship exhausts and when near to the Arctic it settles onto snow and ice, speeding up the melting and exposing darker land and sea beneath, which continue to absorb more heat. It is the loss of the planet’s reflectivity – or albedo – which is contributing to the fast pace of warming seen in the Arctic.”

“Black carbon emissions from ships burning oil-based fuels have more than doubled in the last decade, yet a simple and easy solution is to require shipping to use widely available distillate fuels with lower black carbon emissions when operating in and near to the Arctic”, said Prior.

About Black Carbon, Polar Fuels, and the Arctic

Black carbon is a short-lived climate pollutant, produced by the incomplete burning of fossil fuels, with an impact more than three thousand times that of CO2 over a 20 year period. It makes up around one-fifth of international shipping’s climate impact. Not only does it contribute to warming while in the atmosphere, black carbon accelerates melting if deposited onto snow and ice – hence it has a disproportionate impact when released in and near to the Arctic.

The melting snow and ice exposes darker areas of land and water and these dark patches then absorb further heat from the sun and the reflective capacity of the planet’s polar ice caps is severely reduced. More heat in the polar systems – results in increased melting. This is the loss of the albedo effect.

Declines in sea ice extent and volume are leading to a burgeoning social and environmental crisis in the Arctic, while cascading changes are impacting global climate and ocean circulation. Scientists have high confidence that processes are nearing points beyond which rapid and irreversible changes on the scale of multiple human generations are possible. Scientists say it is now too late to save summer Arctic sea ice, and research has shown that “preparations need to be made for the increased extreme weather across the northern hemisphere that is likely to occur as a result.”

Black carbon also has a negative impact on human health including premature death and harmful effects on the cardiovascular system (heart, blood and blood vessels), and recent research has found black carbon particles in the body tissues of foetuses, following inhalation by pregnant mothers.

The need to reduce emissions of black carbon because of both the climate and health impacts has been long recognised. On land, considerable effort has been made to ban dirtier fuels in power stations, to install diesel particulate filters on land-based transport, and to improve the burning of dry wood – all to reduce emissions of black carbon and improve air quality. However, at sea the same efforts have not yet been made.

In a paper submitted to a meeting of the IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC 82/5/2*: Regulating Black Carbon emissions from international shipping impacting the Arctic) NGOs called on IMO Member States to consider the development of a new regulation for inclusion in MARPOL Annex VI (the main international treaty addressing air pollution prevention requirements from ships) which would identify suitable polar fuels, for example distillate fuels, such DMA or DMZ, to deliver an immediate fuel-based reduction in black carbon emissions from international shipping impacting the Arctic. The paper develops the concept of “polar fuels” discussed at technical subcommittee meeting (PPR 11) and sets out the fuel characteristics that would distinguish polar fuels from residual fuels and thus lead to fuel-based reductions in ship Black Carbon emissions if mandated for use in and near the Arctic. Polar fuels were discussed further at a meeting of the PPR technical subcommittee in January 2025, following which the Clean Arctic Alliance welcomed the broad support from IMO member states, and parts of the fuel and shipping industry, for the further development of the polar fuels concept.

Next year’s Summit will be held in Shanghai, home to one of the world’s busiest container ports.

The All Aboard Alliance launched its new 2026-2030 strategy for improving lives at sea.

A governance task force has been convened to address gaps in the enforcement of maritime governance and will present its initial actions by next year’s Summit.

23 OCTOBER 2025, ANTWERP – Only days after the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) Member States voted to postpone a decision on the Net-Zero Framework (NZF) by 12 months, more than 200 industry leaders, experts, and influential decision-makers met in Antwerp at the Global Maritime Forum Annual Summit 2025 to discuss the path forward for the sector.

“This year’s Annual Summit has provided a crucial opportunity for leaders from across the globe and maritime value chain to come together address some of the sector’s most pressing issues, including what needs to happen over the next year to set the stage for the adoption of the NZF,” said Global Maritime Forum CEO Johannah Christensen. “One of the overwhelming messages I’ve heard from participants over the last two days is how hopeful and energised they feel after the Summit, particularly coming off the back of such a disappointing outcome last week. The mood has certainly shifted.”

Throughout the Summit, IMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez also encouraged assembled industry leaders to think of the NZF delay as a pause of the adoption itself, but certainly not a pause on the work underpinning the framework.

“Shipping continues to be a global industry, and as such, needs global regulations. Yes, we have paused now on the adoption, but the work on the implementation continues,” he said in a video interview. “This extra year gives us the chance to connect with all the stakeholders and parties in order to address the questions that were raised, including the lack of clarity around the framework,” he said at a press event.

One of the themes that emerged from Summit discussions was the important role of the EU and China, as well as developing regions like Africa, as emerging centres of supply and demand for zero-emission fuels and champions that can reaffirm the support for the NZF that existed when it was agreed in April.

Shanghai to host 2026 Summit

China’s significance was underscored with the announcement that next year’s Annual Summit will be held in Shanghai, an important global maritime hub and home to one of the world’s busiest container ports.

The 2026 Summit will be supported by Shanghai Maritime University and the People’s Government of Hongkou District.

“Shanghai Maritime University is pleased to collaborate with the Global Maritime Forum, Shanghai Municipal Transportation Commission, and Shanghai Hongkou District in providing support to the Annual Summit 2026. We look forward to contributing toward an event that will bring the industry together to help drive the energy transition and digitalisation of the shipping industry,” said a representative of Shanghai Maritime University.

“Hongkou District extends its warmest welcome and steadfast support for the Global Maritime Forum Annual Summit 2026 to be held next October. As a core functional zone of the Shanghai International Shipping Center, Hongkou boasts a rich history and profound maritime heritage, having previously gathered many of the world's leading ports, shipping enterprises and institutions,” said a representative of Hongkou District.

Evolution of the All Aboard Alliance

On the second day of the Summit, the All Aboard Alliance launched its new 2030 strategy and industry ambitions for making at-sea careers more safe, attractive, and inclusive.

“With this new strategy underpinning our work, the All Aboard Alliance community can begin addressing the deep-rooted, systemic challenges facing the roughly two million seafarers who are the backbone of global trade,” said Global Maritime Forum Director of Human Sustainability Susanne Justesen. “It will require us to question these entrenched structures, ask hard questions, and confront uncomfortable truths—and it’s something none of us can do alone. We invite companies to join us in working towards a future where seafarers are at the heart of every voyage.”

The Alliance aims to track progress annually and build transparency, showcase what good looks like by defining better standards for living and working at sea, and align financial incentives towards industry adoption of those standards.

New governance taskforce convened

A key theme that has emerged in recent years is the need for strengthened governance to address uncertainty and geopolitical risks.

In Antwerp, assembled industry leaders expressed growing concern about the dark fleet putting the environment and crew safety at risk. Participants pledged to establish a task force, comprised of industry leaders from across the value chain, to explore ways to address gaps in the enforcement of maritime governance. The task force will convene in the coming weeks and present its initial actions by next year’s Summit.

The 2025 Summit was supported by partners CMB.TECH and the Port of Antwerp-Bruges.

“CMB.TECH is delighted to have partnered with the Global Maritime Forum for this year’s Annual Summit in Antwerp, the beating heart of maritime Europe,” said Alexander Saverys, CEO of CMB.TECH. “Now more than ever, our industry needed to come together to debate about trade, peace, and the future of our planet, all of which are under threat. But this is not our first shipping crisis. For more than 4,000 years, maritime men and women have proven that perseverance, vision, and bravery can make the world a better place. Energised by the positive shipping vibes at the Antwerp Summit, CMB.TECH will continue do its part.”

Jacques Vandermeiren, CEO of Port of Antwerp-Bruges, reiterated the timeliness of this year’s Summit in the wider maritime landscape.

""As the second largest port city in Europe, Antwerp has long been a meeting point for global trade. It has been our privilege to host shipowners, charterers, ports, crew managers, financiers, insurers and many other key stakeholders from across the maritime value chain here in Antwerp at the Global Maritime Forum Annual Summit 2025. At a time of uncertainty in the world, the energy and ideas shared throughout the event give us confidence in the industry’s ability to work together toward a more resilient and sustainable future,"" he says.

Denmark, Finland and Sweden are already banning scrubber washwater discharges in its territorial waters since summer 2025.
the OSPAR Commission for the North-East Atlantic decided to prohibit the discharge of scrubber washwater in internal waters from 2027 onwards.
That an organization naming itself the Clean Shipping Alliance is devoted to defending scrubbers and the continued use of heavy fuel oil is, at best, ironic.
A ban of heavy fuel oil moreover prohibits oil pests with their devastating environmental impact.","As the shipping industry faces mounting pressure to reduce emissions, one of its most misleading compromises has been the use of exhaust gas cleaning systems—commonly known as scrubbers.

Installed on vessels to remove sulphur oxides from the exhaust of heavy fuel oil (HFO), scrubbers allow ships to continue burning the cheapest and dirtiest fuel available, all while claiming to meet environmental standards.

The Science is Clear

The shipping industry emits vast quantities of air pollutants that threaten human health and the environment. To address this, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) introduced sulphur limits in marine fuels.

Rather than switching to cleaner fuels, many shipowners opted for scrubbers, enabling them to continue burning toxic HFO while ""cleaning"" the exhaust gases from sulphur oxides, they shift the pollution from the air to the sea.

Scrubber washwater contains a toxic cocktail of heavy metals (nickel, vanadium, copper), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and acidic compounds.

Peer-reviewed research by trusted institutions (e.g. Chalmers paper in Nature Sustainability, Jalkanen et al. 2024, Zapata Restrepo et al. 2024, Genitsaris et al. 2023, Picone et al. 2023), government studies (e.g. Schmolke et al. 2020, EU EMERGE 2021, BSH-ImpEx 2023) — have repeatedly shown that scrubber washwater is toxic to marine life.

ImpEx Project found that many washwater samples caused high to extreme toxicity and even mutagenic effects. Studies found measurable effects on biodiversity, reproduction, and nutrient cycles in the marine food web even at dilutions of just 1.5% (e.g. EU EMERGE project).

Despite claims from the scrubber lobby that washwater quickly disperses, research shows that discharges especially were it amasses like in harbours, estuaries, and busy shipping lanes the toxics accumulate in sediments over time, degrade water quality, and harm sensitive ecosystems.

Some pollutants, like PAHs and heavy metals, persist in the environment and bioaccumulate even in the food chain—eventually ending up on our plates.

Studies show both acute and chronic toxicity, including mutagenicity. Multiple studies show significant effects on zooplankton, microalgae, cyanobacteria, and fish.

The German Environment Agency has recently concluded that scrubber washwater discharge ""poses an unacceptable risk.""

The Legal Landscape of Scrubbers

The continued use of scrubbers is also legally dubious.

Under the EU Water Framework Directive (Article 4), member states are legally obliged to prevent deterioration of their water bodies and reduce pollution from priority hazardous substances—many of which are found in scrubber discharge.

Also, the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (e.g. Article 1) requires a precautionary approach to marine protection. Permitting scrubber use, especially nearshore, flies in the face of these obligations.

Similarly, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS, Article 195) requires states to protect the marine environment from all sources of pollution. States must ensure that damage or hazards are not shifted, directly or indirectly, from one area to another, nor that one type of pollution is merely transformed into another.

Allowing ships to dump toxic washwater in sensitive marine areas raises serious questions about whether these obligations are being met.

MARPOL Annex VI (Regulation 4.4) permits the use of ""equivalent"" technologies only under the condition that they do not impair or damage the environment, human health, property, or the resources of other States.

Given the documented environmental risks associated with scrubber discharges, it is difficult to see how their use can be considered compliant with this provision.

Recent Bans on Scrubber Washwater Discharges

Given the limited pace of action by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) as the global regulator of shipping, it is both legitimate and necessary for individual states or regional bodies, like OSPAR, to adopt complementary measures addressing the use of scrubbers.

The science is clear. The legal obligations are binding. And cleaner alternatives exist.

It's no surprise, then, that a growing number of regions are taking action. E.g. Denmark, Finland and Sweden are already banning scrubber washwater discharges in its territorial waters since summer 2025.

Several major ports and regional authorities have already imposed their own restrictions. Recently, e.g. the OSPAR Commission for the North-East Atlantic decided to prohibit the discharge of scrubber washwater in internal waters from 2027 onwards.

This is a policy wave that's gaining momentum—and for good reason.

It's time for governments, regional regulators, and port authorities around the globe to follow the lead of Denmark and others by implementing full bans on scrubber washwater discharges.

Neglecting Peer-Reviewed Science

Despite a growing body of peer-reviewed evidence and an increasing number of regulatory restrictions around the world, the industry's main lobby group continues to downplay scientific findings to defend the status quo.

That an organization naming itself the Clean Shipping Alliance is devoted to defending scrubbers and the continued use of heavy fuel oil is, at best, ironic. The group's name suggests a commitment to clean seas, yet its actions support the prolonged use of the dirtiest fuels available.

While the extent of environmental harm from scrubber discharges can be debated, there is no serious argument that this practice represents clean, cleaner or by any means sustainable shipping.

Clean Shipping Alliances criticism to OSPAR's decision to ban scrubber washwater discharge relies on misleading timelines, a denial of peer-reviewed science and a legal misinterpretation of OSPAR's rights and obligations under environmental law.

Their cherry-picked studies and often industry-funded research with known limitations, typically assumes high dilution, short exposure times, and ignore cumulative or long-term effects.

In a Nutshell

Scrubbers exist to protect the profits of companies unwilling to invest in cleaner alternatives, not to protect the environment or public health.

Not only at the expense of human health and the environment but also at the expense of competitors that switch to cleaner fuels. If we see two ships next to each other the one with the scrubber is always worse for the environment, because the ship without scrubber complies with regulation by using a less toxic fuel and therefore posing decreased risk to health and nature.

""We are currently operating with biogas and HVO (hydrotreated vegetable oil), so we are operating completely carbon neutral,"" Teir said.

""We are also installing more battery capacity which will reduce the need for fuel and other resources for energy,"" he said, explaining that more battery power would increase capacity from today's 2.2 MWh to 12.6 MWh.

That will make it the largest marine battery hybrid system in operation globally.

New European Union rules on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and increasing renewable and low-emission fuels in the maritime sector came into force this year.

Member states of the International Maritime Organization were also set to formally adopt the Net Zero Framework -- the first global carbon-pricing system -- on October 17, but the vote was postponed by a year after the United States opposed the carbon-cutting plan and threatened to impose sanctions against countries backing it.

The global shipping industry, which transports nearly 90 percent of the world's cargo and still relies heavily on fossil fuels, is responsible for around two to three percent of global greenhouse gas emissions each year.

Pooling carbon deficit

Wasaline benefited from its collaboration with several large nearby tech and energy companies keen to test out their cutting edge emission-reduction technology on the vessel, ""a win-win situation for all parties involved"", Teir said.

""We are one of the smaller shipping companies in the world, so being a forerunner is also something that sets a little bit of a benchmark for the bigger ones,"" he added.

Because the ferry has met EU climate targets, it can use a new EU mechanism allowing it to sell the carbon emissions it ""saved"" to another shipping company, which can then mark it down as its own emission reduction.

""The pooling mechanism makes it economically viable to run 100 percent on biofuels,"" Teir said.

Fanny Devaux, deputy director of shipping at European NGO Transport & Environment, said Aurora Botnia demonstrated ""real progress in energy efficiency and electrification"".

But the shipping industry needs to steer away from biofuels, she said.

""There just isn't enough sustainable biowaste to power all the ships in the world.""

""The ultimate goal must be to replace fossil fuels with scalable fuels that can achieve deep, verifiable emission reductions without harming ecosystems,"" she said, citing e-fuels such as e-methanol, e-ammonia, and hydrogen made from renewable electricity.

Reducing energy consumption ""through operational and technical efficiency"" remained the most important rule in the energy transition, Devaux stressed.

Docking in the small Swedish port of Umea where the open sea glittered, still ice-free in October, captain Johannes Sjoholm said it felt like he was ""part of something bigger"" by ""challenging the old systems"".

""We hope to be a kind of pilot project for others to see and notice that it is possible to do this this way,"" he said.

Constraints

According to Hakan Agnevall, CEO of ship engine builder Wartsila, the postponed IMO vote ""opens the door to a fragmented landscape of carbon pricing mechanisms introduced by individual regions and countries"".

""The EU already has its system in place, while China is signalling plans for its own programs, adding complexity to global shipping,"" he told AFP in an email.

Devaux said the postponed vote ""introduces significant uncertainty for the shipping industry and clean tech investors"".

Wartsila is currently developing new engines for more climate-friendly fuels and energy efficient technology.

""We actually have the technologies. But getting a sufficient amount of fuels, making the whole equation financially viable, those are the biggest constraints right now,"" he said.","https://etimg.etb2bimg.com/thumb/msid-124757719,imgsize-60310,width-1200,height=627,overlay-etinfra,resizemode-75/news/ports-shipping/finnish-carbon-neutral-ferry-sets-global-benchmark-for-sustainable-shipping.jpg",N,,2025-10-23 10:22:22.496267

The delay, agreed during last week’s Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) meeting in London, may slow global climate progress and hinder efforts to decarbonise the maritime sector.

The NZF was intended to create a global regulatory base for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from shipping, including a fuel standard and a pricing mechanism. ESPO described the postponement as a missed opportunity to accelerate the transition to clean fuels and warned that it could extend the existing fragmentation caused by differing regional regulations.

According to ESPO, the decision comes despite strong calls from across the industry for a unified global approach that would ensure predictability and a level playing field. The organisation stated that the delay risks weakening the credibility of international climate leadership in the maritime sector.

ESPO welcomed the European Commission’s new strategy to promote a global clean and resilient transition, aimed at boosting climate action, clean technology, and sustainable value chains. To maintain progress, ESPO urged the Commission to adopt several measures, including tax exemptions for electricity used by ships at berth and zero-carbon fuels, subsidies and carbon contracts for difference to narrow the price gap with fossil fuels, and targeted use of EU Emissions Trading System revenues for port infrastructure supporting clean energy.

ESPO emphasised that the postponement should not be seen as cancellation, acknowledging that the IMO’s technical work continues. It called on governments, industry, and civil society to stay engaged in developing an ambitious and workable framework.

In the meantime, ESPO asked the European Commission to mitigate the negative effects of the EU’s regional measures on business competitiveness and to prepare for alignment between EU and future IMO regulations.

With abundant geothermal, wind, solar, and hydro resources, Kenya holds a strategic advantage in the emerging green hydrogen economy.

Clean shipping fuels, like green hydrogen and its derivatives, are rapidly emerging as key solutions for decarbonising global shipping.","With much of Africa’s trade flowing through its ports, the continent stands to benefit significantly from a transition to cleaner, more sustainable shipping.

Yet, Africa’s participation in the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) – the body that sets the rules for global shipping – remains limited and comparatively weaker than our engagement in climate negotiations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).

This October is Africa’s moment to articulate its ambitions and take decisive climate action. The IMO member States will vote on the Net-Zero Framework, a landmark regulatory package under the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL) that aims to make global shipping cleaner and eventually reach zero emissions by 2050.

If adopted, this regulatory package will signal to markets and investors that the age of fossil-fueled shipping is drawing to a close.

For African countries, this is more than a climate milestone – it is an economic opportunity. Cleaner shipping could open new markets, attract investment, and create green jobs across African ports and the maritime industry.

But this will only happen if African countries engage proactively, articulate their ambition clearly, and act decisively.

As the global shipping takes its push toward decarbonization, Africa stands at the cusp of a once-in-a-generation opportunity to lead in producing the clean fuels the sector will soon depend on.

From Kenya, where over 90% of electricity is generated from renewable sources such as geothermal and wind, to Namibia and South Africa, whose wide-open spaces offer some of the best solar energy conditions, Africa has the potential to become a global hub for clean fuel production.

But there’s an even stronger reason to double down on renewables: the rise of e-fuels.

e-fuels – such as green hydrogen, ammonia, and methanol – are made using renewable electricity and are essential to powering large vessels that cannot easily operate on batteries.

As the global shipping industry races to find sustainable fuel alternatives, countries rich in renewable energy potential could become major suppliers of these next-generation fuels.

For Africa, this transition could be transformative. The global push to decarbonise shipping can serve not only as a climate solution but also as a catalyst for Africa’s green industrialisation.

The global shipping industry moves almost 90% of global trade and emits about 3% of total greenhouse gas emissions, more than most countries. Cutting these emissions is no longer a choice; it is a necessity.

The IMO’s Net-Zero Framework represents a critical step forward – a blueprint for creating a predictable policy environment that can unlock investment in zero- and near-zero-emission fuels and technologies.

For African economies, this could mean a surge in global demand for the very products our renewable potential can produce.

Beyond exports, these fuels could also power domestic industries, reduce dependence on fossil fuel imports, and create green jobs in energy, engineering, and transport.

Timing, however, is of the essence. If the Net-Zero Framework is delayed or watered down, investors may look elsewhere. Africa’s window of opportunity is open now – but it won’t stay open forever.

Historically, African states have played a modest role in shaping international maritime policies. Yet the upcoming IMO vote presents a unique chance to change that.

By supporting a strong, equitable Net-Zero Framework, African countries can help steer the global transition while positioning themselves to benefit from it.

Standing together as a bloc, African nations can play a decisive role in shaping the future of global shipping.

In multilateral negotiations, coalitions are essential – they amplify the voices of developing countries and help build influence where individual states might struggle.

For example, in climate negotiations under the UNFCCC, the African Group of Negotiators has been instrumental in developing and advancing common African positions.

A similar platform may be needed for IMO negotiations to ensure that Africa’s priorities, such as technology transfer, capacity building, access to funding, fair representation, and a Just and Equitable Transition, are fully reflected.

Early, united support would send a powerful message: Africa is not waiting to be helped; it is ready to lead.

The Ports of Mombasa and Lamu serve as key gateways for Eastern Africa’s trade, while the country’s investments in wind, solar, and geothermal make it a strong candidate for future e-fuel production hubs.

Yet environmental maritime affairs have remained peripheral in Kenya’s public and policy discourse. With abundant geothermal, wind, solar, and hydro resources, Kenya holds a strategic advantage in the emerging green hydrogen economy.

The government’s Green Hydrogen Strategy and Roadmap, launched in September 2023, sets a clear course for leveraging green hydrogen as a key driver of the energy transition, starting with pilot projects in 2025.

A recent Green Hydrogen Baseline Study confirmed that Kenya has sufficient renewable energy to support large-scale hydrogen production without compromising domestic electricity supply, and identified high potential for green hydrogen to support fertiliser production and other derivatives in the short to medium term.

In this context, environmental maritime affairs must be brought into the fold. Clean shipping fuels, like green hydrogen and its derivatives, are rapidly emerging as key solutions for decarbonising global shipping.

The most important thing to take away from this first part of MEPC/ES.2 may be more subtle than explicit.
Applying the tacit procedure has been the norm of the organisation for the past 50 years when MARPOL or SOLAS have been amended.","Following the decision by IMO Member States to delay the planned adoption of the Net-Zero Framework for one year in a vote during the last day of Marine Environment Protection Committee, 2nd extraordinary session MEPC/ES.2 (14 to 17 October 2025), BIMCO expects that a member state will ask the IMO Secretary General to circulate, with a view to adopt at MEPC 84 in the spring of 2026, the three “hostage” amendments to MARPOL Annex VI bundled with the Net-Zero Framework (NZF).

As explained by BIMCO, this way, the amendments would not be left hanging in a vacuum awaiting the resumption of the MEPC/ES.2 one year from now. These are the Northeast Atlantic ECA, multi-engine operation protocols for Regulation 13 and changes to the schedule of the data collection system (DCS). These amendments are considered rather uncontroversial.

BIMCO also expects that MEPC 84 will need to deal with arranging the continuation of MEPC/ES.2. This is because the dates in the draft legal text will already need to be changed due to the delay in adoption. If the other three bundled amendments are adopted at MEPC 84, they will need to be removed from the draft legal text before the continued MEPC/ES.2. There is also the issue of figuring out what can realistically be adopted in terms of the NZF itself.

In this regard, BIMCO finds it essential that any modification of the NZF is done in such a way as to ensure that the tacit acceptance procedure is applied to its entry into force criteria once it comes to being adopted. At the time of writing, It is difficult to ascertain which modifications will be needed, but clearly, the economic element part is first in line to be reconsidered.

The most important thing to take away from this first part of MEPC/ES.2 may be more subtle than explicit. The meeting never decided on application of the explicit acceptance procedure instead of the tacit acceptance procedure. Applying the tacit procedure has been the norm of the organisation for the past 50 years when MARPOL or SOLAS have been amended.

Not taking a decision does not set a precedent. A continued well-functioning IMO is of paramount importance to the global shipping industry.

And the collapse of IMO negotiations rings as a warning about the fragility of international cooperation.","With relatively little fanfare, the first-ever global carbon tax was poised to be formally adopted as an international agreement this year.

The International Maritime Organization, or IMO, the United Nations agency overseeing global shipping, had drafted a net-zero framework to move the sector toward cleaner fuels — a crucial step in the energy transition, since the industry that handles around 90 percent of global trade also accounts for 3 percent of the world’s emissions.

The framework would require shippers to pay a fee per ton of greenhouse gas emissions if their emissions rose above a certain threshold. The fees would then be pooled into a fund and distributed to support the development and uptake of alternative fuels and decarbonization in developing countries. The shipping industry, which had been seeking a consistent regulatory environment and level playing field, was largely supportive of the plan. So were the vast majority of U.N. member countries.

Then, in April, the Trump administration abruptly withdrew from IMO negotiations. As a vote over the framework approached this month, the administration began pressuring other nations to abandon the deal. The administration also released a statement, warning that the U.S. was considering additional tariffs, visa restrictions, additional port fees, and sanctions on officials from countries that voted for the framework. President Trump himself took to Truth Social, calling the proposal a “global green new scam tax on shipping.”

The campaign succeeded. Last week, at the tail end of negotiations, Saudi Arabia abruptly called for a vote to adjourn the IMO meeting for one year without making a decision on the net-zero framework. Since IMO rules dictate that a call to adjourn precedes all other considerations, the proposed delay was voted on immediately and passed with 57 countries in favor and 49 against. (Twenty-one countries abstained from the vote.) That means that it will be another year, at least, before the framework can be officially inked.

Close observers of the IMO’s decarbonization efforts told Grist that U.S. obstruction was a decisive factor in preventing the framework’s adoption.

“It’s fair to say that the retaliatory measures and punitive threats that were shared by the U.S. administration in advance of the meetings played their part,” said Em Fenton, a senior director at Opportunity Green, a U.K.-based climate group that has been closely tracking the IMO negotiations. “The outcome last week is a devastating blow for climate multilateralism.”

The IMO has been inching toward emissions rules for several years, but the effort ramped up in 2023 when the agency’s 176 member countries agreed to a greenhouse gas strategy that would commit them to net-zero emissions by about 2050. In order to reach that goal, countries began negotiations on legally binding measures that included a standard capping the carbon-intensity of fuel used by shipping companies, as well as an economic measure to enforce that standard, which could take the form of a levy or carbon trading mechanism.

On the economic measure, countries were split. An ambitious coalition of more than 64 countries, including European Union countries, the United Kingdom, Pacific and Caribbean nations, and African countries, proposed a relatively high flat tax on all maritime emissions. Under their proposal, every ton of their greenhouse gas emissions would be priced at the same level across the board. Another set of countries led by China, however, were in favor of a carbon trading mechanism that allowed countries to offset their emissions through carbon credits. (China and other emerging economies are large exporters, and a flat fee, they argued, would hurt businesses and reduce their competitiveness.)

Ultimately, the countries landed on a compromise with a two-tier system: High emitters in the top tier could engage in some amount of carbon trading. Those in the bottom tier would pay the levy based on a fee per ton of emissions. And those who comply with the zero or near-zero emissions fuel requirements would receive financial rewards. This approach became the net-zero framework that was supposed to be voted into effect this year.

The shipping industry largely welcomed the framework. For one, the industry has had record profits in recent years. A report by Opportunity Green found that 139 of the world’s largest shipping companies, which make up more than 90 percent of the global fleet, made $340 billion in profits from 2019 to 2023. The 10 largest companies were effectively taxed at less than 10 percent on average — far lower than the average global corporation tax rate of 21.5 percent.

The industry was also eager for regulatory certainty. Ahead of the meeting last week, a group of trade organizations representing the shipping industry issued a statement calling for the adoption of the framework. “Only global rules will decarbonize a global industry,” they noted. “Without the framework, shipping would risk a growing patchwork of unilateral regulations, increasing costs without effectively contributing to decarbonization.”

With the framework now in jeopardy, the path forward is unclear. Although the shipping talks won’t resume for another year, Fenton said countries should push for additional technical clarity during other interim meetings to reach a consensus and ensure the framework is adopted next year.

Meanwhile, cities and ports across the world have been taking steps to green their infrastructure. Alisa Kreynes, a director of the ports and shipping program at C40, a global network of mayors taking climate action, pointed to various initiatives already underway to reduce carbon emissions from the shipping industry. Cities have built green shipping corridors, which are trade routes where ports and other partners work together to transition to zero or near-zero emission fuels. Ports have also begun establishing stricter emission standards for trucks, and supported the development of offshore wind.

“The way we are reacting is that cities continue to deliver a just maritime transition, despite what happened at the IMO last week,” Kreynes said. “The cities will continue to push forward with advancing equitable port and shipping decarbonization.”

But those measures won’t put a significant dent in the industry’s primary source of emissions, which is the massive, fuel-hungry boats that crisscross the globe delivering goods. And the collapse of IMO negotiations rings as a warning about the fragility of international cooperation. The dynamic could continue at COP30, the international climate conference taking place in Belém, Brazil, next month.

“The sort of playbook of delay-and-obfuscate is more likely to be on the table and visible at COP30 than it would have been if it had not prevailed here at the IMO,” said Fenton. “And that is hugely disappointing.”",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ships-barge-china.jpg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2025-10-23 05:16:50.637508

This ""China model"" not only contributes to China's energy independence but also offers ""Chinese wisdom"" and ""Chinese solutions"" for the global green transition of shipping.","On October 20, the world's first methanol-hydrogen electric dual-use container ship, the ""Yuan Chun 001,"" successfully held its maiden voyage ceremony at the Luodong Container Terminal of Shanghai Port, officially commencing commercial operations. This milestone event not only fills the gap in the application of methanol-hydrogen electric technology in the shipping sector but also marks a critical step for China in exploring full-scenario applications of liquid new energy.

Representatives from government and enterprises attending the ceremony included Liu Changman, Vice President of Shanghai International Port (Group) Co., Ltd., Wang Zhaoxing, Senior Vice President of Geely Holding Group, and Fan Xianjun, CEO of Yuan Cheng New Energy Commercial Vehicle Group. At the maiden voyage site,Shanghai International Port Group and Geely Holding Group signed a strategic cooperation agreement on green shipping, with both parties agreeing to deepen collaboration in areas such as green shipping and port intelligence. The event also showcased practical application results of technologies from Yuan Cheng New Energy Commercial Vehicle, including methanol-hydrogen and electric tractors, trucks, and marine power systems in smart port scenarios.

The green transformation of the shipping industry has become a global consensus.

According to statistics from the International Maritime Organization (IMO), the shipping industry emits approximately 1 billion mt of carbon dioxide annually, accounting for 3% of global total emissions. IMO has explicitly required ships over 5,000 mt to reduce emissions in phases, aiming for net-zero emissions by 2050. Against this backdrop,methanol energy has emerged as a key solution due to its unique advantages: it serves as a coal-based clean fuel and can be produced on a large scale by coupling hydrogen from wind and solar power with carbon dioxide emitted during coal chemical processes, enabling zero-carbon, efficient utilization of coal. It also features easy storage and convenient transportation,and has been rated by Longspur Research as ""one of the best choices for green marine fuels.""

As an international shipping hub, Shanghai is accelerating its efforts to seize the initiative in this transformation. The""Shanghai Action Plan for Promoting Green Transformation of International Shipping Fuels,""released in October 2024, proposes the establishment of a coordinated domestic and international green fuel supply system for shipping by 2030, with the initial construction of a green fuel bunkering service center. Leveraging its advantage of being the world's top container port for 15 consecutive years, Shanghai Port has taken the lead in China in deploying the entire industry chain for green marine methanol, providing a solid industrial foundation for the maiden voyage of the ""Yuan Chun 001.""

The technical performance of the ""Yuan Chun 001"" demonstrates significant competitive advantages.

The ship is equipped with a methanol-hydrogen electric system independently developed by Yuan Cheng New Energy Commercial Vehicle.Based on actual tests and comparisons: compared to traditional diesel-powered ships, energy costs are reduced by 42%, and carbon emissions are cut by 98%, nearly achieving zero-carbon operation; compared to pure electric ships, under the premise of enjoying the same national policy subsidies, the purchase cost is reduced by 24%, energy costs are lowered by 11.5%, and the driving range is increased to 1,500 km, effectively addressing the short driving range issue of pure electric vessels.

This collaboration is the result of strategic synergy between Shanghai Port Group and Geely Holding: Geely Holding has been deeply involved in the methanol field for over 20 years, establishing a comprehensive layout across the entire industry chain—from methanol production and refueling to application. In Shanghai, batches of methanol-electric vehicles have been deployed, accompanied by the construction of methanol refueling stations, and Jiading District has introduced a specialized plan to regulate the supervision of these stations. Leveraging its port operation experience and geographical advantages, Shanghai Port Group provides the necessary scenarios for technology implementation. Both parties have committed to further collaboration in advancing the establishment of green methanol standards, building refueling networks, and coordinating the capacity of methanol-electric vessels on inland waterways, accelerating the promotion of the industrial ecosystem.

The commercial validation of methanol-electric technology has achieved multi-scenario coverage.

In the road transport sector, over 50,000 methanol-electric vehicles have been deployed, accumulating a total mileage of over 23 billion kilometers, fully demonstrating their economic efficiency, safety, and reliability. Several car models under the Yuan Cheng brand have been included in the vehicle purchase tax exemption catalog. The technology has now expanded into areas such as engineering machinery and power generation units, forming a multi-dimensional green energy application matrix.

The maiden voyage of the ""Yuan Chun 001"" marks the official implementation of a three-dimensional green logistics solution based on methanol-electric technology, providing a replicable model for the transformation of the shipping industry. Wang Zhaoxing, Senior Vice President of Geely Holding Group, stated that both parties will leverage technological innovation and industrial collaboration to build a green and sustainable development model for liquid new energy.

The postponement, agreed at last week’s Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) meeting in London, is seen as a setback that could slow global climate ambition and hinder progress toward maritime decarbonisation.

Missed Opportunity for Global Climate Leadership

The NZF was expected to establish a unified global foundation for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from shipping through measures such as a fuel standard and a carbon pricing mechanism. ESPO described the delay as a missed opportunity to speed up the transition to clean fuels and warned that it could exacerbate regulatory fragmentation and unfair competition between regions.

“The postponement risks creating a standstill in global climate ambition and undermines the rare moment of convergence we have seen across the maritime sector,” ESPO stated, emphasizing that a coordinated global framework was essential for predictability and a level playing field across the supply chain.

ESPO’s Call for Continued Action in Europe

While expressing disappointment, ESPO welcomed the European Commission’s new strategy for a clean and resilient transition, which aims to boost political momentum, support green technologies, and strengthen global partnerships for sustainable value chains.

To sustain progress and encourage the use of clean fuels, ESPO urged the Commission to take tangible steps, including:

Introducing tax exemptions for electricity used by ships at berth and for zero-carbon fuels such as green methanol, ammonia, and hydrogen.

Providing subsidies and carbon contracts for difference (CCfDs) to narrow the cost gap between fossil and sustainable fuels.

Allocating EU ETS revenues to build port infrastructure for clean fuel bunkering and onshore power supply (OPS).

Creating incentives for fuel demand to encourage producers and suppliers to invest in capacity expansion.

Maintaining Momentum Despite Delay

ESPO stressed that the delay should not be mistaken for abandonment of the framework. The organisation acknowledged that the IMO’s technical work continues and urged governments, industry, and civil society to remain committed and engaged in shaping a workable and ambitious global solution.

Meanwhile, ESPO called on the European Commission to address the unintended side effects of regional regulations, such as business leakage and reduced competitiveness of European ports, until a global alignment is achieved.

Reaffirming its commitment to climate action, ESPO called on the European Commission, EU Member States, and maritime stakeholders to keep pressing for a strong global regulatory framework under the IMO. “Only through robust, coordinated global regulation can international shipping remain on a credible path toward net-zero emissions,” ESPO concluded.

Wasaline said the route is ""the world's first green shipping corridor in operation"", cutting the carbon emissions that cause dangerous climate change.
""We are currently operating with biogas and HVO (hydrotreated vegetable oil), so we are operating completely carbon neutral,"" Teir said.
The global shipping industry, which transports nearly 90 percent of the world's cargo and still relies heavily on fossil fuels, is responsible for around two to three percent of global greenhouse gas emissions each year.
""The EU already has its system in place, while China is signalling plans for its own programs, adding complexity to global shipping,"" he told AFP in an email.","In Finland, one of the world's first large passenger ferries to go carbon neutral aims to set the global standard for sustainable shipping, even as efforts to slash the industry's emissions face a backlash.

No smoke billowed from the stacks of the Aurora Botnia, a 150-meter (492-foot) cargo and passenger ferry that can transport around 900 people, as it quietly crossed the narrow Gulf of Bothnia from Vaasa in Finland to Umea in Sweden, the world's northernmost year-round shipping and passenger traffic route.

The hybrid ferry runs partly on batteries and in August, its liquified natural gas (LNG) was replaced with biofuels, making it one of the world's first larger carbon-neutral ferries, operator Wasaline's technical director Jonas Teir told AFP as he gave a tour of the engine room.

Wasaline said the route is ""the world's first green shipping corridor in operation"", cutting the carbon emissions that cause dangerous climate change.

""We are currently operating with biogas and HVO (hydrotreated vegetable oil), so we are operating completely carbon neutral,"" Teir said.

""We are also installing more battery capacity which will reduce the need for fuel and other resources for energy,"" he said, explaining that more battery power would increase capacity from today's 2.2 MWh to 12.6 MWh.

That will make it the largest marine battery hybrid system in operation globally.

New European Union rules on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and increasing renewable and low-emission fuels in the maritime sector came into force this year.

Member states of the International Maritime Organization were also set to formally adopt the Net Zero Framework -- the first global carbon-pricing system -- on October 17, but the vote was postponed by a year after the United States opposed the carbon-cutting plan and threatened to impose sanctions against countries backing it.

The global shipping industry, which transports nearly 90 percent of the world's cargo and still relies heavily on fossil fuels, is responsible for around two to three percent of global greenhouse gas emissions each year.

- Pooling carbon deficit -

Wasaline benefited from its collaboration with several large nearby tech and energy companies keen to test out their cutting edge emission-reduction technology on the vessel, ""a win-win situation for all parties involved"", Teir said.

""We are one of the smaller shipping companies in the world, so being a forerunner is also something that sets a little bit of a benchmark for the bigger ones,"" he added.

Because the ferry has met EU climate targets, it can use a new EU mechanism allowing it to sell the carbon emissions it ""saved"" to another shipping company, which can then mark it down as its own emission reduction.

""The pooling mechanism makes it economically viable to run 100 percent on biofuels,"" Teir said.

Fanny Devaux, deputy director of shipping at European NGO Transport & Environment, said Aurora Botnia demonstrated ""real progress in energy efficiency and electrification"".

But the shipping industry needs to steer away from biofuels, she said.

""There just isn't enough sustainable biowaste to power all the ships in the world.""

""The ultimate goal must be to replace fossil fuels with scalable fuels that can achieve deep, verifiable emission reductions without harming ecosystems,"" she said, citing e-fuels such as e-methanol, e-ammonia, and hydrogen made from renewable electricity.

Reducing energy consumption ""through operational and technical efficiency"" remained the most important rule in the energy transition, Devaux stressed.

Docking in the small Swedish port of Umea where the open sea glittered, still ice-free in October, captain Johannes Sjoholm said it felt like he was ""part of something bigger"" by ""challenging the old systems"".

""We hope to be a kind of pilot project for others to see and notice that it is possible to do this this way,"" he said.

- Constraints -

According to Hakan Agnevall, CEO of ship engine builder Wartsila, the postponed IMO vote ""opens the door to a fragmented landscape of carbon pricing mechanisms introduced by individual regions and countries"".

""The EU already has its system in place, while China is signalling plans for its own programs, adding complexity to global shipping,"" he told AFP in an email.

Devaux said the postponed vote ""introduces significant uncertainty for the shipping industry and clean tech investors"".

Wartsila is currently developing new engines for more climate-friendly fuels and energy efficient technology.

""We actually have the technologies. But getting a sufficient amount of fuels, making the whole equation financially viable, those are the biggest constraints right now,"" he said.

The NZF had been in the works for several years and had gained wide consensus before IMO’s recent decision. The decision creates considerable uncertainty in the sector, coming amid intense U.S. opposition that appears unlikely to wane, and the MEPC continues to pursue adoption of the NZF.

Key Takeaways

The MEPC deferred a decision to make the NZF legally binding until October 2026

The U.S. vehemently opposed adoption of the NZF, threatening to impose trade, port, and other restrictions on countries supporting the measure

The MEPC will continue work to define fundamental elements of the NZF and achieve consensus on its adoption

European Union (EU) measures regulating shipping GHG emissions will remain in place, and other countries may consider similar measures

The IMO decision creates considerable regulatory uncertainty for stakeholders across the shipping supply chain, and they should prepare to engage policymakers on several fronts

Background

The NZF would establish a legally binding regulatory framework to achieve net-zero GHG emissions ""by or around, i.e. close to, 2050,"" as articulated in the 2023 IMO Strategy on Reduction of GHG Emissions from Ships, agreed by the MEPC in July 2023. If adopted, the NZF would be included as a new chapter 5 in Annex VI to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL).

The NZF combines a global fuel standard and GHG emissions pricing mechanism applicable to ships over 5,000 gross tonnage. The scheme endorsed by the MEPC in April creates two tiers of GHG fuel intensity (GFI) targets, a Base Target (BT) and a more stringent Direct Compliance Target (DCT). In simplified terms, ships that fail to meet the targets generate ""compliance deficits"" and would be required to acquire Remedial Units (RUs), while ships that exceed the DCT could generate bankable Surplus Units (SUs). RUs would be acquired by making ""pricing contributions"" to a yet-to-be-established IMO Net-Zero Fund. Ships that use ""Zero or Near-Zero GHG emission technologies, fuels and/or energy sources"" (ZNZs) would be eligible to receive ""Rewards"" (annual compensation) from the IMO Net-Zero Fund.

Recent IMO Actions

The MEPC approved the text of the NZF at its 83rd meeting in April (MEPC 83) and had targeted formal approval needed to make it legally binding at its extraordinary session held last week (October 14-17). However, support for the NZF weakened in the intervening months amid U.S. threats of trade and other retaliation measures against countries supporting the measure. The MEPC ultimately adopted a resolution to adjourn the ES until October 2026 without approving the NZF.

In a statement issued after the extraordinary session, the MEPC affirmed its intention to continue work on developing NZF implementation guidelines to further define fundamental aspects of the scheme and achieve consensus on adopting the measure. Work to develop these guidelines is already beginning at this week's meeting of the Intersessional Working Group on the Reduction of Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Ships.

The U.S. first signaled its ""unequivocal"" opposition to the NZF on April 9, 2025, when it announced its withdrawal from MEPC 83, urging other governments to ""reconsider"" their support for the agreement and warning it could consider ""reciprocal measures."" The U.S. escalated these threats in a joint statement issued August 12, 2025, by the U.S. Departments of State, Transportation, Energy, and Commerce, and ultimately detailed retaliatory measures it planned to consider in a policy statement issued on the eve of last week's MEPC ES, including targeted port access and visa restrictions, sanctions, penalties, and port fees. The U.S. has made clear its intent to ""levy these remedies against nations that sponsor this European-led neocolonial export of global climate regulations.""

IMO adoption of the NZF would have triggered a process to consider changes to European Union (EU) measures regulating shipping GHGs - the Emissions Trading System (ETS) (Directive (EU) 2023/959) and FuelEU Maritime regulation (Regulation (EU) 2023/1805). The decision to postpone consideration of the NZF means these measures remain intact and, more broadly, that the shipping industry will continue to face a patchwork of regional and/or country-specific regulations governing GHG emissions and maritime fuel.

What’s Next

Going forward, ship owners, charterers, and other supply-chain stakeholders, including fuel suppliers and ship builders, should monitor developments closely and engage on multiple fronts, including:

IMO/MEPC efforts to achieve consensus on the NZF, which could require negotiating significant changes, likely with significant U.S. input;

IMO/MEPC efforts to better define key elements of the NZF through implementation guidelines to be developed by IMO bodies in the coming months;

U.S. efforts to gain leverage over NZF negotiations through a variety of trade or punitive measures; and

Efforts in other regions and countries, including the EU, to develop and/implement measures to regulate GHG emissions from ships that visit their ports.

Finally, companies in other sectors should note that the Trump administration's approach to the NZF mirrors its broader pattern of leveraging international environmental disputes to advance domestic industrial priorities and leverage bilateral trade. As such, companies affected by other international schemes, such as the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), should consider how the Trump administration's approach to the NZF may inform its approach to these schemes.",https://www.bdlaw.com/content/themes/beveridge-theme/img/og-default.jpg,N,,2025-10-22 22:20:35.512541

The report, which was undertaken by SMM, a major international maritime trade fair set to take place in Hamburg next year, found that high energy costs and increasing regulatory burden are among the top issues for maritime firms, with the shortage of skilled professionals at the top of this list.

Data-driven solutions are much in demand across the industry, growing in importance by 13% compared to the previous year, with interest in artificial intelligence solutions soaring, SMM noted.

Shipowners also said that they are increasingly likely to order new ships for their fleet, with 48% saying they were either ‘likely’ or ‘very likely’ to do so, compared to 46% in 2023 and 39% in 2021.

The findings were published ahead of the IMO’s recent announcement that it will adjourn its decision on sustainable maritime fuels for one year.

Market expectations

The SMM Maritime Industry Report evaluated market participants’ expectations regarding the development of the shipping and shipbuilding segments, with the Maritime Industry Score measuring the difference between positive and negative expectations on a scale of -100 to +100.

The overall Maritime Industry Score stood at 50.5 points, indicating overall market optimism despite seeing a slight decline from 2023.

Of the key segments of the industry, shipyards registered the strongest confidence at 49.9 points, the highest level since the survey began, while suppliers remained at a high level of 64.6 points and shipowners stood at 34.4, which was ‘slightly more moderate’ than in previous surveys.

Volatile environment

“The volatile global political environment, marked by numerous conflicts which have a direct impact on the maritime world, is clearly leaving its mark,” commented Dr. Klaus Borgschulte, shipyard manager and chairman of the SMM Advisory Committee.

As well as sustainability, suppliers are seeing a sharpened focus on after-sales service and product longevity, the study found, with Hauke Schlegel, CEO at VDMA Marine Equipment and Systems noting that “quality is becoming the most important success factor.”

Our analysis indicates that the trading price of surplus units will likely be governed by market dynamics rather than biofuel cost premiums.","The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has decided to postpone the adoption of its Net-Zero Framework (NZF) for another year. This delay, while creating additional uncertainty, warrant careful examination of the proposed mechanisms. Prior to the IMO MEPC meeting, in-depth research by Rystad Energy 's maritime decarbonization specialists revealed critical gaps in the current NZF that would to be addressed to ensure an equitable and sustainable transition for the global shipping industry. The delay will now give member states time to refine ambiguous or contentious elements to produce a stronger, more implementable framework.

The research revealed a substantial disparity between projected clean-fuel availability and targeted demand, exacerbated by infrastructure constraints, which raises concerns about the feasibility of the prescribed transition timeline. Furthermore, the study exposed a persistent imbalance in the carbon-trading mechanism, with demand for Tier II remedial unit offsets expected to outstrip available surplus units through 2035. This structural deficit is anticipated to drive trading prices towards the Tier II penalty ceiling.

The research also underscores the need for careful consideration in designing the reward mechanism to prevent it from becoming a mere penalty-collection system. While the cost gap is expected to narrow as technology matures and economies of scale are achieved, a well-designed reward mechanism is crucial to incentivize sustainable practices. By addressing these critical issues, the IMO can develop a more effective and equitable NZF, ultimately supporting the global shipping industry's transition to a low-carbon future.

Decarbonizing the maritime sector is a complex challenge that goes beyond shipping, closely tied to the global shift from fossil fuels to renewables. Our findings suggests progress will likely lag behind the IMO’s current expectations due to infrastructure limits, technology readiness, and energy system interconnections. While the industry is committed, practical constraints demand a realistic approach. The IMO should use the extra year to refine the NZF into a more practical and equitable framework.

For more on the future of green shipping, listen to the recent Let’s Talk Energy episode: Shipping has a plan to go green, but will it work?

Rystad Energy recently published a detailed investigation into the NZF and its financial implications for the shipping industry's decarbonization journey. Download the report here.

The analysis leveraged our extensive cross-sector data assets, from conventional fuels to hydrogen derivatives and biofuels, alongside a comprehensive analysis of alternative-fuel fleet composition, port infrastructure and global shipyard capabilities.

Under the NZF, vessels that meet the direct target may generate Surplus Units (SUs), while non-compliant vessels will generate Remedial Units (RUs). Remedial Units are categorized in two tiers: Tier I (RU1s) for vessels that meet the base target, and Tier II (RU2s) for those that do not.

Non-compliant vessels may offset their Tier II Remedial Units by acquiring Surplus Units from compliant vessels.

Key findings from Rystad Energy’s research reveal a complex interplay between SUs and RUs within the framework. Initial projections show SUs starting at 40 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent in 2028, growing to 53 million tonnes by 2035. Simultaneously, RU2s are expected to increase significantly from 47 million tonnes to 234 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent annually by 2035. The availability ratio between the SUs and RU2s will effectively set the market-clearing price for exchanges, with Rystad Energy’s projections suggesting that demand for RU2 offsets will consistently outstrip SU supply until 2035. This supply-demand imbalance will likely drive SU trading prices close to the Tier II penalty threshold.

Our analysis indicates that the trading price of surplus units will likely be governed by market dynamics rather than biofuel cost premiums. Given the limited availability of advanced biofuels for shipping, we anticipate that SU prices will approach the Tier II penalty level of $380 per tonne of CO2 equivalent, minus transaction costs.

Junlin Yu, vice president of supply chain research, Rystad Energy

While surplus units will substantially offset Tier II penalties through 2030, this mechanism could inadvertently limit the financial incentives available for early adopters of zero-emission technologies. The real turning point comes in 2031, when surplus units become increasingly scarce, compliance requirements tighten, and shipping companies face growing emission deficits. This will trigger a sharp escalation in penalty collections, substantially boosting the Net-Zero Fund's capacity to support the industry's decarbonization efforts.

The research highlights potential challenges in the framework's design, particularly the two-year limit on banking surplus units to avoid dilution of future emission-reduction efforts, which could potentially dampen early adoption of clean technologies. This constraint stands in stark contrast to the FuelEU Maritime regulation's permanent banking allowance.

Financial projections indicate substantial growth in the IMO Net-Zero Fund, with combined Tier I and Tier II penalties expected to generate approximately $13 billion in 2028, escalating to nearly $79 billion by 2035. However, our analysis raises concerns about the framework's effectiveness in supporting the transition to zero-emission vessels, particularly in its early years.

Rystad Energy's analysis estimates the potential reward level and benchmarks it against the required reward level, which is the threshold necessary to equalize the effective costs of e-fuels and conventional fuel oil. Initially, the required reward level is substantial due to the significant cost premium associated with e-fuels, resulting in a shortfall in cost compensation from the net-zero fund until 2030, even if 100% of the fund's resources are allocated to rewards. However, as technological advancements drive cost reductions, learning effects take hold, and economies of scale are achieved, the required reward level is expected to decrease over time, ultimately yielding a substantial surplus in the fund after the required reward.

Our findings suggest that even with 100% fund allocation toward rewards, the mechanism may not adequately compensate for the cost premium of zero or near-zero emission fuels (ZNZs) until 2030. However, beyond 2030, a substantial surplus is expected to emerge in the fund, driven by the initially low uptake of ZNZs. This underscores the critical importance of carefully designing the reward mechanism to ensure it effectively catalyzes the industry's transition toward zero-emission shipping. The fund should be used to drive meaningful emissions reductions, rather than accumulating a large surplus.

Conclusion: A Critical Juncture for Global Shipping The IMO’s decision to delay its Net-Zero Framework represents more than a temporary setback—it signals a potentially dangerous stagnation in global shipping’s decarbonization efforts.","10/22/2025

The global shipping industry faces deepening uncertainty after the International Maritime Organization postponed a crucial decision on its Net-Zero Framework, creating what industry leaders describe as “decision-making paralysis” at a pivotal moment for the sector’s decarbonization.

The regulatory delay, forced through by United States opposition despite earlier approval, threatens to derail shipping’s energy transition and undermines the investment certainty that shipowners require to commit billions toward cleaner vessels and fuels. This development comes as data reveals a significant slowdown in orders for dual-fuel vessels, highlighting the tangible consequences of regulatory instability.

Key Developments: The IMO’s Delayed Decision

In an extraordinary session this October, IMO member states voted to postpone the adoption of a global emissions pricing mechanism and fuel standards that had been scheduled to take effect in 2027. The decision represents a dramatic reversal from earlier in the year when the same measures received overwhelming support.

The postponement follows what participants described as an “unprecedented campaign” against the measures, with U.S. officials accused of pressuring other countries with threats of tariffs, penalties, and visa restrictions. This opposition created a new alliance including Russia, Saudi Arabia, and other petrostates, successfully delaying the implementation until at least 2028.

IMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez expressed disappointment with the fractious nature of the discussions, stating: “It is the time to really look back at how we have approached this meeting. My plea to you is not to repeat the way we have approached this meeting for future discussions.”

Industry Impact: Decision Paralysis Sets In

The regulatory uncertainty comes at a critical juncture for maritime decarbonization. According to industry analysis, fragmented regulation is undermining progress in decarbonization and limiting investment. The report warns that without sufficient regulatory support, the global shipping industry risks falling short of its net-zero targets.

Investment Hesitation: “What’s happening right now when we meet with our customers? We see for ourselves uncertainty and uncertainty causes inaction and lack of investment,” said Lasse Krisoffersen, CEO of car carrier Wallenius Wilhelmsen.

Regulatory Volatility: Ibrahim Al Nadhairi, CEO of Asyad Shipping Company, echoed these concerns: “We wake up every morning, there’s a new regulation”. This sentiment reflects the industry’s struggle to navigate an increasingly complex and unpredictable regulatory landscape.

The consequences are tangible: data from the first ten months of 2025 shows a marked plateau in orders for dual-fuel newbuildings, as shipowners hesitate to commit to significant capital expenditures without clear regulatory signals.

The Green Fuel Challenge: Availability and Cost

Compounding the regulatory uncertainty are fundamental concerns about alternative fuel supply chains and infrastructure:

Table: Alternative Fuel Cost Comparison

The significant cost premium for green fuels creates a chicken-and-egg dilemma: shipowners are reluctant to invest in vessels without guaranteed fuel supply at viable prices, while fuel producers hesitate to scale production without sufficient vessel demand.

“The availability of alternative fuels is still limited, and the infrastructure for their production, storage, and distribution is underdeveloped,” notes a recent industry study, highlighting the interconnected challenges facing the industry.

Broader Pressures: Geopolitics and Economic Headwinds

The shipping industry’s decarbonization challenges are further complicated by wider economic and geopolitical pressures:

Trade Policy Volatility: Shifting trade policies, including recent U.S. tariff announcements, are “constantly shifting” and “very difficult to keep up with,” resulting in higher costs for businesses.

Aging Fleet Concerns: The average age of the tanker fleet is increasing, with some industry leaders warning of “graveyards of floating environmental bombs” due to older vessels often lacking proper classification and insurance.

Growth Slowdown: Global maritime trade growth is projected to stall in 2025, a sharp decline from 2024, further tightening industry finances.

Path Forward: Navigating the Uncertainty

Despite the setbacks, some industry players are moving forward with transition strategies:

Targeted Retrofitting: Research suggests that “long-term compliance and financial performance are best achieved through targeted retrofitting supported by carbon taxes and favourable market conditions”.

Fuel-Agnostic Approaches: Some operators are considering more flexible strategies that maintain options across multiple potential fuel pathways rather than committing to single solutions.

Regional Compliance: With the EU’s Emissions Trading System already covering shipping and FuelEU Maritime rules in force, operators trading in European waters must navigate existing regulations despite global uncertainty.

Conclusion: A Critical Juncture for Global Shipping

The IMO’s decision to delay its Net-Zero Framework represents more than a temporary setback—it signals a potentially dangerous stagnation in global shipping’s decarbonization efforts. As one climate minister stated after the vote: “This is unacceptable given the urgency we face in light of accelerating climate change”.

With shipping emissions projected to rise significantly without intervention, the industry stands at a crossroads. The coming year will be critical in determining whether global cooperation can prevail over national interests to provide the regulatory clarity needed to navigate toward a sustainable future.

As one industry representative summarized: “The industry has demonstrated its commitment to change, but the reality is that without regulatory clarity and global alignment, investment and innovation will remain hesitant”.

The proposed NZF aims to reduce global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the shipping industry by combining mandatory yearly emissions limits with penalties for failure to meet the set limits. NZF contains provisions requiring all oceangoing ships over 5,000 GT to reduce their annual GHG fuel intensity (GFI) from 2028. The GFI is calculated using a well-to-wake approach, measuring emissions from fuel production through to actual use onboard. If a ship emits below a certain threshold or fully switches to zero or near-zero emission fuels, it qualifies for financial rewards. If ships exceed the agreed emission levels, this will trigger CO2 levies.

The NZF is proposed to be included in a new Chapter 5 of Annex VI to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL). The regulations are expected to enter into force 16 months after the formal adoption, at which point governments will be responsible for enforcing them.

Had the framework been adopted in October 2025 as originally planned, entry into force would have been around March 2027, with the first reduction requirements applying from 2028. The postponement now creates uncertainty as to when the NZF will take effect and whether it will be subject to substantial amendments.

The NZF, even in a possible, amended form, represents a fundamental shift in maritime regulation, and early preparation will be key to ensuring compliance and maintaining competitive advantage.

There are only two operational CCUS projects in the global iron and steel sector, which are delivering minimal capture rates.","Bill Hare is CEO and senior scientist with Climate Analytics.

The term “hard-to-abate” is widely claimed by heavy industry like the iron and steel sector to argue against having to reduce emissions quickly, or to justify their continued faith in carbon capture utilisation and storage (CCUS) – or offsets – to meet climate goals.

But continuing to classify highly polluting industrial sectors as “hard-to-abate” is jeopardising the world’s ability to achieve global net-zero CO2 emissions by around mid-century, critical to the Paris Agreement goal of limiting warming to 1.5C.

In a recent report, we have taken a forensic look at the iron and steel (and cement) sectors, showing how the “hard-to-abate” label has shaped both policy and industrial actions in ways that risk undermining the urgency and effectiveness of global climate mitigation efforts.

The iron and steel sector accounts for 7-8% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Technologies for achieving zero emissions in steel production are currently available at commercial scale, with strong policy support.

Yet this sector has convinced governments that it cannot mitigate its emissions without CCS – as evidenced by the recent German government announcement that sets aside €6 billion ($7 billion) to deal with hard-to-abate sectors like steel, which includes inviting proposals for CCS projects.

Iron and steel emissions are currently projected to be just 10% lower in 2050. Yet, in top-down scenarios that limit warming to 1.5C – such as the International Energy Agency’s Net Zero Emissions roadmap – combined CO2 emissions for iron and steel fall by about 23% by 2030 below 2023 levels, 46% by 2035 and 94% by 2050.

Existing tech and demand reduction can cut emissions

Steel is produced by one of three different methods. Nearly three-quarters of the world’s steel is still produced with the highly polluting “blast furnace to basic oxygen furnace” (BF-BOF). Here, coal is turned into coke at high temperatures to provide the carbon monoxide required to turn iron ore into iron. Coal typically also powers the furnace, where the steelmaking occurs. All stages of this process produce CO2.

The second is “direct reduced iron to electric arc furnace” (DRI-EAF) where iron ore is reduced in a direct reduction furnace in a solid state using a reduction gas such as hydrogen or syngas (often derived from fossil fuels). As the name implies, electric arc furnaces are powered by electricity, so there’s a choice of electricity generation sources.

Lastly, there’s scrap steel recycling in Electric Arc Furnaces (EAF), which can also be entirely powered by renewables.

This sector, we find, could feasibly reach near-zero residual CO2 emissions by around 2050 based on currently available technologies. If complemented by strong demand-side interventions without large-scale CCUS, this sector could potentially eliminate the need for negative CO2 emissions.

Carbon colonialism? Malaysia and Indonesia plan storage hubs for Asian emissions

Demand reduction measures, such as increased use of secondary steel and improving material efficiency, could reduce steel requirements by up to 20% by 2050, making deep decarbonisation even more achievable. Substantial emissions reductions could be achieved through circular economy strategies that reduce steel demand, such as cutting the ‘overspecification’ of steel in construction, which could lower steel use by 35–45%.

Advanced retrofitting of existing plants could also help limit warming to 1.5C. Substitution of green hydrogen and, only where necessary, CCUS, could lead to large reductions of up to 66% of cumulative emissions from this sector between 2020-2050, compared to estimated emissions levels without any interventions.

CCUS not working for industry

Industry recourse to future CCUS deployment and offsets must also be put in the context of doubts about the legitimate mitigation potential of these pathways. Because despite its frequent promotion, CCUS deployment in supposed hard-to-abate sectors – or indeed any sector – remains minimal for emissions abatement purposes.

Reliance on CCUS poses substantial technical, economic and scalability risks. It cannot capture 100% of emissions; residual emissions are inevitable.

The combined announced capacity for CCUS projects that are operating, planned or under construction in the steel sector is only 9 million tonnes of CO2 a year. This is just 0.3% of the total 2.6 billion tonnes of CO2 the steel sector emitted in 2022.

There are only two operational CCUS projects in the global iron and steel sector, which are delivering minimal capture rates. Aside from these, there are only 11 planned projects and one (two-stage) project under construction. This is compared to the more than 1,000 steel plants operating or under development globally.

Offsets, by design, allow CO2 emissions to occur that would not otherwise have occurred in their absence and often lack additionality, permanence and verifiability, thus failing to deliver real mitigation.

Together, CCUS and offsets allow companies to delay investment in transformative solutions. Strong policy and regulation should instead consider treating sectors like iron and steel as typical sectors with 1.5C-compatible emissions reduction obligations, reducing dependence on negative emissions by mid-century.",https://www.climatechangenews.com/wp-content/files/2025/10/GERMANY-Steel-works-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-22 17:16:34.872077

IMO Delays Key Climate Decision for Shipping

London 17th October 2025 – A scheduled Extraordinary Session of the IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee has ended without adopting the policy measures agreed upon in principle in April 2025. These measures are intended to reduce emissions from the shipping sector and kick-start the sector’s energy transition.

The meeting failed to complete the next milestone toward the entry into force of the “Net Zero Framework”. In the decision taken at the end of the week, a vote was called for by Saudi Arabia to adjourn the meeting for one year. The vote resulted in 57 countries accepting the motion, forming a majority of those present and voting, and the meeting was subsequently adjourned.

Dr Tristan Smith, Professor of Energy and Transport at UCL Energy Institute Shipping & Oceans Research Group said: “This is catastrophic for confidence, and therefore also for the equitable and ambitious decarbonisation we need. We will now have to double-down on other means to drive shipping GHG reduction and energy transition. Climate science tells us that the challenge of decarbonisation does not go away, it gets harder. This delay therefore means those with the means must step up and lead more than ever, until this multilateral process can regain its composure.”

A vote was also called at the MEPC 83 meeting in April 2025, agreeing in principle to the legal amendment to MARPOL Annex VI. A number of countries changed their positions relative to that vote, providing evidence that well-publicised threats from the United States, including tariffs and reprisals for any country that supported the Framework, and related pressure, were effective at changing positions. On this occasion, that pressure appears to have been effective.

US Pressure Delays IMO’s Net Zero Progress

Dr Annika Frosch, Research Fellow at UCL Energy Institute Shipping & Oceans Research Group said: “The adoption of the Net Zero Framework by the IMO would have marked a crucial step forward for shipping decarbonization. Although adoption has been postponed, the process remains underway, with key technical guidelines now the focus before potential adoption in 2026.”

The decision on the IMO’s Net Zero Framework does not override or change the foundation of the GHG Reduction Strategy that was adopted at MEPC 80 in 2023. This unanimously adopted strategy commits the organisation to absolute GHG emission reductions of 20-30% in 2030 and 70-80% in 2040, on a pathway to reaching net-zero emissions by/around 2050. As long as that is the stated strategy, the IMO should in theory make progress toward adopting regulations in line with it. However the outcome at IMO means further work on regional and national regulation of international shipping has now been vindicated, making current regulations such as those in EU likely to be prolonged. We could now see more regions taking similar action.

Dr Pinar Langer, Research Fellow at UCL Energy Institute Shipping & Oceans Research Group said: “This unexpected delay highlights both the complexity and the high stakes of reaching global alignment on shipping’s net-zero transition. The year ahead offers a vital window for constructive engagement and for strengthening the evidence base to ensure that when the framework is finally adopted, it is both equitable and actionable across diverse national contexts.”

Even with the outcome to defer the conclusion of the current adoption of the NZF, work on the underpinning guidelines can continue, with next week’s meeting (Intersessional Working Group 20th session) going ahead as planned. These guidelines will specify important details on definitions, calculations, and methods for determining how the policy incentivises and evaluates different technology and fuel options needed for decarbonisation, how the fund will be set up and run, and how its key parameters will be revised on an ongoing basis.

The IMO's Net-Zero Framework, designed to drive global shipping toward net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, has been delayed by one year. The decision came after intense negotiations failed to reach consensus, with the next opportunity for adoption set for late 2026. This postponement extends uncertainty for the maritime sector and may slow investment in green shipping technologies.

Market & Policy

Shipping accounts for nearly 3% of global CO₂ emissions and carries about 90% of world trade. The IMO’s proposed framework includes a global fuel standard and a greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions pricing mechanism. While broadly supported by industry and many governments, the framework faced opposition from key states, notably the United States and Saudi Arabia, who argued that a global carbon price could harm fuel producers and developing economies. The delay raises the risk of a patchwork of regional regulations, such as the EU’s inclusion of shipping in its Emissions Trading System, potentially undermining a level playing field. The IMO will continue technical negotiations, aiming to resolve concerns about fairness, revenue use, and implementation processes.

Technology & Innovation

The Net-Zero Framework is intended to accelerate adoption of alternative fuels, cleaner vessels, and carbon pricing in shipping. Technical work continues on guidelines for calculating fuel lifecycle emissions, structuring carbon credit trading, and supporting a just transition for developing countries. The delay may slow deployment of new technologies, as shipowners hesitate to invest amid regulatory uncertainty.

Funding & Projects

Industry leaders, including major shipowners and port authorities, have called for clear global rules to de-risk investments in green fuels and infrastructure. The delay may postpone large-scale funding decisions, but some regions, notably the EU, plan to proceed with their own measures. Stakeholders urge continued investment in pilot projects and R&D to maintain momentum.

Risks & Constraints

The main risks are regulatory fragmentation and delayed climate action. Without a global framework, shipping companies may face inconsistent requirements across regions, increasing compliance costs and complexity. Political divisions—especially over carbon pricing and support for developing nations—remain significant barriers. The earliest the framework could enter into force is now March 2028, assuming adoption in 2026.

Outlook

The coming year will be critical. The IMO’s working groups will seek to bridge gaps on financial impacts, revenue distribution, and procedural issues. Industry and regional regulators are encouraged to maintain progress and avoid a “wait-and-see” approach. If consensus is reached in 2026, the shipping sector could still achieve a unified, ambitious decarbonization pathway. For now, the sector faces a longer road to regulatory certainty and climate alignment.",https://thecurrentsource.net/og-image.jpg,N,,2025-10-22 18:00:20.512131

Members of the IMO initially voted in April to approve the net-zero framework and a carbon tax, agreeing to charge shipping companies for greenhouse gas emissions from their vessels if they exceed a certain threshold. However, the Trump administration’s effort now delays the vote by one full year.

“Last week’s IMO is a pivot point in this whole climate nonsense. We’re going to come back to the realistic views of energy, and President Trump is just all in on American energy dominance. That’s a win, not just for America. That’s a win for the world,” Wright added.

Delaying a vote on the IMO’s carbon tax marks another win for the Trump administration’s efforts to influence international climate policy. The Department of Energy on Wednesday stepped up its pressure on global climate action, sending a letter to the European Union regarding its corporate sustainability rules.

TRUMP SAYS US WON’T COMPLY WITH PROPOSED CARBON TAX ON SHIPPING INDUSTRY

The Energy Department, along with Qatar, sent a letter to the EU urging members to roll back the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD). The U.S. and Qatar argued that the rule would disrupt the trade in liquefied natural gas to Europe.

The rule requires firms operating in the EU to address human rights and environmental issues throughout their operations and supply chains. For non-compliant companies, the EU will impose a fine of up to 5%.

“[T]he CSDDD, as it is worded today, poses a significant risk to the affordability and reliability of critical energy supplies for households and businesses across Europe and an existential threat to the future growth, competitiveness, and resilience of the EU’s industrial economy,” the letter reads.","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP25287656740595.jpg?resize=1024,683",N,,2025-10-22 15:16:28.325772

In the immortal worlds of Billy Ocean, and someone at the AEA conference this week, when the going gets tough…","Quantum Commodity Intelligence - Friday's IMO announcement that CO2 emissions in the shipping industry are not likely to be taxed in 2027, proved to be only a mild damper on the mood at the Ammonia Energy Association annual meeting being held in Houston this week.

As the conference opened on Monday, the elephant in the room — the International Maritime Organization's (IMO) decision on Friday not to vote on the introduction of the Net-Zero Framework — was swiftly acknowledged by participants.

Once that was out the way, participants at the conference refocused on company collaboration and regional policies to maintain clean ammonia momentum, even if international carbon policy for the marine sector remains unclear.

Importance of partnerships

Global government policy has proven to be predictably unreliable for the clean energy space. This is leading companies to rely on collaborations within the private sector to develop further the technology, feasibility, funding, and certification for the low-carbon ammonia sector.

By the end of day two of the conference, it was clear just how much progress has been made in the clean ammonia space, regarding ammonia's potential role as a fuel in shipping and power generation, and as a carrier for the hydrogen economy. Despite delays to CO2 tariff implementation, and setbacks in power sector auctions, the industry is powering through.

Partnering in projects has proved the lifeline for the clean ammonia industry. And collaborations were highlighted during the conference, as panels discussed the CF Industries, JERA, and Mitsui's Blue Point project in Louisiana, cooperation between technology firms on marine engines, and companies teaming up on improving ammonia cracker performance.

With the conference based in Houston this year, there was also considerable interest from both small and major industry participants, vying for partnerships for blue ammonia projects in the US to secure 45Q carbon credit incentives.

Industry resilience

Scaling up clean ammonia demand and technology remained at the forefront of the conference agenda. Despite near-term setbacks, the sector is proving to be resilient, and is continually finding ways to keep momentum going. The AEA event highlighted technology advancements this week, particularly with regards to nitrous oxide emissions.

A few years ago, little work had been done on addressing NOx and N2O concerns linked to burning ammonia as a fuel, but these had to be quickly addressed as ammonia combustion tests began a few years ago, and the emissions became evident.

At the time, some said NOx emissions from ammonia fuel could signal the end to efforts to make it a viable fuel alternative. But within two years, the industry has responded, and companies this week showcased technologies that have been developed to reduce emissions from ammonia engines, making it a safe and viable fuel alternative once again.

Create the demand

Possibly as a response to lack of clear regulatory direction from the maritime sector, there was also considerable focus on ammonia's potential as a hydrogen carrier during the AEA conference this week.

One of the major issues facing the clean ammonia sector over the last year has been the lack of firm offtake demand for the product due to cost sensitivities. Developers looking to supply hydrogen using ammonia as a carrier, are looking to develop the demand side of this sector. Having seen the pitfalls of bringing supply onstream before there is a ready market, some developers are choosing to focus on the creating demand first and worrying about supply later.

""We came to London in reluctant support of the IMO's Net Zero Framework,"" he explained.
Industry seeks regulatory certainty The shipping industry had broadly supported the framework as it would provide consistent global standards for investment planning.","A landmark agreement to decarbonise global shipping has been postponed for at least a year after the International Maritime Organisation voted to delay adoption of its Net Zero Framework.

The motion to adjourn passed by a narrow margin on 17 October, with delegates from more than a hundred countries voting at the Marine Environment Protection Committee's extraordinary session in London.

In total, 57 delegates voted in favour of adjournment and 49 voted against it, while 21 abstained entirely.

The outcome represents a significant setback for what would have been the world's first internationally mandated emissions reduction targets for the shipping industry.

The deal, which was initially agreed in principle in April after a decade of negotiations, included several measures to encourage sustainable shipping, including introducing fines for any companies that did not at least start to use low-carbon fuels by 2028.

How the US used trade to influence voters

The delay followed intensive lobbying from the US administration, which had threatened countries with tariffs if they supported the framework.

US President Donald Trump called the plan a ""green scam"" in a post on Truth Social, declaring the US would not tolerate ""increased prices on American Consumers"". Back in the US, Secretary of State Marco Rubio went on to describe the postponement as a ""huge win"" for Trump's government.

Delegations from developing countries reported what they described as ""bullying"" and ""unprecedented"" pressure from Washington, with threats of sanctions alongside tariff warnings.

Even some island nations – which are at particular threat from rising sea levels – abstained from voting, leading to the lengthy adjournment.

The Bahamas and Antigua & Barbuda, both of which agreed to the deal's terms in April, were two countries that abstained.

A delegate from the island states group subsequently told the BBC that these nations particularly rely on the US for trade and had been leaned on heavily by the Trump administration to change their position.

Saudi Arabia's role in the collapsed talks

Saudi Arabia brought the motion to adjourn to a vote on the final day of talks, when countries were scheduled to approve the framework.

The chairman of the negotiations confirmed that this meant the agreement was not approved, as key timelines for the treaty would require revision.

Ralph Regenvanu, Minister for Climate Change for the Republic of Vanuatu, said that Saudi Arabia's motion was ""unacceptable given the urgency we face in light of accelerating climate change"".

Mr. Regenvanu, who has been a vocal advocate for climate justice in recent years, saw the bill as imperfect but far better than a future without a framework.

""We came to London in reluctant support of the IMO's Net Zero Framework,"" he explained. ""While it lacks the ambition that climate science demands, it does mark a significant step.""

China, which had initially supported the deal in April, also agreed to the delay.

What the framework would have achieved

The Net Zero Framework would have required ship owners to use increasingly cleaner fuels from 2028 or face financial penalties. The mechanism would apply to vessels over 5,000 gross tonnes, establishing a market-based system of credits and penalties.

Ships exceeding emission limits would need to purchase remedial units, whilst low-emission vessels could earn and trade surplus credits.

Revenue would flow into an IMO Net-Zero Fund intended to support clean fuel adoption and assist developing countries with the transition.

Shipping currently accounts for 3% of global emissions, with 90% of all goods transported by sea. Without intervention, the IMO previously estimated emissions could grow between 10% and 150% by 2050.

Industry seeks regulatory certainty

The shipping industry had broadly supported the framework as it would provide consistent global standards for investment planning.

Thomas Kazakos, Secretary-General of the International Chamber of Shipping, said: ""We are disappointed that member states have not been able to agree a way forward at this meeting.""

Thomas added: ""Industry needs clarity to be able to make the investments.""

IMO Secretary General Arsenio Dominguez issued a closing plea following the vote, stating: ""As we come to an end my plea to you is not to repeat the way we have approached this meeting in other discussions for future discussions.""

Arsenio urged delegates to use the year to ""negotiate and talk and come to consensus"" before reconvening in 2026.

The UK and most EU nations voted to continue the talks, though Greece abstained contrary to the broader EU position.

Blánaid Sheeran, policy officer at environmental NGO Opportunity Green, warned: ""A delay in action may require changes to the text of agreement that undermine the planned timeline, and could revert years of work to date.""",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/5dac8d3461678e86d99bbee38615c779:6d76bad764c9f92b6bbcd83a32ffed85/graphics-for-work-65.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-10-22 11:20:41.107313

Major energy and commodity traders, whose shipping operations often carry large carbon footprints, are now investing in cleaner and more efficient shipping. With the International Maritime Organization (IMO) calling for a 40% reduction in shipping’s carbon intensity by 2030 from 2008 levels, these players are now deploying new methods to cut emissions at sea. Retrofitting old vessels or even order state-of-the-art tankers with clean fuel capacity, energy traders are emerging as unexpected champions of green shipping.

Take BGN International, for example. The Geneva-base private commodity trader recently begun modernizing its fleet by adding advanced gas carriers with an eye on emissions reduction. In 2023, the company took delivery of two Very Large Gas Carriers (VLGCs) equipped with modern hull designs to minimize drag along with dual-fuel engines that can run on lower-carbon fuels. This year the firm, in partnership with UAE-based Al Seer Marine, welcomed a third new VLGC named Merak, which can carry ammonia cargo and operate on both traditional and alternative fuels. “This state-of-the-art vessel... underlines our commitment to contributing to industry-wide decarbonization efforts,” BGN CEO Rüya Bayegan said upon Merak’s delivery. The company now boasts one of the largest VLGC fleets in its sector. As a result, it now also has a range of carrier sizes that can operate in both underserved markets with undeveloped infrastructure, and modern markets with advanced ports. These appear to be a strong steps to align with IMO’s decarbonization goals.

Energy traders are also squeezing better performance out of existing vessels. Take Vitol, one of the world’s largest traders that operates a substantial shipping fleet. The Dutch-based company has been conducting an extensive retrofit program since 2022 to curb emissions from its vessels. Hulls are being cleared of biofouling and coated with high-end anti-fouling paint, and ships are being fitted with energy-saving devices like pre-swirl stators and propeller caps with fins to improve propulsion efficiency. These measures yield fuel savings of roughly 6% - a significant gain in an industry where incremental efficiency translates to big emissions and cost cuts. Vitol says its fleet is on track to meet the IMO’s 2030 emission-reduction target years ahead of schedule.

Traders are making bold bets on next-generation shipping technology. Trafigura, like BGN and others, is looking to ammonia as a zero carbon option to power ships in the future. In May 2025, Trafigura placed an order at Hyundai Mipo shipyard for four medium-sized gas carriers designed with dual-fuel engines that can run on ammonia. Each 190-meter vessel will be able to carry 45,000 cubic meters of liquefied gas and use ammonia as bunker fuel, with special systems to ensure safe handling of the corrosive, toxic fuel. This first-of-its-kind fleet won’t hit the water until 2028, but the company sees it as a critical step toward maritime decarbonization. “[This project] supports our commitments to decarbonising shipping and will help develop the global low-carbon ammonia bunkering infrastructure needed for zero-carbon shipping to become a reality,” says Andrea Olivi, Trafigura’s Head of Wet Freight. The initiative is part of a broader industry partnership that involves a host of maritime experts, engine makers, and port authorities to test and prove ammonia’s viability as a marine fuel.

The push by energy companies to reduce maritime emissions complements efforts by shipowners, shipbuilders, and regulators to do the same. Industry veterans observe that no single player can decarbonize shipping alone - it requires coordination across fuel suppliers, vessel operators, technologists, and financiers. Cross-industry collaboration will be key to shaping the future, as BGN’s shipping unit noted after a recent decarbonization forum. Indeed, many of these green vessel initiatives involve partnerships to properly reduce scope 1 and 2 emissions: BGN’s joint venture with Al Seer Marine, Gunvor’s with Solvang, and Trafigura’s multi-party ammonia fuel project all underscore the power of collaboration. Banks appear particularly excited about the growing trend. Middle Eastern lenders recently financed newbuild gas carriers, citing contribution to “sustainable development and innovation in the maritime sector” and its alignment with “decarbonization efforts in the marine industry”.

As global shipping navigates toward stricter carbon targets, the engagement of energy traders is a welcome tailwind. These companies are leveraging their deep financial networks and market knowledge to today’s fleet efficiency to piloting tomorrow’s fuel technologies. The result is a maritime ecosystem that is gradually but steadily trimming its carbon sails. By investing in greener ships and practices, energy firms are burnishing their sustainability credentials whilst also helping to propel the entire industry into an era of lower emissions and smarter shipping. The course is set for a lower carbon horizon.

This decision is particularly disappointing given the strong calls from across the shipping sector for a unified global approach.
Incentivising the demand for clean fuels, taking away the uncertainty and making it more attractive for fuel producers and suppliers to invest and step up capacity.
The global maritime community must stay engaged and committed to shaping a framework that is both ambitious and workable.
Awaiting a possible alignment between EU and future IMO regulations, market distortions that undermine the strength of European ports should be recognised and addressed.","The European Sea Ports Organisation (ESPO) has expressed serious concern over the International Maritime Organisation’s (IMO) decision to postpone the adoption of the Net-Zero Framework (NZF) by one year.

The delay, decided during last week’s Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) meeting in London, risks creating a standstill in global climate ambition and lowering the pace of progress in maritime decarbonisation.

The NZF was expected to establish a global regulatory foundation for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from shipping, including a fuel standard and a pricing mechanism. ESPO considers this postponement a missed opportunity to accelerate the sector’s transition to clean fuels and fears it will further prolong the fragmentation and unlevel playing field stemming from regional regulations.

This decision is particularly disappointing given the strong calls from across the shipping sector for a unified global approach. The momentum was there, with broad support for a framework that could provide clarity, predictability, and a level playing field for all actors in the maritime supply chain. The postponement risks undermining this rare moment of convergence and weakens the credibility of international climate leadership in shipping.

Despite this setback, ESPO welcomes the European Commission’s new strategy to shape a global clean and resilient transition, which aims to inject political momentum into climate action, support clean tech industries, and expand global partnerships for sustainable value chains.

To maintain progress and incentivise the uptake of clean fuels, ESPO calls on the Commission to take concrete actions, including:

Introducing targeted tax exemptions for electricity used by ships at berth and for zero-carbon fuels such as green methanol, ammonia, and hydrogen, to reduce operating costs and stimulate demand.

Incentivising the demand for clean fuels, taking away the uncertainty and making it more attractive for fuel producers and suppliers to invest and step up capacity.

The postponement should not be interpreted as a cancellation. ESPO acknowledges that the IMO’s technical work on developing guidelines and implementation pathways is still ongoing. ESPO urges all stakeholders—governments, industry, and civil society—not to lose faith in the process and to continue contributing constructively. The global maritime community must stay engaged and committed to shaping a framework that is both ambitious and workable.

Moreover, in the provisional absence of a breakthrough at global level, Europe’s ports ask the Commission to effectively address the negative impacts of the EU regional approach measures on business leakage and competitiveness. Awaiting a possible alignment between EU and future IMO regulations, market distortions that undermine the strength of European ports should be recognised and addressed.

ESPO finally also calls on the Commission, EU Member States, and the maritime stakeholders to continue pushing for robust global regulation under the IMO, ensuring that international shipping remains on a credible path toward net-zero emissions.",https://m.psecn.photoshelter.com/img-get/I00007RWZV3kKofk/s/848/I00007RWZV3kKofk.jpg,N,,2025-10-22 11:20:53.471862

The US had already rejected the draft terms on reducing the industry’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in August, describing the framework as a “global carbon tax on Americans levied by an unaccountable UN organisation”.

During crucial talks to approve the deal held last week (October 17), Singapore and Saudi Arabia led on a proposal to adjourn the talks for a year, which garnered votes from the US and Russia.

A total of 57 countries voted in favour of the delay, while 49 voted against, and 21 abstained.

The delay “reduces the likelihood of passing the previously agreed proposal”, warned Rico Luman, senior economist, transport and logistics at Dutch bank ING.

In its current guise, the framework would bring in a set of “mid-term measures” that include targets for reducing ships’ annual GHG fuel intensity and penalties for ships that emit more than this.

“While the delay provides additional time to build consensus – also within different shipping segments – momentum appears to be fading, making agreement increasingly difficult,” Luman said.

“Continued procrastination could ultimately lead to cancellation, which would be a disappointing outcome.”

If the framework had been approved this month, the measures would have come into force in 2027, but the delay means implementation will now be pushed back to 2028 at the earliest.

Jennifer Cornejo, partner at law firm Vinson & Elkins, added: “Because the net zero framework had certain milestones, the pause almost certainly forces revisions to those compliance timelines and could reopen debates on certain aspects, such that the package next voted on is narrower in some ways.”

The delay could also result in a “patchwork of regional regimes” that might lead to increased compliance costs and an uncertain regulatory or investment environment, she said.

Ahead of the meeting last week, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, and Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy said in a joint statement that the Trump administration “unequivocally rejects this proposal”.

“The economic impacts from this measure could be disastrous, with some estimates forecasting global shipping costs increasing as much as 10% or more,” the statement said.

It laid out several steps the US could take against countries that support the net-zero framework, including blocking vessels from US ports and imposing new regulation and extra visa restrictions, as well as commercial penalties via government contracts.

Emma Fenton, senior director of climate diplomacy at climate change NGO Opportunity Green, called the outcome a “devastating indictment of member states’ lack of courage to stand in solidarity with climate vulnerable countries to achieve a just and equitable maritime transition”.

“Faced with pressure, too many governments chose political compromise over climate justice, and in doing so, abandoned the countries bearing the brunt of the climate crisis.”

Yet, some say the delay could offer an opportunity to review weaknesses in the mechanisms proposed in the net-zero framework.

Norwegian energy consultancy Rystad Energy found “critical gaps” in the current framework between the projected availability of green fuel and the targeted demand, “which raises concerns about the feasibility of the prescribed transition timeline”.

“Our findings suggest progress will likely lag behind the IMO’s current expectations due to infrastructure limits, technology readiness and energy system interconnections,” said Junlin Yu, vice president of supply chain research at Rystad Energy.

“The IMO should use the extra year to refine the net zero framework into a more practical and equitable framework.”

If ships exceed their targets for GHG emissions, they can transfer surplus units from other vessels, use units they have previously banked if they have outperformed the targets, or pay penalties in the form of buying “remedial” units.

Rystad Energy’s projections also suggest that demand for remedial units will outstrip surplus unit supply until 2035.

If the price of surplus units is governed by market dynamics rather than cost premiums for greener fuel, this could limit the incentives for zero-emission technologies, according to Rystad Energy.

ING’s Luman also pointed out that the shipping sector’s projected CO₂ reductions by 2030 fall short of earlier ambitions, meaning that the IMO’s 2040 and 2050 targets are becoming “increasingly challenging”.

In 2023, the IMO agreed to target a 20% reduction in total annual emissions by 2030 compared to 2008 levels and a 70% reduction in total emissions by 2040.

Net zero is set to be achieved “by or around” 2050, to allow for “different national circumstances”.",https://www.gtreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Cargo-ship-smoke-exhaust_News.jpg,N,,2025-10-22 08:20:27.044293

The Trump administration had expressed strong opposition to the pact and threatened retaliatory action if it was approved.

IMO members met this month to vote on whether to formally adopt the “Net-Zero Framework” of fuel standards for ships. Under this framework ships would have to reduce their annual GHG fuel intensity over time, with ships emitting above certain thresholds required to acquire remedial units to balance their deficit emissions and those using zero or near-zero GHG technologies eligible for financial rewards. These measures, which had been expected to enter into force in 2027, would be mandatory for oceangoing ships over 5,000 gross tonnage, which the IMO said emit 85 percent of the total CO2 emissions from international shipping.

However, earlier this year the Trump administration claimed that this framework “is effectively a global carbon tax on Americans levied by an unaccountable UN organization” that “would conveniently benefit China by requiring the use of expensive fuels unavailable at global scale.” It would also “preclude the use of proven technologies that fuel global shipping fleets, including lower emissions options where U.S. industry leads such as liquified natural gas (LNG) and biofuels” and instead would require ships to “pay fees for failing to meet unattainable fuel standards and emissions targets.”

At that time the White House warned other IMO members that the U.S. “will look for their support against this action and not hesitate to retaliate or explore remedies for our citizens should this endeavor fail.” Such retaliation could include tariffs, visa restrictions, and/or port levies.

While the IMO did convene a meeting this month to consider adopting the agreement, on Oct. 17 a majority of members at that meeting voted to adjourn it and reconvene in 12 months.

Global shipping must stay on a credible path toward net-zero emissions.”","The European Sea Ports Organisation (ESPO) has expressed deep concern over the International Maritime Organisation’s (IMO) decision to delay the adoption of the Net-Zero Framework (NZF) by one year. The decision, made during last week’s Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) meeting in London, risks slowing global climate action in shipping.

The NZF was set to provide a global roadmap to cut greenhouse gas emissions from shipping through a fuel standard and pricing mechanism. ESPO calls the delay a missed opportunity to speed up the transition to clean fuels. The organisation warns that continued fragmentation between regional and global rules will harm competitiveness and create uncertainty.

The postponement is especially disappointing given the broad industry support for a unified global approach. “Momentum was building,” ESPO said. “The sector needs clarity and predictability, not another year of waiting.” The delay weakens confidence in the IMO’s climate leadership and risks losing the rare alignment among governments, shipowners, and ports.

Despite the setback, ESPO welcomes the European Commission’s new strategy for a clean and resilient transition. The plan aims to boost clean-tech industries, expand global partnerships, and keep climate action on track.

To maintain progress, ESPO urges the Commission to take practical steps now:

Grant tax exemptions for onshore electricity and zero-carbon fuels like green methanol, ammonia, and hydrogen.

Support clean fuel adoption through subsidies and carbon contracts for difference (CCfDs).

Use EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) revenues to fund port infrastructure for clean fuel bunkering and onshore power supply (OPS).

Incentivise fuel demand to encourage investment in production and supply capacity.

ESPO stresses that postponement must not mean loss of ambition. The IMO’s technical work continues, and all stakeholders, governments, industry, and civil society, should stay engaged. “We must keep pushing for a strong, workable global framework,” ESPO urged.

In the meantime, ESPO asks the European Commission to address negative impacts of the EU’s regional measures on competitiveness. Until global alignment is achieved, Europe must act to prevent market distortions and protect the strength of its ports.

ESPO concludes: “Europe must keep leading. The IMO delay should strengthen our resolve, not weaken it. Global shipping must stay on a credible path toward net-zero emissions.”",https://container-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/william-william-NndKt2kF1L4-unsplash-1-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-10-22 08:20:51.403186

More than 100 countries had gathered in London on 17 October to approve the IMO Net-Zero Framework, which had been agreed in April after 10 years of negotiations. Had it passed, it would have seen shipping become the first industry to adopt internationally mandated targets to reduce emissions.

But the decision has been delayed after a motion tabled by Saudi Arabia to adjourn talks for a year passed narrowly.

Shipping currently makes up 3% of global emissions. The regulation – spearheaded by UN agency the International Maritime Organization – would require ships to gradually reduce the amount of greenhouse gas emitted for each unit of energy used across their fuel’s lifecycle.

To encourage the industry to comply with this global fuel standard, the regulation includes a pricing mechanism, with set prices for the greenhouse gases ships emit.

In the run up to the meeting, representatives of the Trump administration had threatened countries with tariffs and other economic penalties had they voted for the deal, which it said would lead to price rises for consumers.

The US and Russia voted in favour of Saudi Arabia’s motion to delay the talks, as did several countries that had initially agreed to the deal in April, including China and the Bahamas. Greece, Cyprus, and Antigua and Barbuda, which had also previously agreed to the treaty, were among those that chose to abstain from the vote.

Those in favour of the framework say the delay will allow its opponents to drum up support to kill it.

Celebration and disappointment

US secretary of state Marco Rubio declared the outcome a “huge win” for president Donald Trump, who had called the framework a “green scam” and said he was “outraged” by the effort to bring in the regulation.

European Commission executive vice president Teresa Ribera called the delay “a huge shame”, while Ralph Regenvanu, minister for climate change for Vanuatu – an island nation in the South Pacific which is particularly vulnerable to climate change – said Saudi Arabia’s motion was “unacceptable given the urgency we face in light of accelerating climate change”.

“We came to London in reluctant support of the IMO’s Net-Zero Framework. While it lacks the ambition that climate science demands, it does mark a significant step,” he said.

He said there had been “relentless pressure” from the US for countries to back its position.

MEPC ES.2 Opening Remark - Mr. Arsenio Dominguez on 14 October 2025.

The Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC)—a body within the International Maritime Organization (IMO) responsible for addressing environmental issues including regulating and preventing ship-source pollution under the MARPOL treaty—convened an extraordinary session from October 14-17. The session was held to debate draft amendments to MARPOL Annex VI, including the IMO Net-Zero Framework, which was previously approved in principle at MEPC 83 earlier this year.

After several days of intense negotiations without a consensus, the Committee decided late on Friday to adjourn the final adoption of the framework for one year. A total of 57 countries were in favor of the delay; 49 countries were against it, and there were 21 abstentions.

MEPC 83 – Setting ambition

At MEPC 83 in April, Member States endorsed the IMO Net-Zero Framework. This was a landmark step toward achieving the Organization’s goal of net-zero GHG emissions from international shipping by 2050. Sixty-three countries voted yes, versus sixteen that were in opposition. The Framework introduces, for the first time, mandatory global greenhouse-gas (GHG) limits alongside an emission-pricing mechanism. This decision marked a fundamental shift in how the sector will manage its carbon footprint.

While the initiative received broad support as a necessary step for global alignment, several critical design elements remain unresolved, including:

Default emission factors and lifecycle accounting for fuels;

Certification schemes for sustainable and zero-emission fuels;

Infrastructure for a central compliance registry;

Pricing and governance for post-2030 “remedial units”.

Despite criticism of under-ambitious targets, compared to the Organization’s long-term net-zero objective by 2050, the IMO NZF is a vital first step towards monetizing maritime emissions. The gap reflects a familiar challenge of multilateralism — consensus often yields the lowest common denominator.

MEPC ES.2 - Negotiation and delay

The second extraordinary session addressed several key agenda items, including:

Review of the IMO Data Collection System (DCS) and access to emissions data.

Short-term evaluation of existing GHG reduction measures.

Establishment of a North Atlantic Emission Control Area (NOx, SOx, PM).

Consideration of the Net-Zero Framework (NZF).

The NZF dominated the session. It is the first attempt to introduce a global emissions-pricing model for shipping — a measure intended to send a clear market signal and unlock investment in low-emission fuels, new builds, and retrofits. Without such clarity, the industry’s decarbonization financing remains uncertain.

Following the decision to adjourn adoption by one year, the framework is targeted to come into force in 2028, consistent with the first reporting period. The vote does not alter the formal timeline, but it underscores the difficulty of turning consensus into implementation. As the meeting reminded delegates, global rulemaking is never straightforward: agreement does not mean readiness.

Still, the Intersessional Working Group on the Reduction of Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Ships (ISWG-GHG), scheduled from Oct. 20-24, will proceed to continue working on the implementation guidelines for the Net Zero Framework.

Multilateral Dynamics

Three broad camps emerged during the debate:

Proactive coalition – Advocating decisive collective action and stronger measures, including the EU (except Greece, Malta, and Cyprus), Brazil, and Pacific Island nations;

Cautious supporters – Endorsing the framework’s objectives but calling for more time to clarify details and ensure equitable outcomes;

Opponents – Rejecting the principle of a global pricing mechanism altogether, led by the United States and Saudi Arabia.

This alignment highlights both the strength and fragility of multilateralism: while nearly all maritime nations share the same table, diverging interests often paralyze progress. It also exposes diverging interests that can paralyze progress. The challenge ahead is to avoid further polarization within the IMO, where the ambition to reinforce global governance could instead deepen divides.

The Regional Complexity

As global negotiations stall, regional initiatives may gain further momentum. The European Union’s ETS and FuelEU Maritime frameworks have already set the pace for carbon pricing and fuel standards. Continued delays could prompt other regions to explore independent carbon mechanisms.

If the IMO fails to deliver a credible mechanism, the risk of regulatory fragmentation — with overlapping and inconsistent carbon regimes — will increase, undermining the global level playing field the NZF was meant to secure.

The Way forward

The delay represents a setback for those seeking investment certainty and a unified decarbonization pathway. Yet, it can be viewed from two angles:

The optimist’s view: an extra year provides an opportunity to strengthen the framework, refine its mechanisms, and build broader support around a fair and effective solution.

The realist’s view: the industry may simply not be ready, and achieving consensus next year could prove even more difficult.

Many fuel producers, shipbuilders, and cargo owners have said they need reassurance that shipping is, in fact, charting a cleaner course before they invest billions of dollars in making new fuels and building related infrastructure.
“There is a lack of incentive globally for shipping operators to use clean fuels,” said Jade Patterson, an analyst for the research firm BloombergNEF.
In the meantime, the industry will continue guzzling greater volumes of fossil fuels as shipping activity grows over time.
How clean those fuels actually are depends largely on whether the hydrogen is produced using renewables, or the way that most H2 is made today: with fossil fuels.","This summer, an ammonia-powered ship completed its maiden voyage in eastern China, becoming the first of its kind to run purely on the carbonless compound. Around the same time, in Denmark, the shipping giant Maersk launched a big container ship that can use methanol, making it the fourteenth and largest vessel yet in the company’s growing low-carbon fleet.

Efforts like these are playing out worldwide as the maritime industry works to replace dirty diesel fuel in oceangoing ships, which haul everything from T-shirts and tropical fruit to solar panels, smartphones, and steel rebar. But the progress to date has been piecemeal, representing only a sliver of the world’s oil-guzzling freighters and tankers.

Up until last week, the United Nations’ International Maritime Organization appeared on the cusp of approving a strategy to supercharge shipping decarbonization worldwide. The plan was set in motion in 2015, after the U.N. adopted the Paris Agreement, clarifying the urgent need for countries and companies to reduce planet-warming pollution to zero.

“It sent a signal for the [maritime] industry to start thinking ahead,” said Narayan Subramanian, an expert on international climate policy and clean energy finance at Columbia Climate School.

In the ensuing decade, the IMO worked to hash out regulations that could jumpstart a universal transition toward cleaner ships. The agency landed on the Net-Zero Framework, which would require ships to use more low-carbon fuels and also establish a tax on carbon emissions — setting the first binding carbon-pricing scheme for an entire industry.

“This is not coming out of left field. It’s not being imposed overnight,” Subramanian said last week before IMO officials put the framework to a vote.

Yet on Oct. 17, after a full-throttle offensive from the Trump administration, the IMO moved to delay making any decision on the landmark decarbonization strategy by one year, keeping the industry locked in limbo. Many fuel producers, shipbuilders, and cargo owners have said they need reassurance that shipping is, in fact, charting a cleaner course before they invest billions of dollars in making new fuels and building related infrastructure.

“There is a lack of incentive globally for shipping operators to use clean fuels,” said Jade Patterson, an analyst for the research firm BloombergNEF. He said the framework would improve the business case for using hydrogen-based fuels like ammonia and methanol, which are significantly more expensive than oil- and gas-based fuels.

A smaller group of IMO members is meeting in London this week to drill down on the finer details of the proposed regulations, which will come up for a vote again in October 2026. But it’s unclear whether any global environmental agreement can succeed while President Donald Trump is in office.

In the meantime, the industry will continue guzzling greater volumes of fossil fuels as shipping activity grows over time.

Slashing CO2 from dirty ships

Tens of thousands of merchant ships ply the oceans every year to haul roughly 11 billion metric tons of goods. Together, they’re responsible for about 3% of the world’s annual greenhouse gas emissions.

The Net-Zero Framework was meant to give teeth to the nonbinding climate goals that IMO adopted in 2023. Member countries set near-term targets for reducing cargo-ship emissions by at least 20% by 2030, compared to 2008 levels. They also called for curbing emissions by at least 70% by 2040, and for reaching net-zero emissions ​“by or around” 2050.

Countries further agreed to have 5% to 10% of shipping’s energy use come from zero- or near-zero-emissions fuels and technologies by 2030.

Current adoption of those fuels amounts to a tiny droplet in an ocean’s worth of oil. Much of it is driven by voluntary efforts by companies like Maersk, which face pressure from investors and customers to clean up their fleets. Meanwhile, regional environmental policies are taking effect. European nations and China are working to rein in ship-engine pollution, and they and other countries — including Brazil, India, and, until recently, the United States — are steering government funding into hydrogen production.

Hydrogen is a key component of ammonia and methanol — two common chemicals that can be used in engines or fuel cells. How clean those fuels actually are depends largely on whether the hydrogen is produced using renewables, or the way that most H2 is made today: with fossil fuels. Renewable diesel, another lower-carbon option for powering vessels, also uses hydrogen in its production process.

If every project to produce green ammonia, green methanol, and renewable diesel comes online as planned, and if the fuels only go toward powering ships — not airplanes or vehicles or to other uses — they would make up less than 20% of global shipping’s fuel needs in 2030, which are expected to reach 290 million metric tons that year, Patterson said.

Those are two enormous ​“ifs.” Many of the announced fuel projects are facing serious headwinds, including high inflation, soaring production costs, and the Trump administration’s steep tariffs and clean-energy funding cuts. IMO’s recent decision to punt on its net-zero vote only deepens those challenges.

Last year, Danish energy giant Ørsted canceled plans to build a green-methanol plant in Sweden, citing weaker-than-expected interest from the maritime sector. Another Ørsted methanol project in Texas is facing uncertainty after the U.S. Department of Energy in May revoked an award of up to $99 million for the facility, as part of sweeping cuts to the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations. In the Netherlands last month, Shell said it is abandoning construction on a biofuels plant in Rotterdam owing to the fuel’s lack of competitiveness.

“What we’ve seen is that this lack of demand and the shift in policy has led many projects to fold,” said Ingrid Irigoyen, president and CEO of the Zero Emission Maritime Buyers Alliance. ​“But that’s not because they weren’t good projects. These are good fuels that we need, and which are vastly scalable.”

The buyers alliance is a nonprofit group of about 50 multinational companies that helps negotiate clean-fuel contracts — including for waste-based biomethane — between producers, vessel operators, and firms that put their goods on ships. Irigoyen said such voluntary initiatives are meant to be a ​“catalyst” that helps to scale production and bring down costs of alternative fuels, not the sole engine of shipping decarbonization.

“We can’t do it alone,” she added.

Even as shipping-industry groups and climate experts push for a global policy, there’s still widespread disagreement about how the framework should work in practice. Environmental groups oppose including crop-based biofuels, like soy and palm oil, given that their production can lead to forest loss and increase overall emissions. Policy analysts note that the ripple effects of higher fuel costs and carbon taxes across supply chains could disproportionately affect small and developing economies.

As IMO members navigate those questions, shipbuilders and owners are holding their breath for the answers.

This year, the number of new orders for alternative-fueled vessels has markedly declined compared to last year as companies adopt a ​“wait and see” approach, according to Jason Stefanatos, global decarbonization director at DNV.

In September, the advisory firm recorded no fresh orders for ships capable of running on methanol or ammonia, though nearly 360 methanol ships and nearly 40 ammonia ships are on the books through 2030.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/GettyImages-2110570779.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=f8ad6e1c8d83e60897ae6e9ff7324983,N,,2025-10-22 04:16:28.689840

Shipping emissions, though global in origin, intensify these local threats by accelerating climate instability.
These efforts, though modest in scale, illustrate a recognition that Africa cannot afford to wait for global consensus to secure its maritime future.","The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has postponed the long-awaited adoption of its Net-Zero Framework, an ambitious plan meant to steer global shipping toward carbon neutrality, after the United States threatened economic retaliation against countries supporting the measure. The decision, made in London after tense negotiations among 176 member states, halts what was shaping up to be one of the most transformative policy shifts in maritime regulation. For Africa, whose trade arteries pulse through maritime routes, this delay reverberates far beyond the docks, touching the continent’s economic, environmental, and developmental ambitions.

The framework, initially endorsed by a majority of nations in April 2025, was designed to cap and progressively reduce greenhouse gas emissions from ships, which currently account for about 3% of global emissions, roughly equal to Germany’s annual output. Left unchecked, maritime emissions are projected to double by 2050, eroding global climate gains and placing vulnerable coastal regions, many in Africa, at heightened risk from rising sea levels and erratic weather patterns. The IMO plan proposed a global fuel standard, a carbon pricing system, and a Net-Zero Fund to reward low-emission vessels and finance green maritime infrastructure in developing countries.

What seemed like a clear path to decarbonization was derailed by geopolitics. The United States government’s return to Washington’s helm has brought a sharp reversal of U.S. climate diplomacy. Citing the framework as “anti-competitive” and “burdensome to American consumers,” the U.S. threatened punitive actions against supporting states, including sanctions, higher port fees for their flagged vessels, and even visa restrictions for their maritime officials.

Facing that pressure, 57 nations, led by Singapore and backed by Saudi Arabia, voted to delay the agreement for another year, while 49 opposed and 21 abstained. The hesitation underscores a familiar pattern: global climate ambition often collapses at the intersection of politics and profit.

In Africa, where 90% of trade by volume moves by sea, the implications are profound. The continent’s economies are acutely tied to maritime logistics; whether it’s Nigerian crude, Kenyan tea, or South African minerals. Yet Africa’s ports and shipping fleets remain among the least modernized and most carbon-intensive globally. According to the African Development Bank, fewer than 10% of African ports currently have the capacity to handle alternative fuels like green ammonia or methanol.

The IMO framework, with its promised financial support for clean technology transfer, could have positioned African nations to modernize fleets, upgrade port infrastructure, and create new green jobs across logistics chains. Its postponement therefore stalls not only a climate milestone but also an opportunity for Africa to participate in the trillion-dollar decarbonization economy.

Consider Durban, one of Africa’s busiest ports. Its annual throughput of over 2.8 million containers makes it a critical node in regional trade, yet its emissions profile is largely shaped by heavy fuel oil and outdated cargo handling systems. The city’s ongoing adaptation efforts, such as electrifying dock cranes and investing in LNG bunkering, represent early attempts at sustainability, but without global regulatory clarity, financing such initiatives becomes precarious.

A similar challenge faces Mombasa, which handles 1,700 ships annually and serves as East Africa’s maritime gateway. Kenya’s nascent plans to introduce low-sulphur fuel facilities could have received critical funding through the IMO’s Net-Zero Fund; now, those investments hang in limbo.

The suspension also threatens Africa’s voice in shaping the rules of future shipping. Many African countries, including Ghana, Egypt, and Seychelles, had aligned with the pro-framework bloc, viewing it as a vehicle for equity in global trade. The framework’s design included explicit provisions for a “just transition”, financial support for developing states to adapt without compromising competitiveness. The delay effectively sidelines these nations, reinforcing structural inequities that leave African ports reliant on outdated fleets even as global shipping giants, such as Maersk and MSC, accelerate their own private decarbonization projects.

The Danish shipping conglomerate Maersk, among the loudest critics of the delay, described the move as “a loss of momentum for the industry’s efforts to decarbonize.” Its first methanol-powered container ship began operations this year, signaling a shift among major players toward cleaner fuels. Yet without universal rules, the risk of a fragmented regulatory landscape grows. Wealthier states may adopt regional carbon schemes, like the European Union’s Emissions Trading System extension to shipping, while developing nations lag behind, facing potential trade penalties for non-compliance. This could mean higher freight costs for Africa, restricted access to certain ports, and growing inequality in maritime competitiveness.

The broader environmental consequences are no less severe. Africa’s 30,000-kilometer coastline already bears the brunt of rising seas and coastal erosion. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates that a one-meter sea level rise could displace over 40 million Africans by mid-century. Shipping emissions, though global in origin, intensify these local threats by accelerating climate instability. By deferring collective action, the IMO has effectively extended the continent’s exposure to both environmental and economic volatility.

Amidst the disappointment, there are still signs of resilience. Several African states are pressing ahead with regional initiatives: Morocco is developing a green hydrogen corridor with the EU; Namibia is constructing an ammonia export hub; and Egypt has begun pilot programs to retrofit ships with solar-hybrid propulsion systems on the Suez Canal. These efforts, though modest in scale, illustrate a recognition that Africa cannot afford to wait for global consensus to secure its maritime future.

Ultimately, the postponement of the IMO Net-Zero Framework underscores a larger truth about sustainability in the developing world: progress is rarely linear, and global politics often dictate the pace of change. The challenge posed for Africa now is to harness this delay not as defeat, but as a catalyst, to prepare its ports, fleets, and policies for the inevitable transition ahead. Because when the framework eventually returns to the table, the continent’s readiness, or lack thereof, will determine whether it rides the next wave of green trade, or is once again left at its mercy.",https://africasustainabilitymatters.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/The-true-cost-that-we-are-paying-to-ship-all-of-our-junk-across-the-ocean.jpeg,N,,2025-10-22 03:16:29.418987

The decision means that the proposed regulation will not come into force as originally scheduled in March 2027.

The IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) met in London on 14–17 October 2025. The extraordinary session of the Committee was to reach a final decision on globally binding Net-Zero Framework to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from shipping.

However, its adoption was postponed by at least one year. In the decisive vote, 57 IMO Member States supported the postponement, while 49 countries, including Finland, voted against it. A further 21 Member States abstained.

According to the jointly agreed EU policy, Finland was in favour of adopting global regulation at this session. Finland finds that this global emission reduction measure would have evened out the imbalance in international regulation of maritime emissions and levelled out the competitive environment, between the EU and the rest of the world, for business and industry that depend on shipping. Without globally coordinated action, the emission reduction targets set by the IMO cannot be met.

The goal of the IMO is to reach carbon neutrality in maritime transport by or around 2050 in a way that considers national circumstances. By 2030, greenhouse gas emissions from ships must be reduced by at least 20 per cent compared to 2008. The interim target set for 2040 is a reduction of at least 70 per cent.

What’s next?

The outcome of the session represents a setback both for efforts to reduce emissions from maritime transport and for the future of multilateral cooperation between states. The decision leaves the shipping industry without a global economic policy instrument or fuel standard that would be legally binding, both of which are considered crucial for the demand for more sustainable fuels and propulsion technologies.

The future of negotiations within the IMO on this matter remains uncertain. It is not yet clear what the starting point for further discussions will be. However, negotiations on certain technical guidelines specifying the proposed regulation package are expected to continue this week at the working group level.

Who knew that owners were so concerned about the poor consumer? A bemused and a little amused Arsenio Dominguez Secretary General of the IMO, sat in the front row of the Cyprus Maritime Conference in Limassol, pointed out that the UN body has many opinions and these were not the only shipowner opinions.

That much was apparent as only one of the five panellists, Semiramis Paliou, CEO at Diana Shipping, dissented from the majority panel view.

She was the only woman on stage with four giants of Greek shipping, such as John Coustas of Danaos and Thanassis Martinos of Eastern Mediterranean, George Procopiou, chairman of Dynacom Tankers, and Andreas Hadjiyannis, CEO of Cyprus Sea Lines and Hellenic Tankers. Was it any wonder she admitted to “feeling a little intimidated.”

Procopiou had opened the panel discussion claiming that the IMO’s climate regulations were a kolotoumba, a Greek word meaning that they would achieve the opposite of the intended effect, raising costs and emissions. While in Hadjiyannis’s view man-made carbon emissions were just 10% of the CO2 in the atmosphere and the maritime industry’s contribution was so miniscule that it really doesn’t matter.

We cannot simply ignore concerns around climate justice and equity in our quest to reduce emissions from shipping,” he added.
Concerns The Chamber’s position paper had urged Ghana to refrain from voting for the framework until a detailed economic impact assessment was undertaken.
However, the Chamber cautioned that the country should also prepare diplomatically to engage with the IMO process to shape the final rules.","The Ghana Chamber of Shipping has described the International Maritime Organisation’s (IMO) decision to delay the adoption of its Net-Zero Framework (NZF) by one year as a prudent and necessary step that aligns with its earlier call for a pause to assess the policy’s potential impact on developing economies such as Ghana.

At the IMO’s recent extraordinary session in London last week, member states voted to postpone the final decision on the NZF until late 2026. The framework, which seeks to reduce emissions from international shipping through the setting of carbon intensity targets and a compliance mechanism, had been expected to enter into force in March 2027.

The delay follows growing concerns among developing countries about the economic implications of the proposed measures and the absence of clear guidelines for implementation.

Two weeks prior to the vote, the Ghana Chamber of Shipping had released a position paper warning that immediate adoption of the NZF would expose Ghana’s fragile, import-dependent economy to “yet unquantified economic impacts” without sufficient clarity on the pathways for mitigating those impacts.

The Chamber argued that the country’s largely ageing shipping fleet, low level of ship ownership, and limited alternative fuel capacity left it ill-prepared to meet the framework’s requirements.

Reacting to the outcome of the IMO vote, Stanley R. K. Ahorlu, a maritime lawyer and President of the Ghana Chamber of Shipping, said the decision “reflects reasoned restraint rather than delay.”

He noted that while some may view the postponement as a setback to global decarbonisation, for developing maritime states it represents “an opportunity to secure fairness before committing to long-term obligations.”

“For those who supported adoption now rather than later, the legal maxim ‘justice delayed is justice denied’ may resonate clearly,” Mr. Ahorlu said.

“But another equally important maxim—‘Fiat justitia et ruant coeli,’ meaning ‘let justice be done though the heavens fall’—captures the decision taken by many African states on this matter. We cannot simply ignore concerns around climate justice and equity in our quest to reduce emissions from shipping,” he added.

Concerns

The Chamber’s position paper had urged Ghana to refrain from voting for the framework until a detailed economic impact assessment was undertaken. It also warned that Ghana risked paying higher freight costs as shipping companies passed on new carbon charges, and that the framework’s technical and financial requirements could render much of the country’s existing fleet stranded.

According to the paper, Ghana’s beneficial ship ownership accounts for only 0.03 percent of global tonnage, meaning it would benefit little from the NZF’s reward mechanism for compliant shipowners. It further argued that the disbursement criteria of the Net Zero Fund, which is expected to finance fleet renewal and training, were yet to be developed, with the lack of clear line of sight to funds potentially leaving African operators at a disadvantage.

The Chamber also highlighted that Ghana forecasts show that by 2030, it was unlikely that Ghana would be able to produce even a third of the alternative fuels (biofuels or methanol) that its national fleet would require under the framework’s fuel transition rules, making the country’s near-term compliance technically challenging and financially costly.

Reassessment

The IMO’s postponement is seen by maritime analysts as a signal that the organization intends to address these concerns more comprehensively.

During the next year, working groups are expected to finalise operational guidelines on the framework including the zero and near-zero fuel lifecycle analysis, food security, and the Net Zero Fund; the latter being critical for determining eligibility criteria for accessing funding, as well as the approach to compensating economies facing disproportionate negative impacts from the implementation of the NZF.

Mr. Ahorlu said Ghana should use the intervening period to strengthen its policy and institutional capacity.

“While the pace may appear slow, the wheels of (climate) justice turn slowly but grind exceedingly fine,” he said, adding that Ghana must not waste the window of opportunity to develop a national decarbonisation roadmap.

Industry observers agree that the delay could benefit Ghana if properly used as it offers policymakers time to evaluate how the NZF will affect trade, shipping costs, and the country’s competitiveness, while also exploring opportunities in seafarer training and fleet modernisation.

However, the Chamber cautioned that the country should also prepare diplomatically to engage with the IMO process to shape the final rules.

The IMO’s decision follows mounting pressure from several developing countries and trade associations that had questioned whether the NZF, in its current form, sufficiently reflected the principle of “common but differentiated responsibilities” under the Paris Agreement.",https://thebftonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Picture5-3-e1761088824118.jpg,N,,2025-10-22 03:16:44.075391

After days of tense negotiations, the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) voted on Oct. 17 to defer discussions on the Net-Zero Framework (NZF) for one year.

The NZF outlines a global carbon-pricing scheme under which high-emission vessels would face penalties, while revenues would reward cleaner ships. The committee’s 176 member states had been expected to vote on its formal adoption, but instead considered a motion proposed by Saudi Arabia to postpone the debate for another year. The proposal passed with 57 votes in favor and 49 opposed. China, which had previously voiced support for the NZF, voted in favor of the delay.

“The delay leaves the shipping sector drifting in uncertainty,” Faig Abbasov, director of shipping at the environmental group Transport & Environment, told Reuters. Danish shipping company Maersk said the IMO’s decision marked a loss of momentum for the industry’s decarbonization efforts, adding that it will wait to see how the organization intends to continue the work on the framework, Reuters reported.

With the process now on hold, the question is what the industry should do during this gap year.

Greece, one of the world’s leading shipping nations, took a cautious stance on the proposed International Maritime Organization (IMO) carbon tax.

In this context, the Greek minister of maritime affairs and insular policy, Vasilis Kikilias, in an official statement, underlined that shipping needs international, fair and realistic rules, accepted by all member states, and not punitive mechanisms that will endanger the stability of global trade.

As he noted, Greece, with its long naval tradition and the strongest fleet internationally, will play an active role in the new negotiations that will determine the final IMO framework for the green transition of shipping.

Greek minister of maritime affairs and insular policy, Vasilis Kikilias raised similar points few weeks ago in the Maritime Cyprus 2025 Conference in Limassol.

He called for improvements, stressing that more realistic timetables, fair treatment of transitional fuels and smarter use of reward mechanisms are needed.

The minister emphasized that “we agree on the framework, but we want realism. LNG has proven its reliability and must be utilized as a transitional fuel. We still do not have zero or near-zero emission fuels, not even to approach the reduction targets of the coming decade. The cost of the transition is very high, and a significant part of it must return to the shipping industry and the corresponding infrastructures.”

Some Greek shipowners, big names in the world shipping, long regarded as the industry’s traditionalists, publicly denounced the framework, calling it “unrealistic” and “detached from the commercial realities of global trade.”

While Greek shipowners are investing in cleaner technologies they remain wary of regulatory measures that could disrupt business models.

The Union of Greek Shipowners see the delay to reach an agreement on its Net-Zero Framework and the postponement of the decision until next year as a “new opportunity to shape a sustainable and effective international framework that will guide global shipping safely and realistically through the green transition.”

Athens, while acknowledging the agreement’s flaws, it says “is ready to lead constructively, with evidence-based and unifying proposals, in a global effort to shape a fair, practical and enforceable clean plan, where all stakeholders assume their share of responsibility on the collective path toward the green transition.”

“The lack of consensus highlighted deep rifts over the proposed Net-Zero Framework regulation, where the positions advanced by the shipping industry were not sufficiently taken into account,” the Greek shipowners union said in its statement.

As one of the top shipping nations, Greece plays a critical role in shaping global regulations. The challenge now is to find a path that balances environmental goals with economic realities, ensuring that the transition to clean shipping is both realistic and effective.

Statement of Greek minister of maritime affairs and insular policy, Vasilis Kikilias

“Shipping needs international rules accepted by all and not punitive mechanisms. Greece, as the largest power in global shipping, has always supported the IMO as the exclusive regulator of shipping rules. It raised its concern early on the so-called “zero emissions framework”, proposing significant improvements, so that it meets the real needs and capabilities of all shipping sectors and the reality of the global fuel market.

“The negotiations that followed have been arduous and have highlighted serious weaknesses in terms of implementation schedules, the unfair treatment of LNG fuel, and the unjustifiably high penalties on shipping which, if adopted, would probably cause serious disruptions in world trade and increases in product prices.

“The adoption of the final agreement has been postponed for a year, during which significant negotiations are required to take place among IMO members, integrating market views with realism and fairness. This is dictated by the need for energy security for both international shipping and global economic growth.

“Greece, with its great naval tradition, special know-how and the strongest fleet, will claim an important role in these negotiations for the framework under development.”

Statement of Union of Greek Shipowners

“Today’s decision to delay the process at the IMO presents a new opportunity to shape a sustainable and effective international framework that will guide global shipping safely and realistically through the green transition.

“The lack of consensus highlighted deep rifts over the proposed Net-Zero Framework regulation, where the positions advanced by the shipping industry were not sufficiently taken into account.

But reports indicate that future orders will feature the 200 MWe reactor, helping to improve endurance at sea.","In the past two years, India has announced massive investments in its nuclear energy capacity. The focus currently is to design small modular reactors (SMRs) intended for use in off-grid sites in remote areas. However, local media reports this week indicate that the government wants to extend deployment of the SMRs to commercial shipping.

India’s Bhabha Atomic Research Center (BARC), run by the government, is developing two SMR designs of 55 MWe (megawatt electric) and 200 MWe capacities. The designs named as Bharat Small Modular Reactors (BSMRs) could be used as power plants in energy-intensive industries such as cement and steel manufacturing.

“The nuclear reactors are very safe and can even be used to power merchant ships,” reported the Business Standard newspaper, citing an unnamed senior government official. The Indian Navy has already embraced nuclear propulsion, with two nuclear submarines- INS Arihant and INS Arighaat. The two submarines operate the 83 MWe nuclear reactor. But reports indicate that future orders will feature the 200 MWe reactor, helping to improve endurance at sea.

Extending the technology to civil use, including merchant shipping, would help transform India’s domestic nuclear industry. With the shipping industry working to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions footprint, nuclear technology has been fronted to play a role in decarbonizing the sector. In June, IMO’s Marine Safety Committee endorsed revisions to the SOLAS convention to include new technologies such as SMRs.

Indeed, several technology providers are fast-tracking design and production of SMRs for commercial shipping. India sees this as a good opportunity and is even working on amendments to its nuclear energy laws to include the private sector. In the past year, India has also renewed nuclear cooperation with the U.S. and France. The focus is to build its capacity for designing and producing SMRs and Advanced Modular Reactor (AMR).",https://maritime-executive.com/media/images/article/Photos/Vessels_Concepts/C-Job-future-nuclear-ships.jpg,N,,2025-10-21 23:21:01.732848

The Bahamas has become the second CARICOM country to not vote in support of a Net-Zero Shipping Framework (NZF), which aims to reduce emissions in the maritime sector.

Earlier, Antigua and Barbuda Prime Minister Gaston Browne said St. John’s did not favor voting in support of the measure being pushed by the International Maritime Organization (IMO), which was approved in April this year.

“Like the United States, we are equally concerned about this transition, and we think there should be a deferral, and if there is no deferral, then we clearly will abstain,” Browne told the state-owned ABS.

“We will not vote against it because at the end of the day, we are one of the most strident climate advocates as we have been advocating for net-zero, so we do not want to undermine our overall position on this transition to renewables and to achieve net-zero as soon as possible,” Browne said.

“The Bahamas had some time ago written to the IMO to ask for the vote to be postponed, and if the vote is not postponed, we expect to abstain,” said Foreign Affairs Minister Fred Mitchell.

IMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez said that while the IMO Net-Zero Framework “is not perfect,” it “provides a balanced basis for our further work ahead of its entry into force in 2027.”

“This process has been inclusive and thorough,” Dominguez added, urging delegates to approach the talks “with diplomacy and respect.”

Grenada

The Grenadian government suggests establishing a trilateral joint commission with Venezuela, St. Vincent, and the Grenadines to guide the process of separating maritime boundaries.

“Grenada has also started an initiative to delimit the maritime boundaries with Venezuela, St. Vincent and the Grenadines. We completed the process, you know, with Trinidad and Tobago back in 2012. We have never been clear on what the boundary is between Grenada and Venezuela, and what the boundary is between St Vincent and Grenada,” said Nazim Burke, chairman of Grenada’s oil and gas Technical Working Group (TWG).

Burke, who provided an update on the TWG activities during a town hall meeting, said, “What has happened is that our prime minister has put forward a proposal to the President of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and the Prime Minister of St. Vincent for the establishment of a trilateral commission, a joint trilateral commission that will be comprised of 10 people.”

“In essence, there will be three people from each of the three countries and a chairman from another country that will guide this process and work towards the completion of the boundaries between our three countries,” he said, adding that leasing property, whether on land or sea, would require the owner to know the boundary. “It is a very important step as well because you cannot go about leasing out land to people without knowing where your boundary is, you cannot go about leasing out maritime space to people without knowing where your boundaries are,” he said.

Burke told the town hall meeting that during the past six months, the TWG members have been holding discussions with relevant stakeholders, including Trinidad and Tobago and other companies, which have conducted research and have spatial vector data about Grenada’s oil and gas.

Guyana

The Guyana government has welcomed the United Kingdom Export Finance’s (UKEF) decision to increase its financing capacity for Guyana from £2.1 billion to £3 billion.

Minister of Finance Dr. Ashni K. Singh commended the significant increase and described it as a powerful signal of London’s “strong and growing confidence” in Guyana’s robust economic trajectory.

The UK government announced a recent high-level meeting between President Irfaan Ali and a visiting delegation, including UKEF representatives and the Deputy Trade Commissioner for Latin America and the Caribbean, Jonathan Knott.

“The enhanced support from UKEF is expected to assist in ramping up development in priority sectors identified by the government of Guyana over the next five years.

Furthermore, according to a government statement, “Guyana’s private sector is also expected to benefit from additional financing to expand its operations and form strategic partnerships with British companies.”

Singh expressed gratitude on behalf of the Guyana government for Britain’s support over the years, “which has been instrumental in fostering collaboration between the two nations, as Guyana continues to accelerate its development and solidify its position as a leading investment hub in the region.”

Jamaica

LANDS, the emerging political movement in Jamaica, has expressed deep concern over the increasing militarization of the Caribbean, facilitated by governments that publicly commit to maintaining the region as a Zone of Peace while quietly enabling foreign military involvement.

In a strongly worded statement, the group criticized Caribbean leaders for allowing foreign powers to deploy military hardware in the region and for collaborating with the United States Southern Command (SouthCom) on security operations.

“Our leaders go abroad to deliver poetic rhetoric about peace and sovereignty, yet their domestic actions contradict those promises,” the statement read. “These fine words may make good headlines, but they do nothing to protect the people who continue to suffer under the shadow of foreign military influence.”

The movement warned that the Caribbean risks becoming entangled in the same kind of devastation seen in other conflict zones, comparing it with US-backed military interventions in Iraq, Afghanistan, and, more recently, Gaza, arguing that similar policies of militarization and foreign control could have grave consequences for small island nations.

The statement also highlighted the ongoing crisis in Haiti.

“After supporting coups and foreign missions that deepened Haiti’s suffering, some Caribbean governments are now opening the door to more of the same,” the group said. “These are the same forces that cannot be trusted to offer real solutions.”

The movement further criticized the deployment of US naval fleets in the Caribbean, ostensibly to combat drug trafficking, saying such missions allow foreign soldiers to operate freely in regional waters, sometimes harassing local fisher folk and limiting their livelihoods.

The group warned that normalizing such activity could pave the way for deeper foreign control. “How long before the same country that floods our region with guns deploys troops within our borders – claiming to fight crime or protect democracy?” the statement asked.

Calling on CARICOM to “grow a spine” and assert regional sovereignty, the movement urged leaders to prioritize the interests of Caribbean people over foreign powers.

St. Kitts & Nevis

The St. Kitts and Nevis government has welcomed a decision by the St. Vincent and the Grenadines-based Lynch Caribbean Brokers Ltd to include the twin-island federation in the Regional Economic Agri-Insurance Program (REAP).

This was announced during the recently concluded 19th Caribbean Week of Agriculture (CWA 2025). Agriculture, Fisheries and Marine Resources Minister Samal Duggins said the insurance program should be a vital pillar for national resilience and regional innovation.

“Agriculture and fisheries remain at the heart of our nation’s food security, livelihoods, and economic resilience. Yet, farmers and fishers are increasingly vulnerable to risks beyond their control – climate change, unpredictable weather patterns, natural disasters, pests, and market volatility,” he added.

Under the REAP project, local farmers and fishers are expected to benefit from a regional insurance program that aims to reduce their vulnerability to natural disasters, market volatility, and the growing impacts of climate change.

REAP, developed by Lynch Caribbean Brokers Ltd of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, will soon be launched in St. Kitts in partnership with the government through the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Marine Resources.

Caribbean Lynch Brokers managing director, Damian Bowen, said that the program’s design was shaped by extensive national consultation, adding that “REAP’s development was the result of careful collaboration with key stakeholders during the first quarter of 2025.

“Together with experts from the Ministry of Agriculture and members of the farming and fishing communities, we created a model tailored to real needs rather than abstract assumptions.”

REAP is expected to introduce livelihood protection, a national enrollment campaign, public education seminars, and digital dashboards that improve transparency and data-driven decision-making.

Duggins said the government is committed to strengthening resilience across the agriculture and fisheries sectors.",https://www.caribbeanlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/caribbean-roundup-2025-10-23-dr-cl01.jpg?quality=51&w=1085&p=q,N,,2025-10-21 18:16:28.466647

The carbon tax aimed to penalize shipping companies who operated vessels that ran on the current industry standard, very low sulfur fuel oil (VLSFO).
This suggests that stopping an IMO regulation is rare, but derailing it once can prevent it from being adopted anytime soon.
On Thursday, President Trump himself weighed in: “I am outraged that the International Maritime Organization is voting in London this week to pass a global Carbon Tax.
“I can say it was a knife fight to the end.” While the U.S. did not outright kill the carbon tax, even delaying the vote represented a major diplomatic accomplishment.","The latest attempted U.N. power grab just got Trumped. The International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) first-of-its-kind plan to impose a global carbon tax on maritime shipping companies seemed like a cinch heading into last week’s extraordinary session — until it rammed full-steam into an uncharted American iceberg. Elections have consequences, and this administration will not surrender America’s sovereignty to unaccountable international bureaucrats.

On Friday, the IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) voted 57-49 to table the carbon tax regulation for a full 12 months, a dramatic reversal from the regulation’s 63-16 victory in a preliminary vote this April. What made the difference was resolute opposition from the Trump administration, which found a convenient ally in Saudi Arabia.

As IMO Secretary General Arsenio Dominguez, of Panama, concluded Friday’s session, he “looked like a deer in the headlights,” observed one delegate. “My plea to you is not to repeat the way we have negotiated this week,” Dominguez complained. “This was not the normal IMO meeting,” he added. “Be nice and kind to each other. It doesn’t cost much.”

The functionary’s choice of words was disastrously inaccurate. In this case, the cost of being too nice was both quantifiable and unacceptably high. The carbon tax aimed to penalize shipping companies who operated vessels that ran on the current industry standard, very low sulfur fuel oil (VLSFO). The steep tax was calculated to make VLSFO just as expensive as non-carbon-based fuels (such as green ammonia, which is currently two to four times as expensive).

Thus, the U.N. proposed to dramatically raise the cost of maritime fuel, a major cost input of all maritime shipping, which accounts for 90% of all international trade. The regulation would have raised the costs of all imported goods for Americans by as much as 10% — as much again as Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs.

In addition to the economic burden, approving such a regulation would also concede the principle that the U.N. may lay and collect taxes on private companies like any national government, a massive concession of sovereignty that would lead to any number of unforeseeable consequences in the future. “This is a bigger deal than I think anybody realizes,” U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Mike Waltz said before the Friday vote.

As for being “nice and kind,” the IMO traditionally makes decisions by consensus, which is a nice way of saying that some entrenched powers make all the decisions, and everyone else is compelled to play along. The IMO rarely even has to call a vote on the rules it adopts.

Both national governments and the shipping industry itself had endorsed the regulation, which seems to be an attempt by European nations to standardize their own costly green energy policies for the world. Dominguez was apparently affronted by the Trump administration’s importation of adversarial politics to obstruct this sinister scheme.

“I’ve been in this industry for 30 years and I’ve never seen anything like it,” said one shipping executive. “You just don’t say NO to these guys. It’s unheard of.” For a similar precedent, one would have to reach back to 1984, when the IMO failed to adopt a draft of the International Convention on Liability and Compensation for Damage in Connection with the Carriage of Hazardous and Noxious Substances by Sea (HNS Convention). A revised draft did not reemerge for another 10 years, and in 2009 the convention has still not entered into effect. This suggests that stopping an IMO regulation is rare, but derailing it once can prevent it from being adopted anytime soon.

Indeed, the extraordinary usurpation of sovereignty conceived in the IMO scheme impelled delegates to extraordinary measures to defend the citizens of their own nations. Before the IMO meeting, three U.S. cabinet secretaries published a joint statement threatening retaliatory sanctions, tariffs, and other economic measures for any nation who voted for the maritime carbon tax. On Thursday, President Trump himself weighed in:

“I am outraged that the International Maritime Organization is voting in London this week to pass a global Carbon Tax. The United States will NOT stand for this Global Green New Scam Tax on Shipping, and will not adhere to it in any way, shape, or form. We will not tolerate increased prices on American Consumers OR, the creation of a Green New Scam Bureaucracy to spend YOUR money on their Green dreams. Stand with the United States, and vote NO in London tomorrow!”

“That Trump Truth Social post sent shockwaves through the building,” confessed one delegate at the IMO session in London.

Beyond these external threats, the United States and other nations with similar interests engaged in what one shipping publication, GCaptain, called “delay tactics and procedural sabotage.” For example, the U.S. proposed to change the IMO’s adoption process to require “explicit” adoption, so that each nation that was party to existing protocols would have to individually approve the amended regulations.

In these negotiations, the U.S. played an excellent “bad cop” to Saudi Arabia’s “good cop.” While America threatened tariffs and acted tough, Saudi Arabia promised sweetheart economic deals and offered compromises. The two-pronged strategy convinced China to change its vote, while Greece, Cyprus, Japan, and South Korea — who has supported the regulations in April — abstained.

Eventually, the IMO voted to table the measure, rather than vote it up or down. An up-or-down vote would have required a two-thirds majority to pass and, if unsuccessful, would have killed the regulation for good. Instead, the vote to table means that the regulation can return for another vote in 12 months’ time.

Singapore advanced the motion to table, and Saudi Arabia called it to a vote. The motion to table was a close affair, passing 57 to 49, with 21 countries abstaining. If only five nations flipped their votes, or nine nations who abstained had voted, the outcome would have been different.

GCaptain CEO John Konrad reported that the negotiations continued down to the wire. “I can’t share the details on how @michaelgwaltz & @SecRubio have, in just a few days, organized the greatest opposition to UN policy since the Cold War and blocked this UN Carbon Tax,” he wrote. “I can say it was a knife fight to the end.”

While the U.S. did not outright kill the carbon tax, even delaying the vote represented a major diplomatic accomplishment. More than that, it will also push back the earliest possible implementation of the regulation — even if it passes next October — to 2030, complicating the aggressive timeline for the world’s shipping fleet to reach “Net Zero” carbon emissions by 2050. This might send international bureaucrats back to the drawing board entirely.

Industry players have chosen to gripe about Trump saving their bacon, betraying an ideological commitment to climate change ideology. But one line from analysts at Jeffries’ investment bank concedes the real point. “If there is one benefit to the IMO’s stalled initiatives,” they admitted, “it is that shipping costs may be coming down.”

For American families, that is the whole goal — why isn’t it a goal for the IMO?

“This is another HUGE win for @POTUS,” declared U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio. “Thanks to his leadership, the United States prevented a massive UN tax hike on American consumers that would have funded progressive climate pet projects. Our country will continue to lead the way and put America FIRST.”

Even his opponents seem ready to grant that this victory is one Trump earned. “Absolutely none of the maritime experts I interviewed early this week thought the US could pull this off. Zero. Massive amounts of money, NGO influence, diplomatic threat and media manipulation were behind this,” summarized Konrad. “And yet Trump did it.”",https://www.frc.org/img/domain/frc/item/AE25J119_NORMAL.jpg,N,,2025-10-21 18:16:33.388045

The IMO has already set decarbonization targets for the shipping sector, which accounts for about 3% of global carbon emissions, but is still in the process of certifying fuels for that transition.
“This could be an extremely important market for both U.S. and Brazilian ethanol.” With ethanol supply growing, the delay comes at a difficult time, noted Edmundo Barbosa, president of the Paraíba Sugar and Ethanol Industry Association (Sindaçúcar-PB).
“We need new destinations for ethanol,” he said.
Industry estimates suggest that blending ethanol into just 10% of the global marine fuel supply would create annual demand for about 50 billion liters.","The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has postponed for at least one year the certification of ethanol as a low-carbon fuel alternative for ships, dealing a setback to shipowners and ethanol producers, especially those in Brazil. The delay, decided at an IMO meeting on Friday (17) after pressure from the U.S. delegation, has frustrated industry players who saw maritime transport as a major new market for biofuels.

The IMO has already set decarbonization targets for the shipping sector, which accounts for about 3% of global carbon emissions, but is still in the process of certifying fuels for that transition. The agency’s roadmap calls for a 20% cut in emissions by 2030, a 70-80% reduction by 2040, and net-zero emissions by 2050.

Mário Campos, president of Bioenergia Brasil, an association representing 214 Brazilian sugar and ethanol mills, called the decision “disappointing.” “It’s hard to understand how the United States pressures Brazil with tariffs on ethanol imports while simultaneously blocking a market they could also supply,” he told Valor on the sidelines of the 25th Datagro International Conference on Sugar and Ethanol. “This could be an extremely important market for both U.S. and Brazilian ethanol.”

With ethanol supply growing, the delay comes at a difficult time, noted Edmundo Barbosa, president of the Paraíba Sugar and Ethanol Industry Association (Sindaçúcar-PB). “We need new destinations for ethanol,” he said.

Shipping companies were also caught off guard. “It was disappointing,” said Morten Christiansen, senior vice president and head of decarbonization at Danish shipping giant Maersk, during a press conference in São Paulo earlier that day. “We’re losing time,” he warned, attributing the delay to “political tensions,” but adding that “it’s not the end for ethanol at the IMO.”

Mr. Christiansen, who took part in the IMO discussions, described Friday’s meeting as “unusual.” “We’re still trying to understand what happened. I hope there will be another meeting within a year,” he said, although he cautioned that there is a “high risk” that ethanol’s classification may not move forward.

Some producers sought to downplay the impact. “The postponement isn’t necessarily bad news,” said Gustavo Mariano, vice president of trading at Inpasa. “It gives us more time to demonstrate ethanol’s potential as a viable alternative,” he told reporters.

Despite the IMO’s decision, Maersk said it will continue testing ethanol blends in its marine fuels. Trials with methanol-powered engines are expected to conclude Thursday, with encouraging results so far. Other maritime technology companies, including Finland’s Wärtsilä and Switzerland’s WinGD, are also developing ship engines capable of running on ethanol.

To underscore its commitment, Maersk issued a joint statement with Brazil’s five largest ethanol producers—Raízen, Copersucar, Atvos, FS, and Inpasa—pledging to advance ethanol as a sustainable marine fuel. The declaration was released Monday (20) morning.

Industry estimates suggest that blending ethanol into just 10% of the global marine fuel supply would create annual demand for about 50 billion liters. While the potential is significant, Mr. Campos of Bioenergia Brasil said certification alone would not open the market immediately. “It takes time to replace all the necessary equipment,” he noted.

The IMO’s technical committee is expected to continue debating ethanol’s inclusion as an approved sustainable fuel. According to Arnaldo Jardim, vice president of Brazil’s Congressional Agricultural Front (FPA), who spoke at the Datagro conference, “the work to secure ethanol’s certification next year must start right now.”

Compared with alternatives such as e-methanol, ammonia, and even green hydrogen, ethanol entered the IMO’s decarbonization debate later. Danilo Veras, vice president for regulatory policy at Maersk Latin America, said this delay stems partly from ethanol’s production complexity. Life-cycle analysis plays a key role, requiring accounting for emissions at every stage, from crop cultivation to fuel combustion, he said.

From their various achievements in clean zero emissions and technology and continued efforts, here are a few notable projects and milestones that have solidified the Port of San Diego as a “Port of Firsts.”

A Legacy of Famous Firsts

First all-electric mobile harbor cranes in North America. The two Konecranes Generation 6 Mobile Harbor Cranes are transforming the way the U.S. West Coast handles cargo with their superior performance and fast offloading speeds.

When used in tandem, the Port’s all-electric mobile harbor cranes boast the highest lift capacity on the U.S. West Coast. The bigger the lift, the bigger the cargo. The arrival of this technology affects a variety of industries that require large equipment. Now, the U.S. West Coast can seamlessly move ship engines to shipyards for repair or building.

First all-electric tugboat, operated by Crowley Maritime. Specifically designed to support maritime operations at the Port, the eWolf is an 82-foot vessel with 70 tons of bollard pull and is a historic milestone for the maritime industry.

Fun Fact: Over the first 10 years of its use, the new eTug will reduce 178 tons of nitrogen oxide, 2.5 tons of diesel particulate matter, and 3,100 metric tons of carbon dioxide versus a conventional tug.

Among the first in the United States to install shore power for ocean going vessels. The Port put its first shore power connection at the cruise terminals into service in 2010, making it among the first ports in California to have shore power available for cruise ships and beating a state regulation to reduce diesel particulate emissions from at least 50 percent of cruise calls by nearly four years.

Among the first ports to adopt a Climate Action Plan. In 2013, the Port adopted a Climate Action Plan to provide a long-term vision for sustainability by decreasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

Upcoming: Zero Emissions (ZE) Truck Charging Facility

The pursuit of technological innovation does not stop at the Port of San Diego. In continuation of their legacy as environmental champions and a leader in maritime operations, the Port is pursuing development of the first public-facing zero emissions (ZE) truck charging facility in San Diego County.

Greenhouse gas emissions from shipping account for about 3% of total emissions worldwide.
The regulations would set a marine fuel standard on the amount of greenhouse gas emissions allowed from fuels used in shipping.
The U.S maritime industry believes the global tax would cost American shippers more than $100 billion over the next seven years, if enacted.
However, the theory of a carbon tax becomes fraught when dealing with real-world politics.","The world’s largest maritime nations met in London last week to consider adopting regulations that would set a global tax on greenhouse gas emissions from shipping for ships of all types — cargo and cruise. In April, members of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) agreed on the contents of the regulatory framework and intended to adopt it at the meeting. However, the Trump administration’s pressure — through threats of tariffs, visa restrictions, and financial penalties, alongside arguments about potential costs and national security risks — convinced nations to vote to delay a decision on the framework by a year. According to the Associated Press, if the IMO agreed to the regulation, it would have been the first global tax on greenhouse gas emissions. The proposal would have entered into force beginning in 2027, with a target for reaching net zero emissions in 2050. Greenhouse gas emissions from shipping account for about 3% of total emissions worldwide.

The system for compliance is essentially a cap and trade program with an associated pricing system that would impose fees for every ton of greenhouse gases emitted by ships above allowable limits. Via the Associated Press, there is a base level target of compliance for the allowable greenhouse gas intensity of fuels and there is a more stringent direct compliance target that requires further reduction in the greenhouse gas intensity. Greenhouse gas fuel intensity measures the amount of greenhouse gases emitted per unit of energy used.

The regulations would set a marine fuel standard on the amount of greenhouse gas emissions allowed from fuels used in shipping. The standard would decrease over time, making it more difficult to meet. Fees would be imposed on the greenhouse gases emitted above the standard. As explained by the Associated Press, ships that have lower emissions than the compliance target earn “surplus units,” or credits. Ships with emissions above the standard would have to buy credits from ships having credits or from the IMO at $380 per metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent. Additionally, there’s a penalty of $100 per metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent to reach direct compliance.

Via the Associated Press, the fees could generate $11 billion to $13 billion in revenue in the first year. The revenues are to go into an IMO fund to invest in fuels and technologies needed to transition to net zero, reward low-emission ships, and support developing countries in making the transition. The rules are designed to make biofuels the cheapest fuel to use for compliance, as the fees to meet the standards close the cost gap between fossil fuels and alternative fuels such as ammonia, hydrogen, and methanol.

Since large ships operate for about 25 years, the industry would need to make changes and investments now to reach net-zero at the target date around 2050. According to FreightWaves, Ocean carriers for years have been proactive in reducing emissions. About 41% of container ships on order – more than half the tonnage on order — are designed to operate with alternative fuels such as liquefied natural gas or ammonia.

Before the vote, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Energy Secretary Chris Wright, and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy jointly said that the Trump administration “unequivocally rejects” the maritime proposal. The U.S maritime industry believes the global tax would cost American shippers more than $100 billion over the next seven years, if enacted.

Analysis

In addition to violating the sovereignty of nations to impose their own taxes, a global tax on greenhouse gas emissions from ships would have imposed immense costs on the industry, which is responsible for 90% of global trade and only produces 3% of carbon emissions. Carbon taxes and cap and trade programs are often sold as a common-sense policy solution to transition carbon-intensive industries towards low- or zero-carbon alternatives. However, the theory of a carbon tax becomes fraught when dealing with real-world politics. As IER’s Samuel Peterson and Alex Stevens wrote for the National Interest, “Carbon taxes are frequently presented as scientifically sound and politically feasible tools for climate mitigation. However, they are fraught with methodological, political, and economic challenges that warrant serious reconsideration.”",https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/bigstock-Cargo-Boat-Close-Up-1851648-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-10-21 20:16:37.904614

During the IMO MEPC meeting, Members voted to postpone approving a plan to curb shipping emissions.","The oceans are the source of life and the great unifier of our distant civilisations. Civilisations are built on trade and relations, much of which happens via shipping, today. Over the last few centuries, sea trade and Naval power have redefined the global order and landscape. However, as we move further away from the age of sails, the global shipping industry has become one of the biggest polluters of our planet. Many attempts have been made to address this issue; progress has been slow. This week, fresh attempts have been made on the global stage, only to be pushed back by a handful of powerful nations, who would rather see their ill-advised short-term progress and geopolitical contests succeed, over the long-term safety of the planet and our oceans.

The International Maritime Organisation (IMO) was pushing a new piece of international legislation to establish a legally binding framework to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from ships globally, aiming for net-zero emissions by or around a target year of 2050. The effort, championed by many small coastal states, scientists, academia and some segments of the industry, was expected to become the first in the world to combine mandatory emission limits and GHG pricing across an entire industry sector. The legislation is named the IMO Net-zero Framework. This legislation was first approved by the Marine Environment Protection Committee during its 83rd session (MEPC 83) from 7-11 April this year, and they include a new fuel standard for ships and a global pricing mechanism for emissions. These measures, set to be formally adopted in October this year before entry into force in 2027, will become mandatory for large ocean-going ships over 5,000 gross tonnages, which emit 85% of the total CO2 emissions from international shipping. The legislation also included a new chapter on prevention of air pollution from ships to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL). Currently, MARPOL’s Annex VI has 108 parties, covering 97% of the world’s merchant shipping fleet by tonnage, and already includes mandatory energy efficiency requirements for ships.

The key elements of the IMO Net-Zero Framework would require ships to comply with: “Global fuel standard: Ships must reduce, over time, their annual greenhouse gas fuel intensity (GFI) – that is, how much GHG is emitted for each unit of energy used. This is calculated using a well-to-wake approach. A global economic measure: Ships emitting above GFI thresholds will have to acquire remedial units to balance its deficit emissions, while those using zero or near-zero GHG technologies will be eligible for financial rewards,” the IMO said.

Meanwhile, to ensure compliance, the legislation would have two levels of compliance with GHG Fuel Intensity targets: a Base Target and a Direct Compliance Target at which ships would be eligible to earn ‘surplus units’. This would allow ships that emit above the set thresholds to balance their emissions deficit by, either transferring surplus units from other ships; using surplus units they have already banked, or using remedial units acquired through contributions to the IMO Net-Zero Fund.

However, an extraordinary session of the Marine Environment Protection Committee of the IMO which met recently was to seek its members approval for the new legislation and to amend the MARPOL. But alas, this progressive step towards making our globe more sustainable and safer was torpedoed by the US President Donald Trump, whose verbal sabre rattling threatened the IMO Member Nations not to move forward with the first of its kind global carbon tax, and threatened to impose sanctions on countries that supported the measure. During the IMO MEPC meeting, Members voted to postpone approving a plan to curb shipping emissions. The coerced postponement of the adoption of shipping carbon tax is a clear sight of how ‘might is right’ has overshadowed the ‘rules-based order’ and the multilateralism which many small states like Sri Lanka is dependent on to avoid being treaded on by powerful nations. Sri Lanka, despite its weak economic standing, and market-risk, should at least find the guts to voice its concern about such blackmail by powerful nations such as the United States. If we keep quiet, what more will we be forced to endure? Afterall, it is small coastal states like Sri Lanka that have to face the brunt of climate change and the rise of ocean levels due to global warming.",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/the-morning-39270.appspot.com/o/articles%2F7RFv2vD96kbZCEvm6aY4?alt=media&token=a52641cb-36ef-407d-88fb-71b12b5752bd,N,,2025-10-21 15:16:32.965669
