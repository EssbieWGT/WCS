Both Greece and Cyprus broke ranks from the EU position against delaying adoption of the framework, deviating from established EU protocols of ensuring a unified bloc vote of 27 member states.

Their decision to abstain from the vote left other EU states and senior officials from within the European Commission “furious”, according to several member state officials who spoke to Lloyd’s List on condition of anonymity.

The commission is waiting for a legal service opinion before considering options, however, given the vote to delay was not a written part of the coordinated position of the EU states agreed in advance, Greece and Cyprus are likely to argue they did not break EU protocols.

If an infringement case cannot be stacked up, other avenues of reprisals against Greece and Cyprus may be on the cards with state aid clearance for maritime a potential target to make a point.

Each EU member state has state aid guidelines for maritime transport covering everything from tonnage tax to social security schemes for seafarers. These have to be cleared by the European Commission.

“It was an absolute catastrophe and what they did was a disgrace,” said one EU member state representative who was present during the IMO voting.

“We can do nothing if we are not 27 and stick together, and they knew that.”

EU member states had previously agreed to support the adoption of the IMO net zero strategy and the Net-Zero Framework.

Greece, however, remains unapologetic over the unprecedented decision to not vote with fellow EU states and on Tuesday moved to remove all reference to the IMO agreement from the bloc’s joint negotiating position for this year’s COP30 climate summit.

According to reports first carried in Politico and later confirmed independently by Lloyd’s List, Athens objected to a single passage, the final paragraph of the text, that “welcome[d]” the IMO measures “as the first legally binding global sectoral climate regulation that will contribute to the reduction of emissions from shipping”.

Greece had opposed any mention of the IMO levy and rejected several attempts at compromise. With the text requiring unanimous approval from the EU’s 27 governments, the IMO reference was deleted entirely.

According to EU shipping officials this all amounts to a hardening of Greek opposition to EU climate policy in maritime that will continue to have repercussions for the EU negotiating position inside the IMO and other bodies.

Neither the European Commission nor the Greek government have responded to Lloyd’s List’s requests for comment on the issue.

Following the IMO vote, Greece’s Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, published an opinion article in the Financial Times questioning the pace of decarbonisation policy and apparently contradicting established EU positions.

“While European countries still burn coal in our power plants and oil to heat our homes and factories, we are pushing for the decarbonisation of ships and planes and of the most difficult industrial processes,” Mitsotakis wrote.

“This emphasis on tackling all emissions at once is shortsighted… It is also increasingly obvious that the last few steps to achieving climate neutrality will be very expensive. We ought to tread carefully, maintain flexibility and make sure that the maths adds up,” he continued.",https://www.lloydslist.com/-/media/lloyds-list/images/regulation/2025-new-pictures/mepc-oct-2025-day-3-alt.png?rev=82528b67f6f1449087f5f2c83caa5d79,N,,2025-10-23 14:16:30.048788

The us has warned of retaliatory measures against nations supporting a proposed carbon emissions tax for shipping, as the UN's International Maritime Organization (IMO) works to adopt it's Net-Zero Framework, reports New York's FreightWaves.

The US State Department called the plan a 'European-led neocolonial export of global climate regulations' and said it would not accept any agreement that unfairly burdens American interests. The IMO vote is scheduled for October 14-17 in London.

Under the proposal, vessel operators must report greenhouse gas emissions annually. Ships exceeding limits will pay fees, while those using cleaner fuels will receive incentives. The IMO would collect revenues through a Net-Zero Fund.

The US warned it may block vessels from its ports, impose visa restrictions on crews, and apply penalties to government contracts and liquefied natural gas terminals. Additional port fees and sanctions on officials backing climate policies are also being considered.

The statement was signed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, and Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy. They urged IMO members to reject the Net-Zero Framework and prioritise economic and energy security.

Ocean carriers have already taken steps to reduce emissions. About 41 per cent of containerships on order are designed for alternative fuels such as liquefied natural gas or ammonia. The largest ships account for 85 per cent of sector emissions.

Nearly all ocean-going ships are built outside the US, with 51 per cent in China, 28 per cent in South Korea, and 15 per cent in Japan. The US reversal on IMO cooperation echoes its stance on the International Criminal Court, which it helped develop but never ratified.

The NZF had been in the works for several years and had gained wide consensus before IMO’s recent decision. The decision creates considerable uncertainty in the sector, coming amid intense U.S. opposition that appears unlikely to wane, and the MEPC continues to pursue adoption of the NZF.

Key Takeaways

The MEPC deferred a decision to make the NZF legally binding until October 2026

The U.S. vehemently opposed adoption of the NZF, threatening to impose trade, port, and other restrictions on countries supporting the measure

The MEPC will continue work to define fundamental elements of the NZF and achieve consensus on its adoption

European Union (EU) measures regulating shipping GHG emissions will remain in place, and other countries may consider similar measures

The IMO decision creates considerable regulatory uncertainty for stakeholders across the shipping supply chain, and they should prepare to engage policymakers on several fronts

Background

The NZF would establish a legally binding regulatory framework to achieve net-zero GHG emissions ""by or around, i.e. close to, 2050,"" as articulated in the 2023 IMO Strategy on Reduction of GHG Emissions from Ships, agreed by the MEPC in July 2023. If adopted, the NZF would be included as a new chapter 5 in Annex VI to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL).

The NZF combines a global fuel standard and GHG emissions pricing mechanism applicable to ships over 5,000 gross tonnage. The scheme endorsed by the MEPC in April creates two tiers of GHG fuel intensity (GFI) targets, a Base Target (BT) and a more stringent Direct Compliance Target (DCT). In simplified terms, ships that fail to meet the targets generate ""compliance deficits"" and would be required to acquire Remedial Units (RUs), while ships that exceed the DCT could generate bankable Surplus Units (SUs). RUs would be acquired by making ""pricing contributions"" to a yet-to-be-established IMO Net-Zero Fund. Ships that use ""Zero or Near-Zero GHG emission technologies, fuels and/or energy sources"" (ZNZs) would be eligible to receive ""Rewards"" (annual compensation) from the IMO Net-Zero Fund.

Recent IMO Actions

The MEPC approved the text of the NZF at its 83rd meeting in April (MEPC 83) and had targeted formal approval needed to make it legally binding at its extraordinary session held last week (October 14-17). However, support for the NZF weakened in the intervening months amid U.S. threats of trade and other retaliation measures against countries supporting the measure. The MEPC ultimately adopted a resolution to adjourn the ES until October 2026 without approving the NZF.

In a statement issued after the extraordinary session, the MEPC affirmed its intention to continue work on developing NZF implementation guidelines to further define fundamental aspects of the scheme and achieve consensus on adopting the measure. Work to develop these guidelines is already beginning at this week's meeting of the Intersessional Working Group on the Reduction of Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Ships.

The U.S. first signaled its ""unequivocal"" opposition to the NZF on April 9, 2025, when it announced its withdrawal from MEPC 83, urging other governments to ""reconsider"" their support for the agreement and warning it could consider ""reciprocal measures."" The U.S. escalated these threats in a joint statement issued August 12, 2025, by the U.S. Departments of State, Transportation, Energy, and Commerce, and ultimately detailed retaliatory measures it planned to consider in a policy statement issued on the eve of last week's MEPC ES, including targeted port access and visa restrictions, sanctions, penalties, and port fees. The U.S. has made clear its intent to ""levy these remedies against nations that sponsor this European-led neocolonial export of global climate regulations.""

IMO adoption of the NZF would have triggered a process to consider changes to European Union (EU) measures regulating shipping GHGs - the Emissions Trading System (ETS) (Directive (EU) 2023/959) and FuelEU Maritime regulation (Regulation (EU) 2023/1805). The decision to postpone consideration of the NZF means these measures remain intact and, more broadly, that the shipping industry will continue to face a patchwork of regional and/or country-specific regulations governing GHG emissions and maritime fuel.

What’s Next

Going forward, ship owners, charterers, and other supply-chain stakeholders, including fuel suppliers and ship builders, should monitor developments closely and engage on multiple fronts, including:

IMO/MEPC efforts to achieve consensus on the NZF, which could require negotiating significant changes, likely with significant U.S. input;

IMO/MEPC efforts to better define key elements of the NZF through implementation guidelines to be developed by IMO bodies in the coming months;

U.S. efforts to gain leverage over NZF negotiations through a variety of trade or punitive measures; and

Efforts in other regions and countries, including the EU, to develop and/implement measures to regulate GHG emissions from ships that visit their ports.

Finally, companies in other sectors should note that the Trump administration's approach to the NZF mirrors its broader pattern of leveraging international environmental disputes to advance domestic industrial priorities and leverage bilateral trade. As such, companies affected by other international schemes, such as the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), should consider how the Trump administration's approach to the NZF may inform its approach to these schemes.",https://natlawreview.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_image/public/2025-10/global%20infrastructure%20trade%20import%20export%20logistics%20shipping%20manufacturing%20cargo%20vessel_0.jpg.webp?itok=_4jpsCoi,N,,2025-10-23 12:20:21.067502

DNV says a cost-effective and proven nuclear fuel cycle, tailored for maritime use, must be developed by the industry.
""Crucially, storage and disposal of spent nuclear fuel are fundamental to the functionality and credibility of the supply chain.
The development of a commercial maritime nuclear industry also needs to be supported by a ""predictable and internationally accepted"" regulatory framework, DNV says.
""It demands coordinated global action, involving a wide range of actors across the maritime industry, regulators, and society in general.","The shipping industry consumes some 350 million tonnes of fossil fuel annually and accounts for about 3% of total worldwide carbon emissions. In July 2023, the shipping industry, via the International Maritime Organization (IMO), approved new targets for greenhouse gas emission reductions, aiming to reach net-zero emissions by, or around, 2050.

""Nuclear propulsion, once regarded as a distant prospect, is now under active consideration as a real option for the commercial maritime fleet,"" DNV Senior Principal Researcher Ole Christen Reistad says in the foreword a new white paper. ""Shipyards and shipowners are exploring its potential and weighing the promise of virtually emission-free power against the complexity of introducing such a transformative technology into commercial fleets.""

DNV's white paper - titled Maritime nuclear propulsion: Technologies, commercial viability, and regulatory challenges for nuclear-powered vessels - highlights how maritime nuclear technologies differ from land-based reactors, and emphasises the need to address technological, regulatory, and commercial factors in the effort to understand the potential role of nuclear propulsion. The paper addresses the main elements of the future maritime fuel cycle – including fuel management, waste handling, vessel construction and operation, and oversight of nuclear supply chains – and presents the reactor technologies most likely to be adopted by shipowners. Advances in automation, digitalisation, and modular design are identified as critical enablers of safety, security, and non-proliferation of future nuclear fuels and reactors, thereby paving the way for public acceptance.

""All maritime nuclear technologies will differ from land-based equivalents due to some key characteristics, such as mobility, exposure to harsh sea conditions, and operational profile,"" the paper notes. ""Further, maritime installations will vary significantly depending on their purpose - propulsion (nuclear-powered ships) or power generation (floating nuclear power plants).""

DNV says a cost-effective and proven nuclear fuel cycle, tailored for maritime use, must be developed by the industry. This includes establishing clearly defined roles and responsibilities across the supply chain, from fuel production and reactor integration to loading, exchange, and disposal. ""Crucially, storage and disposal of spent nuclear fuel are fundamental to the functionality and credibility of the supply chain. Reactor design and fuel type will directly influence these requirements, and these factors must be addressed before any operating licence is granted.""

As part of this, it says provisions for the whole maritime fuel cycle - including long-term waste management - are essential, not only for regulatory compliance but also for advancing public acceptance.

The development of a commercial maritime nuclear industry also needs to be supported by a ""predictable and internationally accepted"" regulatory framework, DNV says. Organisations such as the IMO and the International Atomic Energy Agency must lead efforts to establish standards for fuel management, ship construction, and operational protocols. ""Classification societies will play a critical role in enabling global adoption, helping to overcome the fragmented nature of the land-based nuclear industry and fostering a standardised maritime approach,"" it says.

DNV noted: ""The regulatory landscape for nuclear shipping will likely exceed what the maritime industry is accustomed to, opening the door to multiple future system configurations. By identifying key actors, their mandates, and the need for coordination, regulatory roadmaps outlined in this white paper offer essential guidance. As roles multiply, clarifying interfaces becomes increasingly important - something these roadmaps help address by mapping key interdependencies.""

The success of future maritime nuclear installations will also depend on the development of compelling business models, according to DNV. It says these must reflect the commercial realities of shipping and provide a clear understanding of total cost of ownership, especially across the entire fuel cycle. ""Cost-competitiveness could be significantly enhanced through modular and standardised approaches, which streamline construction, simplify maintenance, provide independent assurance, and facilitate regulatory approval across jurisdictions.""

DNV case studies presented in the paper show that nuclear can out-perform other technologies under both low and high fuel price scenarios. A reactor cost below USD18,000/kW could be competitive if full decarbonisation is achieved by 2050, it suggests, while costs below USD8,000/kW could be viable even without full decarbonisation.

""Realising the potential of nuclear propulsion in maritime requires more than technological readiness,"" DNV concludes. ""It demands coordinated global action, involving a wide range of actors across the maritime industry, regulators, and society in general. With strategic investment and international collaboration, nuclear energy could become a cornerstone of the maritime energy transition, delivering safe, efficient, and zero-emission propulsion for the global fleet.""

Approval of container ship design

The release of the white paper came as DNV awarded South Korea's HD Korea Shipbuilding & Offshore Engineering (HD KSOE) - a subsidiary of HD Hyundai - Approval in Principle for a new 15,000 TEU-class container vessel design powered by small modular reactor (SMR) technology. The vessel concept incorporates a supercritical CO2-based power generation system, which can provide higher thermal efficiency and a reduced equipment footprint compared to conventional steam-based systems.

An Approval in Principle (AiP) is an independent assessment of a concept within a defined framework of requirements. It confirms the feasibility of the design and verifies that no significant technical barriers exist to its implementation.

During the development of the ship design concept, the DNV team worked closely with HD KSOE to assess the vessel's overall safety and the design of the advanced power generation system. This review included the vessel's main functions, power supply and overall approach to safety. In May 2025, HD KSOE and DNV also conducted a HAZID (Hazard Identification) workshop at DNV's headquarters in Oslo to identify potential risks and accident scenarios for nuclear-powered vessels and to guide improvements in the design.

""This SMR-powered container vessel concept represents a key milestone in our efforts to explore alternative fuels for decarbonising shipping,"" said HD KSOE Chief Technology Officer Chang Kwangpil. ""The design focuses intensely on the safety of the vessel and advancing the propulsion system in the application of SMR technology. In addition, we have developed a novel shielding and containment system, which is designed to maintain reactor safety and vessel survivability even in the event of collisions, groundings, or sinking accidents. We will continue to collaborate with global partners to advance marine nuclear technologies.""

""With little recent experience in utilising nuclear power for cargo vessels, this AiP represents an important first step in building the technical verification process for nuclear-powered vessels,"" said Geir Dugstad, Technical Director at DNV. ""We are very pleased to award KSOE this new AiP, which is the well-deserved result of an intensive and productive cooperation, which we look forward to continuing as this exciting technology continues to develop.""

Previously, HD KSOE obtained Approval in Principle from the American Bureau of Shipping for a 15,000 TEU-class container ship design model applying SMR technology.",https://world-nuclear-news.org/images/articles/MaritimeNuclearPropulsionwhitepaper(DNV)_43508.jpg,N,,2025-10-23 14:16:40.217150

Stockholm, 23 October, 2025: – Ahead of next week’s session of the Nordic Council, the Clean Arctic Alliance today called on Nordic governments to adopt a resolution on polar fuels during the meeting, and together commit to support an International Maritime Organization (IMO)regulation that would require cleaner maritime fuels, which would result in lower emissions of black carbon by ships when operating in the Arctic.

The deadline for concrete proposals for such a regulation to be submitted to the thirteenth session of the IMO’s technical committee that addresses pollution prevention and response (PPR13, February 2026) is December 5th.

“Ahead of a crucial meeting of the IMO next February, the Clean Arctic Alliance is calling for the Member States of the International Maritime Organization to develop and adopt a mandatory regulation which would require that only polar fuels can be used by shipping in the Arctic”, said Dr Sian Prior, Lead Advisor to the Clean Arctic Alliance.. “A resolution on polar fuels adopted by Nordic governments next week would send a strong message to IMO Member States that action is urgently needed to protect the Arctic from the impacts of shipping emissions.”

“Black carbon is a climate superpollutant produced when fossil fuels are burned”, said Prior. “Black carbon has a disproportionate impact because it both heats the atmosphere – and when released from ship exhausts and when near to the Arctic it settles onto snow and ice, speeding up the melting and exposing darker land and sea beneath, which continue to absorb more heat. It is the loss of the planet’s reflectivity – or albedo – which is contributing to the fast pace of warming seen in the Arctic.”

“Black carbon emissions from ships burning oil-based fuels have more than doubled in the last decade, yet a simple and easy solution is to require shipping to use widely available distillate fuels with lower black carbon emissions when operating in and near to the Arctic”, said Prior.

About Black Carbon, Polar Fuels, and the Arctic

Black carbon is a short-lived climate pollutant, produced by the incomplete burning of fossil fuels, with an impact more than three thousand times that of CO2 over a 20 year period. It makes up around one-fifth of international shipping’s climate impact. Not only does it contribute to warming while in the atmosphere, black carbon accelerates melting if deposited onto snow and ice – hence it has a disproportionate impact when released in and near to the Arctic.

The melting snow and ice exposes darker areas of land and water and these dark patches then absorb further heat from the sun and the reflective capacity of the planet’s polar ice caps is severely reduced. More heat in the polar systems – results in increased melting. This is the loss of the albedo effect.

Declines in sea ice extent and volume are leading to a burgeoning social and environmental crisis in the Arctic, while cascading changes are impacting global climate and ocean circulation. Scientists have high confidence that processes are nearing points beyond which rapid and irreversible changes on the scale of multiple human generations are possible. Scientists say it is now too late to save summer Arctic sea ice, and research has shown that “preparations need to be made for the increased extreme weather across the northern hemisphere that is likely to occur as a result.”

Black carbon also has a negative impact on human health including premature death and harmful effects on the cardiovascular system (heart, blood and blood vessels), and recent research has found black carbon particles in the body tissues of foetuses, following inhalation by pregnant mothers.

The need to reduce emissions of black carbon because of both the climate and health impacts has been long recognised. On land, considerable effort has been made to ban dirtier fuels in power stations, to install diesel particulate filters on land-based transport, and to improve the burning of dry wood – all to reduce emissions of black carbon and improve air quality. However, at sea the same efforts have not yet been made.

In a paper submitted to a meeting of the IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC 82/5/2*: Regulating Black Carbon emissions from international shipping impacting the Arctic) NGOs called on IMO Member States to consider the development of a new regulation for inclusion in MARPOL Annex VI (the main international treaty addressing air pollution prevention requirements from ships) which would identify suitable polar fuels, for example distillate fuels, such DMA or DMZ, to deliver an immediate fuel-based reduction in black carbon emissions from international shipping impacting the Arctic. The paper develops the concept of “polar fuels” discussed at technical subcommittee meeting (PPR 11) and sets out the fuel characteristics that would distinguish polar fuels from residual fuels and thus lead to fuel-based reductions in ship Black Carbon emissions if mandated for use in and near the Arctic. Polar fuels were discussed further at a meeting of the PPR technical subcommittee in January 2025, following which the Clean Arctic Alliance welcomed the broad support from IMO member states, and parts of the fuel and shipping industry, for the further development of the polar fuels concept.

Next year’s Summit will be held in Shanghai, home to one of the world’s busiest container ports.

The All Aboard Alliance launched its new 2026-2030 strategy for improving lives at sea.

A governance task force has been convened to address gaps in the enforcement of maritime governance and will present its initial actions by next year’s Summit.

23 OCTOBER 2025, ANTWERP – Only days after the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) Member States voted to postpone a decision on the Net-Zero Framework (NZF) by 12 months, more than 200 industry leaders, experts, and influential decision-makers met in Antwerp at the Global Maritime Forum Annual Summit 2025 to discuss the path forward for the sector.

“This year’s Annual Summit has provided a crucial opportunity for leaders from across the globe and maritime value chain to come together address some of the sector’s most pressing issues, including what needs to happen over the next year to set the stage for the adoption of the NZF,” said Global Maritime Forum CEO Johannah Christensen. “One of the overwhelming messages I’ve heard from participants over the last two days is how hopeful and energised they feel after the Summit, particularly coming off the back of such a disappointing outcome last week. The mood has certainly shifted.”

Throughout the Summit, IMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez also encouraged assembled industry leaders to think of the NZF delay as a pause of the adoption itself, but certainly not a pause on the work underpinning the framework.

“Shipping continues to be a global industry, and as such, needs global regulations. Yes, we have paused now on the adoption, but the work on the implementation continues,” he said in a video interview. “This extra year gives us the chance to connect with all the stakeholders and parties in order to address the questions that were raised, including the lack of clarity around the framework,” he said at a press event.

One of the themes that emerged from Summit discussions was the important role of the EU and China, as well as developing regions like Africa, as emerging centres of supply and demand for zero-emission fuels and champions that can reaffirm the support for the NZF that existed when it was agreed in April.

Shanghai to host 2026 Summit

China’s significance was underscored with the announcement that next year’s Annual Summit will be held in Shanghai, an important global maritime hub and home to one of the world’s busiest container ports.

The 2026 Summit will be supported by Shanghai Maritime University and the People’s Government of Hongkou District.

“Shanghai Maritime University is pleased to collaborate with the Global Maritime Forum, Shanghai Municipal Transportation Commission, and Shanghai Hongkou District in providing support to the Annual Summit 2026. We look forward to contributing toward an event that will bring the industry together to help drive the energy transition and digitalisation of the shipping industry,” said a representative of Shanghai Maritime University.

“Hongkou District extends its warmest welcome and steadfast support for the Global Maritime Forum Annual Summit 2026 to be held next October. As a core functional zone of the Shanghai International Shipping Center, Hongkou boasts a rich history and profound maritime heritage, having previously gathered many of the world's leading ports, shipping enterprises and institutions,” said a representative of Hongkou District.

Evolution of the All Aboard Alliance

On the second day of the Summit, the All Aboard Alliance launched its new 2030 strategy and industry ambitions for making at-sea careers more safe, attractive, and inclusive.

“With this new strategy underpinning our work, the All Aboard Alliance community can begin addressing the deep-rooted, systemic challenges facing the roughly two million seafarers who are the backbone of global trade,” said Global Maritime Forum Director of Human Sustainability Susanne Justesen. “It will require us to question these entrenched structures, ask hard questions, and confront uncomfortable truths—and it’s something none of us can do alone. We invite companies to join us in working towards a future where seafarers are at the heart of every voyage.”

The Alliance aims to track progress annually and build transparency, showcase what good looks like by defining better standards for living and working at sea, and align financial incentives towards industry adoption of those standards.

New governance taskforce convened

A key theme that has emerged in recent years is the need for strengthened governance to address uncertainty and geopolitical risks.

In Antwerp, assembled industry leaders expressed growing concern about the dark fleet putting the environment and crew safety at risk. Participants pledged to establish a task force, comprised of industry leaders from across the value chain, to explore ways to address gaps in the enforcement of maritime governance. The task force will convene in the coming weeks and present its initial actions by next year’s Summit.

The 2025 Summit was supported by partners CMB.TECH and the Port of Antwerp-Bruges.

“CMB.TECH is delighted to have partnered with the Global Maritime Forum for this year’s Annual Summit in Antwerp, the beating heart of maritime Europe,” said Alexander Saverys, CEO of CMB.TECH. “Now more than ever, our industry needed to come together to debate about trade, peace, and the future of our planet, all of which are under threat. But this is not our first shipping crisis. For more than 4,000 years, maritime men and women have proven that perseverance, vision, and bravery can make the world a better place. Energised by the positive shipping vibes at the Antwerp Summit, CMB.TECH will continue do its part.”

Jacques Vandermeiren, CEO of Port of Antwerp-Bruges, reiterated the timeliness of this year’s Summit in the wider maritime landscape.

""As the second largest port city in Europe, Antwerp has long been a meeting point for global trade. It has been our privilege to host shipowners, charterers, ports, crew managers, financiers, insurers and many other key stakeholders from across the maritime value chain here in Antwerp at the Global Maritime Forum Annual Summit 2025. At a time of uncertainty in the world, the energy and ideas shared throughout the event give us confidence in the industry’s ability to work together toward a more resilient and sustainable future,"" he says.

Denmark, Finland and Sweden are already banning scrubber washwater discharges in its territorial waters since summer 2025.
the OSPAR Commission for the North-East Atlantic decided to prohibit the discharge of scrubber washwater in internal waters from 2027 onwards.
That an organization naming itself the Clean Shipping Alliance is devoted to defending scrubbers and the continued use of heavy fuel oil is, at best, ironic.
A ban of heavy fuel oil moreover prohibits oil pests with their devastating environmental impact.","As the shipping industry faces mounting pressure to reduce emissions, one of its most misleading compromises has been the use of exhaust gas cleaning systems—commonly known as scrubbers.

Installed on vessels to remove sulphur oxides from the exhaust of heavy fuel oil (HFO), scrubbers allow ships to continue burning the cheapest and dirtiest fuel available, all while claiming to meet environmental standards.

The Science is Clear

The shipping industry emits vast quantities of air pollutants that threaten human health and the environment. To address this, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) introduced sulphur limits in marine fuels.

Rather than switching to cleaner fuels, many shipowners opted for scrubbers, enabling them to continue burning toxic HFO while ""cleaning"" the exhaust gases from sulphur oxides, they shift the pollution from the air to the sea.

Scrubber washwater contains a toxic cocktail of heavy metals (nickel, vanadium, copper), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and acidic compounds.

Peer-reviewed research by trusted institutions (e.g. Chalmers paper in Nature Sustainability, Jalkanen et al. 2024, Zapata Restrepo et al. 2024, Genitsaris et al. 2023, Picone et al. 2023), government studies (e.g. Schmolke et al. 2020, EU EMERGE 2021, BSH-ImpEx 2023) — have repeatedly shown that scrubber washwater is toxic to marine life.

ImpEx Project found that many washwater samples caused high to extreme toxicity and even mutagenic effects. Studies found measurable effects on biodiversity, reproduction, and nutrient cycles in the marine food web even at dilutions of just 1.5% (e.g. EU EMERGE project).

Despite claims from the scrubber lobby that washwater quickly disperses, research shows that discharges especially were it amasses like in harbours, estuaries, and busy shipping lanes the toxics accumulate in sediments over time, degrade water quality, and harm sensitive ecosystems.

Some pollutants, like PAHs and heavy metals, persist in the environment and bioaccumulate even in the food chain—eventually ending up on our plates.

Studies show both acute and chronic toxicity, including mutagenicity. Multiple studies show significant effects on zooplankton, microalgae, cyanobacteria, and fish.

The German Environment Agency has recently concluded that scrubber washwater discharge ""poses an unacceptable risk.""

The Legal Landscape of Scrubbers

The continued use of scrubbers is also legally dubious.

Under the EU Water Framework Directive (Article 4), member states are legally obliged to prevent deterioration of their water bodies and reduce pollution from priority hazardous substances—many of which are found in scrubber discharge.

Also, the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (e.g. Article 1) requires a precautionary approach to marine protection. Permitting scrubber use, especially nearshore, flies in the face of these obligations.

Similarly, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS, Article 195) requires states to protect the marine environment from all sources of pollution. States must ensure that damage or hazards are not shifted, directly or indirectly, from one area to another, nor that one type of pollution is merely transformed into another.

Allowing ships to dump toxic washwater in sensitive marine areas raises serious questions about whether these obligations are being met.

MARPOL Annex VI (Regulation 4.4) permits the use of ""equivalent"" technologies only under the condition that they do not impair or damage the environment, human health, property, or the resources of other States.

Given the documented environmental risks associated with scrubber discharges, it is difficult to see how their use can be considered compliant with this provision.

Recent Bans on Scrubber Washwater Discharges

Given the limited pace of action by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) as the global regulator of shipping, it is both legitimate and necessary for individual states or regional bodies, like OSPAR, to adopt complementary measures addressing the use of scrubbers.

The science is clear. The legal obligations are binding. And cleaner alternatives exist.

It's no surprise, then, that a growing number of regions are taking action. E.g. Denmark, Finland and Sweden are already banning scrubber washwater discharges in its territorial waters since summer 2025.

Several major ports and regional authorities have already imposed their own restrictions. Recently, e.g. the OSPAR Commission for the North-East Atlantic decided to prohibit the discharge of scrubber washwater in internal waters from 2027 onwards.

This is a policy wave that's gaining momentum—and for good reason.

It's time for governments, regional regulators, and port authorities around the globe to follow the lead of Denmark and others by implementing full bans on scrubber washwater discharges.

Neglecting Peer-Reviewed Science

Despite a growing body of peer-reviewed evidence and an increasing number of regulatory restrictions around the world, the industry's main lobby group continues to downplay scientific findings to defend the status quo.

That an organization naming itself the Clean Shipping Alliance is devoted to defending scrubbers and the continued use of heavy fuel oil is, at best, ironic. The group's name suggests a commitment to clean seas, yet its actions support the prolonged use of the dirtiest fuels available.

While the extent of environmental harm from scrubber discharges can be debated, there is no serious argument that this practice represents clean, cleaner or by any means sustainable shipping.

Clean Shipping Alliances criticism to OSPAR's decision to ban scrubber washwater discharge relies on misleading timelines, a denial of peer-reviewed science and a legal misinterpretation of OSPAR's rights and obligations under environmental law.

Their cherry-picked studies and often industry-funded research with known limitations, typically assumes high dilution, short exposure times, and ignore cumulative or long-term effects.

In a Nutshell

Scrubbers exist to protect the profits of companies unwilling to invest in cleaner alternatives, not to protect the environment or public health.

Not only at the expense of human health and the environment but also at the expense of competitors that switch to cleaner fuels. If we see two ships next to each other the one with the scrubber is always worse for the environment, because the ship without scrubber complies with regulation by using a less toxic fuel and therefore posing decreased risk to health and nature.

Wasaline said the route is ""the world's first green shipping corridor in operation"", cutting the carbon emissions that cause dangerous climate change.
""We are currently operating with biogas and HVO (hydrotreated vegetable oil), so we are operating completely carbon neutral,"" Teir said.
The global shipping industry, which transports nearly 90 percent of the world's cargo and still relies heavily on fossil fuels, is responsible for around two to three percent of global greenhouse gas emissions each year.
""The EU already has its system in place, while China is signalling plans for its own programs, adding complexity to global shipping,"" he told AFP in an email.","In Finland, one of the world's first large passenger ferries to go carbon neutral aims to set the global standard for sustainable shipping, even as efforts to slash the industry's emissions face a backlash.

No smoke billowed from the stacks of the Aurora Botnia, a 150-meter (492-foot) cargo and passenger ferry that can transport around 900 people, as it quietly crossed the narrow Gulf of Bothnia from Vaasa in Finland to Umea in Sweden, the world's northernmost year-round shipping and passenger traffic route.

Advt

The hybrid ferry runs partly on batteries and in August, its liquified natural gas (LNG) was replaced with biofuels, making it one of the world's first larger carbon-neutral ferries, operator Wasaline's technical director Jonas Teir told AFP as he gave a tour of the engine room.

Wasaline said the route is ""the world's first green shipping corridor in operation"", cutting the carbon emissions that cause dangerous climate change.

""We are currently operating with biogas and HVO (hydrotreated vegetable oil), so we are operating completely carbon neutral,"" Teir said.

""We are also installing more battery capacity which will reduce the need for fuel and other resources for energy,"" he said, explaining that more battery power would increase capacity from today's 2.2 MWh to 12.6 MWh.

That will make it the largest marine battery hybrid system in operation globally.

New European Union rules on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and increasing renewable and low-emission fuels in the maritime sector came into force this year.

Member states of the International Maritime Organization were also set to formally adopt the Net Zero Framework -- the first global carbon-pricing system -- on October 17, but the vote was postponed by a year after the United States opposed the carbon-cutting plan and threatened to impose sanctions against countries backing it.

The global shipping industry, which transports nearly 90 percent of the world's cargo and still relies heavily on fossil fuels, is responsible for around two to three percent of global greenhouse gas emissions each year.

Pooling carbon deficit

Wasaline benefited from its collaboration with several large nearby tech and energy companies keen to test out their cutting edge emission-reduction technology on the vessel, ""a win-win situation for all parties involved"", Teir said.

Advt

""We are one of the smaller shipping companies in the world, so being a forerunner is also something that sets a little bit of a benchmark for the bigger ones,"" he added.

Because the ferry has met EU climate targets, it can use a new EU mechanism allowing it to sell the carbon emissions it ""saved"" to another shipping company, which can then mark it down as its own emission reduction.

""The pooling mechanism makes it economically viable to run 100 percent on biofuels,"" Teir said.

Fanny Devaux, deputy director of shipping at European NGO Transport & Environment, said Aurora Botnia demonstrated ""real progress in energy efficiency and electrification"".

But the shipping industry needs to steer away from biofuels, she said.

""There just isn't enough sustainable biowaste to power all the ships in the world.""

""The ultimate goal must be to replace fossil fuels with scalable fuels that can achieve deep, verifiable emission reductions without harming ecosystems,"" she said, citing e-fuels such as e-methanol, e-ammonia, and hydrogen made from renewable electricity.

Reducing energy consumption ""through operational and technical efficiency"" remained the most important rule in the energy transition, Devaux stressed.

Docking in the small Swedish port of Umea where the open sea glittered, still ice-free in October, captain Johannes Sjoholm said it felt like he was ""part of something bigger"" by ""challenging the old systems"".

""We hope to be a kind of pilot project for others to see and notice that it is possible to do this this way,"" he said.

Constraints

According to Hakan Agnevall, CEO of ship engine builder Wartsila, the postponed IMO vote ""opens the door to a fragmented landscape of carbon pricing mechanisms introduced by individual regions and countries"".

""The EU already has its system in place, while China is signalling plans for its own programs, adding complexity to global shipping,"" he told AFP in an email.

Devaux said the postponed vote ""introduces significant uncertainty for the shipping industry and clean tech investors"".

Wartsila is currently developing new engines for more climate-friendly fuels and energy efficient technology.

""We actually have the technologies. But getting a sufficient amount of fuels, making the whole equation financially viable, those are the biggest constraints right now,"" he said.","https://etimg.etb2bimg.com/thumb/msid-124757719,imgsize-60310,width-1200,height=627,overlay-etinfra,resizemode-75/news/ports-shipping/finnish-carbon-neutral-ferry-sets-global-benchmark-for-sustainable-shipping.jpg",N,,2025-10-23 10:22:22.496267

The delay, agreed during last week’s Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) meeting in London, may slow global climate progress and hinder efforts to decarbonise the maritime sector.

The NZF was intended to create a global regulatory base for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from shipping, including a fuel standard and a pricing mechanism. ESPO described the postponement as a missed opportunity to accelerate the transition to clean fuels and warned that it could extend the existing fragmentation caused by differing regional regulations.

According to ESPO, the decision comes despite strong calls from across the industry for a unified global approach that would ensure predictability and a level playing field. The organisation stated that the delay risks weakening the credibility of international climate leadership in the maritime sector.

ESPO welcomed the European Commission’s new strategy to promote a global clean and resilient transition, aimed at boosting climate action, clean technology, and sustainable value chains. To maintain progress, ESPO urged the Commission to adopt several measures, including tax exemptions for electricity used by ships at berth and zero-carbon fuels, subsidies and carbon contracts for difference to narrow the price gap with fossil fuels, and targeted use of EU Emissions Trading System revenues for port infrastructure supporting clean energy.

ESPO emphasised that the postponement should not be seen as cancellation, acknowledging that the IMO’s technical work continues. It called on governments, industry, and civil society to stay engaged in developing an ambitious and workable framework.

In the meantime, ESPO asked the European Commission to mitigate the negative effects of the EU’s regional measures on business competitiveness and to prepare for alignment between EU and future IMO regulations.

Standing together as a bloc, African nations can play a decisive role in shaping the future of global shipping.
With abundant geothermal, wind, solar, and hydro resources, Kenya holds a strategic advantage in the emerging green hydrogen economy.
A recent Green Hydrogen Baseline Study confirmed that Kenya has sufficient renewable energy to support large-scale hydrogen production without compromising domestic electricity supply, and identified high potential for green hydrogen to support fertiliser production and other derivatives in the short to medium term.
Clean shipping fuels, like green hydrogen and its derivatives, are rapidly emerging as key solutions for decarbonising global shipping.","With much of Africa’s trade flowing through its ports, the continent stands to benefit significantly from a transition to cleaner, more sustainable shipping.

Yet, Africa’s participation in the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) – the body that sets the rules for global shipping – remains limited and comparatively weaker than our engagement in climate negotiations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).

This October is Africa’s moment to articulate its ambitions and take decisive climate action. The IMO member States will vote on the Net-Zero Framework, a landmark regulatory package under the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL) that aims to make global shipping cleaner and eventually reach zero emissions by 2050.

If adopted, this regulatory package will signal to markets and investors that the age of fossil-fueled shipping is drawing to a close.

For African countries, this is more than a climate milestone – it is an economic opportunity. Cleaner shipping could open new markets, attract investment, and create green jobs across African ports and the maritime industry.

But this will only happen if African countries engage proactively, articulate their ambition clearly, and act decisively.

As the global shipping takes its push toward decarbonization, Africa stands at the cusp of a once-in-a-generation opportunity to lead in producing the clean fuels the sector will soon depend on.

From Kenya, where over 90% of electricity is generated from renewable sources such as geothermal and wind, to Namibia and South Africa, whose wide-open spaces offer some of the best solar energy conditions, Africa has the potential to become a global hub for clean fuel production.

But there’s an even stronger reason to double down on renewables: the rise of e-fuels.

e-fuels – such as green hydrogen, ammonia, and methanol – are made using renewable electricity and are essential to powering large vessels that cannot easily operate on batteries.

As the global shipping industry races to find sustainable fuel alternatives, countries rich in renewable energy potential could become major suppliers of these next-generation fuels.

For Africa, this transition could be transformative. The global push to decarbonise shipping can serve not only as a climate solution but also as a catalyst for Africa’s green industrialisation.

The global shipping industry moves almost 90% of global trade and emits about 3% of total greenhouse gas emissions, more than most countries. Cutting these emissions is no longer a choice; it is a necessity.

The IMO’s Net-Zero Framework represents a critical step forward – a blueprint for creating a predictable policy environment that can unlock investment in zero- and near-zero-emission fuels and technologies.

For African economies, this could mean a surge in global demand for the very products our renewable potential can produce.

Beyond exports, these fuels could also power domestic industries, reduce dependence on fossil fuel imports, and create green jobs in energy, engineering, and transport.

Timing, however, is of the essence. If the Net-Zero Framework is delayed or watered down, investors may look elsewhere. Africa’s window of opportunity is open now – but it won’t stay open forever.

Historically, African states have played a modest role in shaping international maritime policies. Yet the upcoming IMO vote presents a unique chance to change that.

By supporting a strong, equitable Net-Zero Framework, African countries can help steer the global transition while positioning themselves to benefit from it.

Standing together as a bloc, African nations can play a decisive role in shaping the future of global shipping.

In multilateral negotiations, coalitions are essential – they amplify the voices of developing countries and help build influence where individual states might struggle.

For example, in climate negotiations under the UNFCCC, the African Group of Negotiators has been instrumental in developing and advancing common African positions.

A similar platform may be needed for IMO negotiations to ensure that Africa’s priorities, such as technology transfer, capacity building, access to funding, fair representation, and a Just and Equitable Transition, are fully reflected.

Early, united support would send a powerful message: Africa is not waiting to be helped; it is ready to lead.

The Ports of Mombasa and Lamu serve as key gateways for Eastern Africa’s trade, while the country’s investments in wind, solar, and geothermal make it a strong candidate for future e-fuel production hubs.

Yet environmental maritime affairs have remained peripheral in Kenya’s public and policy discourse. With abundant geothermal, wind, solar, and hydro resources, Kenya holds a strategic advantage in the emerging green hydrogen economy.

The government’s Green Hydrogen Strategy and Roadmap, launched in September 2023, sets a clear course for leveraging green hydrogen as a key driver of the energy transition, starting with pilot projects in 2025.

A recent Green Hydrogen Baseline Study confirmed that Kenya has sufficient renewable energy to support large-scale hydrogen production without compromising domestic electricity supply, and identified high potential for green hydrogen to support fertiliser production and other derivatives in the short to medium term.

In this context, environmental maritime affairs must be brought into the fold. Clean shipping fuels, like green hydrogen and its derivatives, are rapidly emerging as key solutions for decarbonising global shipping.

Civil society, academic institutions, and the private sector all have a role to play in elevating the maritime sector as a national priority and ensuring that it is integrated into the broader energy transition pathway.",https://assets.citizen.digital/160665/conversions/TNRG4PXBPVITBOJQGOF6IVJBFE-og_image.webp,N,,2025-10-23 05:16:40.825320

The most important thing to take away from this first part of MEPC/ES.2 may be more subtle than explicit.
Applying the tacit procedure has been the norm of the organisation for the past 50 years when MARPOL or SOLAS have been amended.","Following the decision by IMO Member States to delay the planned adoption of the Net-Zero Framework for one year in a vote during the last day of Marine Environment Protection Committee, 2nd extraordinary session MEPC/ES.2 (14 to 17 October 2025), BIMCO expects that a member state will ask the IMO Secretary General to circulate, with a view to adopt at MEPC 84 in the spring of 2026, the three “hostage” amendments to MARPOL Annex VI bundled with the Net-Zero Framework (NZF).

As explained by BIMCO, this way, the amendments would not be left hanging in a vacuum awaiting the resumption of the MEPC/ES.2 one year from now. These are the Northeast Atlantic ECA, multi-engine operation protocols for Regulation 13 and changes to the schedule of the data collection system (DCS). These amendments are considered rather uncontroversial.

BIMCO also expects that MEPC 84 will need to deal with arranging the continuation of MEPC/ES.2. This is because the dates in the draft legal text will already need to be changed due to the delay in adoption. If the other three bundled amendments are adopted at MEPC 84, they will need to be removed from the draft legal text before the continued MEPC/ES.2. There is also the issue of figuring out what can realistically be adopted in terms of the NZF itself.

In this regard, BIMCO finds it essential that any modification of the NZF is done in such a way as to ensure that the tacit acceptance procedure is applied to its entry into force criteria once it comes to being adopted. At the time of writing, It is difficult to ascertain which modifications will be needed, but clearly, the economic element part is first in line to be reconsidered.

The most important thing to take away from this first part of MEPC/ES.2 may be more subtle than explicit. The meeting never decided on application of the explicit acceptance procedure instead of the tacit acceptance procedure. Applying the tacit procedure has been the norm of the organisation for the past 50 years when MARPOL or SOLAS have been amended.

Not taking a decision does not set a precedent. A continued well-functioning IMO is of paramount importance to the global shipping industry.

The shipping industry, which had been seeking a consistent regulatory environment and level playing field, was largely supportive of the plan.
Then, in April, the Trump administration abruptly withdrew from IMO negotiations.

And the collapse of IMO negotiations rings as a warning about the fragility of international cooperation.","With relatively little fanfare, the first-ever global carbon tax was poised to be formally adopted as an international agreement this year.

The International Maritime Organization, or IMO, the United Nations agency overseeing global shipping, had drafted a net-zero framework to move the sector toward cleaner fuels — a crucial step in the energy transition, since the industry that handles around 90 percent of global trade also accounts for 3 percent of the world’s emissions.

The framework would require shippers to pay a fee per ton of greenhouse gas emissions if their emissions rose above a certain threshold. The fees would then be pooled into a fund and distributed to support the development and uptake of alternative fuels and decarbonization in developing countries. The shipping industry, which had been seeking a consistent regulatory environment and level playing field, was largely supportive of the plan. So were the vast majority of U.N. member countries.

Then, in April, the Trump administration abruptly withdrew from IMO negotiations. As a vote over the framework approached this month, the administration began pressuring other nations to abandon the deal. The administration also released a statement, warning that the U.S. was considering additional tariffs, visa restrictions, additional port fees, and sanctions on officials from countries that voted for the framework. President Trump himself took to Truth Social, calling the proposal a “global green new scam tax on shipping.”

The campaign succeeded. Last week, at the tail end of negotiations, Saudi Arabia abruptly called for a vote to adjourn the IMO meeting for one year without making a decision on the net-zero framework. Since IMO rules dictate that a call to adjourn precedes all other considerations, the proposed delay was voted on immediately and passed with 57 countries in favor and 49 against. (Twenty-one countries abstained from the vote.) That means that it will be another year, at least, before the framework can be officially inked.

Close observers of the IMO’s decarbonization efforts told Grist that U.S. obstruction was a decisive factor in preventing the framework’s adoption.

“It’s fair to say that the retaliatory measures and punitive threats that were shared by the U.S. administration in advance of the meetings played their part,” said Em Fenton, a senior director at Opportunity Green, a U.K.-based climate group that has been closely tracking the IMO negotiations. “The outcome last week is a devastating blow for climate multilateralism.”

The IMO has been inching toward emissions rules for several years, but the effort ramped up in 2023 when the agency’s 176 member countries agreed to a greenhouse gas strategy that would commit them to net-zero emissions by about 2050. In order to reach that goal, countries began negotiations on legally binding measures that included a standard capping the carbon-intensity of fuel used by shipping companies, as well as an economic measure to enforce that standard, which could take the form of a levy or carbon trading mechanism.

On the economic measure, countries were split. An ambitious coalition of more than 64 countries, including European Union countries, the United Kingdom, Pacific and Caribbean nations, and African countries, proposed a relatively high flat tax on all maritime emissions. Under their proposal, every ton of their greenhouse gas emissions would be priced at the same level across the board. Another set of countries led by China, however, were in favor of a carbon trading mechanism that allowed countries to offset their emissions through carbon credits. (China and other emerging economies are large exporters, and a flat fee, they argued, would hurt businesses and reduce their competitiveness.)

Ultimately, the countries landed on a compromise with a two-tier system: High emitters in the top tier could engage in some amount of carbon trading. Those in the bottom tier would pay the levy based on a fee per ton of emissions. And those who comply with the zero or near-zero emissions fuel requirements would receive financial rewards. This approach became the net-zero framework that was supposed to be voted into effect this year.

The shipping industry largely welcomed the framework. For one, the industry has had record profits in recent years. A report by Opportunity Green found that 139 of the world’s largest shipping companies, which make up more than 90 percent of the global fleet, made $340 billion in profits from 2019 to 2023. The 10 largest companies were effectively taxed at less than 10 percent on average — far lower than the average global corporation tax rate of 21.5 percent.

The industry was also eager for regulatory certainty. Ahead of the meeting last week, a group of trade organizations representing the shipping industry issued a statement calling for the adoption of the framework. “Only global rules will decarbonize a global industry,” they noted. “Without the framework, shipping would risk a growing patchwork of unilateral regulations, increasing costs without effectively contributing to decarbonization.”

With the framework now in jeopardy, the path forward is unclear. Although the shipping talks won’t resume for another year, Fenton said countries should push for additional technical clarity during other interim meetings to reach a consensus and ensure the framework is adopted next year.

Meanwhile, cities and ports across the world have been taking steps to green their infrastructure. Alisa Kreynes, a director of the ports and shipping program at C40, a global network of mayors taking climate action, pointed to various initiatives already underway to reduce carbon emissions from the shipping industry. Cities have built green shipping corridors, which are trade routes where ports and other partners work together to transition to zero or near-zero emission fuels. Ports have also begun establishing stricter emission standards for trucks, and supported the development of offshore wind.

“The way we are reacting is that cities continue to deliver a just maritime transition, despite what happened at the IMO last week,” Kreynes said. “The cities will continue to push forward with advancing equitable port and shipping decarbonization.”

But those measures won’t put a significant dent in the industry’s primary source of emissions, which is the massive, fuel-hungry boats that crisscross the globe delivering goods. And the collapse of IMO negotiations rings as a warning about the fragility of international cooperation. The dynamic could continue at COP30, the international climate conference taking place in Belém, Brazil, next month.

“The sort of playbook of delay-and-obfuscate is more likely to be on the table and visible at COP30 than it would have been if it had not prevailed here at the IMO,” said Fenton. “And that is hugely disappointing.”",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ships-barge-china.jpg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2025-10-23 05:16:50.637508

The green transformation of the shipping industry has become a global consensus.

IMO has explicitly required ships over 5,000 mt to reduce emissions in phases, aiming for net-zero emissions by 2050. Against this backdrop,methanol energy has emerged as a key solution due to its unique advantages: it serves as a coal-based clean fuel and can be produced on a large scale by coupling hydrogen from wind and solar power with carbon dioxide emitted during coal chemical processes, enabling zero-carbon, efficient utilization of coal. It also features easy storage and convenient transportation,and has been rated by Longspur Research as ""one of the best choices for green marine fuels.""

As an international shipping hub, Shanghai is accelerating its efforts to seize the initiative in this transformation. The""Shanghai Action Plan for Promoting Green Transformation of International Shipping Fuels,""released in October 2024, proposes the establishment of a coordinated domestic and international green fuel supply system for shipping by 2030, with the initial construction of a green fuel bunkering service center. Leveraging its advantage of being the world's top container port for 15 consecutive years, Shanghai Port has taken the lead in China in deploying the entire industry chain for green marine methanol, providing a solid industrial foundation for the maiden voyage of the ""Yuan Chun 001.""

The technical performance of the ""Yuan Chun 001"" demonstrates significant competitive advantages.

The ship is equipped with a methanol-hydrogen electric system independently developed by Yuan Cheng New Energy Commercial Vehicle.Based on actual tests and comparisons: compared to traditional diesel-powered ships, energy costs are reduced by 42%, and carbon emissions are cut by 98%, nearly achieving zero-carbon operation; compared to pure electric ships, under the premise of enjoying the same national policy subsidies, the purchase cost is reduced by 24%, energy costs are lowered by 11.5%, and the driving range is increased to 1,500 km, effectively addressing the short driving range issue of pure electric vessels.

This collaboration is the result of strategic synergy between Shanghai Port Group and Geely Holding: Geely Holding has been deeply involved in the methanol field for over 20 years, establishing a comprehensive layout across the entire industry chain—from methanol production and refueling to application. In Shanghai, batches of methanol-electric vehicles have been deployed, accompanied by the construction of methanol refueling stations, and Jiading District has introduced a specialized plan to regulate the supervision of these stations. Leveraging its port operation experience and geographical advantages, Shanghai Port Group provides the necessary scenarios for technology implementation. Both parties have committed to further collaboration in advancing the establishment of green methanol standards, building refueling networks, and coordinating the capacity of methanol-electric vessels on inland waterways, accelerating the promotion of the industrial ecosystem.

The commercial validation of methanol-electric technology has achieved multi-scenario coverage.

In the road transport sector, over 50,000 methanol-electric vehicles have been deployed, accumulating a total mileage of over 23 billion kilometers, fully demonstrating their economic efficiency, safety, and reliability. Several car models under the Yuan Cheng brand have been included in the vehicle purchase tax exemption catalog. The technology has now expanded into areas such as engineering machinery and power generation units, forming a multi-dimensional green energy application matrix.

The maiden voyage of the ""Yuan Chun 001"" marks the official implementation of a three-dimensional green logistics solution based on methanol-electric technology, providing a replicable model for the transformation of the shipping industry. Wang Zhaoxing, Senior Vice President of Geely Holding Group, stated that both parties will leverage technological innovation and industrial collaboration to build a green and sustainable development model for liquid new energy. This ""China model"" not only contributes to China's energy independence but also offers ""Chinese wisdom"" and ""Chinese solutions"" for the global green transition of shipping.",https://static.metal.com/common.metal.com/images/header-en/smm-logo.png,N,,2025-10-23 10:23:04.579467

The postponement, agreed at last week’s Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) meeting in London, is seen as a setback that could slow global climate ambition and hinder progress toward maritime decarbonisation.

Missed Opportunity for Global Climate Leadership

The NZF was expected to establish a unified global foundation for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from shipping through measures such as a fuel standard and a carbon pricing mechanism. ESPO described the delay as a missed opportunity to speed up the transition to clean fuels and warned that it could exacerbate regulatory fragmentation and unfair competition between regions.

“The postponement risks creating a standstill in global climate ambition and undermines the rare moment of convergence we have seen across the maritime sector,” ESPO stated, emphasizing that a coordinated global framework was essential for predictability and a level playing field across the supply chain.

ESPO’s Call for Continued Action in Europe

While expressing disappointment, ESPO welcomed the European Commission’s new strategy for a clean and resilient transition, which aims to boost political momentum, support green technologies, and strengthen global partnerships for sustainable value chains.

To sustain progress and encourage the use of clean fuels, ESPO urged the Commission to take tangible steps, including:

Introducing tax exemptions for electricity used by ships at berth and for zero-carbon fuels such as green methanol, ammonia, and hydrogen.

Providing subsidies and carbon contracts for difference (CCfDs) to narrow the cost gap between fossil and sustainable fuels.

Allocating EU ETS revenues to build port infrastructure for clean fuel bunkering and onshore power supply (OPS).

Creating incentives for fuel demand to encourage producers and suppliers to invest in capacity expansion.

Maintaining Momentum Despite Delay

ESPO stressed that the delay should not be mistaken for abandonment of the framework. The organisation acknowledged that the IMO’s technical work continues and urged governments, industry, and civil society to remain committed and engaged in shaping a workable and ambitious global solution.

Meanwhile, ESPO called on the European Commission to address the unintended side effects of regional regulations, such as business leakage and reduced competitiveness of European ports, until a global alignment is achieved.

Reaffirming its commitment to climate action, ESPO called on the European Commission, EU Member States, and maritime stakeholders to keep pressing for a strong global regulatory framework under the IMO. “Only through robust, coordinated global regulation can international shipping remain on a credible path toward net-zero emissions,” ESPO concluded.

Wasaline said the route is ""the world's first green shipping corridor in operation"", cutting the carbon emissions that cause dangerous climate change.
""We are currently operating with biogas and HVO (hydrotreated vegetable oil), so we are operating completely carbon neutral,"" Teir said.
The global shipping industry, which transports nearly 90 percent of the world's cargo and still relies heavily on fossil fuels, is responsible for around two to three percent of global greenhouse gas emissions each year.
""The EU already has its system in place, while China is signalling plans for its own programs, adding complexity to global shipping,"" he told AFP in an email.","In Finland, one of the world's first large passenger ferries to go carbon neutral aims to set the global standard for sustainable shipping, even as efforts to slash the industry's emissions face a backlash.

No smoke billowed from the stacks of the Aurora Botnia, a 150-meter (492-foot) cargo and passenger ferry that can transport around 900 people, as it quietly crossed the narrow Gulf of Bothnia from Vaasa in Finland to Umea in Sweden, the world's northernmost year-round shipping and passenger traffic route.

The hybrid ferry runs partly on batteries and in August, its liquified natural gas (LNG) was replaced with biofuels, making it one of the world's first larger carbon-neutral ferries, operator Wasaline's technical director Jonas Teir told AFP as he gave a tour of the engine room.

Wasaline said the route is ""the world's first green shipping corridor in operation"", cutting the carbon emissions that cause dangerous climate change.

""We are currently operating with biogas and HVO (hydrotreated vegetable oil), so we are operating completely carbon neutral,"" Teir said.

""We are also installing more battery capacity which will reduce the need for fuel and other resources for energy,"" he said, explaining that more battery power would increase capacity from today's 2.2 MWh to 12.6 MWh.

That will make it the largest marine battery hybrid system in operation globally.

New European Union rules on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and increasing renewable and low-emission fuels in the maritime sector came into force this year.

Member states of the International Maritime Organization were also set to formally adopt the Net Zero Framework -- the first global carbon-pricing system -- on October 17, but the vote was postponed by a year after the United States opposed the carbon-cutting plan and threatened to impose sanctions against countries backing it.

The global shipping industry, which transports nearly 90 percent of the world's cargo and still relies heavily on fossil fuels, is responsible for around two to three percent of global greenhouse gas emissions each year.

- Pooling carbon deficit -

Wasaline benefited from its collaboration with several large nearby tech and energy companies keen to test out their cutting edge emission-reduction technology on the vessel, ""a win-win situation for all parties involved"", Teir said.

""We are one of the smaller shipping companies in the world, so being a forerunner is also something that sets a little bit of a benchmark for the bigger ones,"" he added.

Because the ferry has met EU climate targets, it can use a new EU mechanism allowing it to sell the carbon emissions it ""saved"" to another shipping company, which can then mark it down as its own emission reduction.

""The pooling mechanism makes it economically viable to run 100 percent on biofuels,"" Teir said.

Fanny Devaux, deputy director of shipping at European NGO Transport & Environment, said Aurora Botnia demonstrated ""real progress in energy efficiency and electrification"".

But the shipping industry needs to steer away from biofuels, she said.

""There just isn't enough sustainable biowaste to power all the ships in the world.""

""The ultimate goal must be to replace fossil fuels with scalable fuels that can achieve deep, verifiable emission reductions without harming ecosystems,"" she said, citing e-fuels such as e-methanol, e-ammonia, and hydrogen made from renewable electricity.

Reducing energy consumption ""through operational and technical efficiency"" remained the most important rule in the energy transition, Devaux stressed.

Docking in the small Swedish port of Umea where the open sea glittered, still ice-free in October, captain Johannes Sjoholm said it felt like he was ""part of something bigger"" by ""challenging the old systems"".

""We hope to be a kind of pilot project for others to see and notice that it is possible to do this this way,"" he said.

- Constraints -

According to Hakan Agnevall, CEO of ship engine builder Wartsila, the postponed IMO vote ""opens the door to a fragmented landscape of carbon pricing mechanisms introduced by individual regions and countries"".

""The EU already has its system in place, while China is signalling plans for its own programs, adding complexity to global shipping,"" he told AFP in an email.

Devaux said the postponed vote ""introduces significant uncertainty for the shipping industry and clean tech investors"".

Wartsila is currently developing new engines for more climate-friendly fuels and energy efficient technology.

""We actually have the technologies. But getting a sufficient amount of fuels, making the whole equation financially viable, those are the biggest constraints right now,"" he said.

The NZF had been in the works for several years and had gained wide consensus before IMO’s recent decision. The decision creates considerable uncertainty in the sector, coming amid intense U.S. opposition that appears unlikely to wane, and the MEPC continues to pursue adoption of the NZF.

Key Takeaways

The MEPC deferred a decision to make the NZF legally binding until October 2026

The U.S. vehemently opposed adoption of the NZF, threatening to impose trade, port, and other restrictions on countries supporting the measure

The MEPC will continue work to define fundamental elements of the NZF and achieve consensus on its adoption

European Union (EU) measures regulating shipping GHG emissions will remain in place, and other countries may consider similar measures

The IMO decision creates considerable regulatory uncertainty for stakeholders across the shipping supply chain, and they should prepare to engage policymakers on several fronts

Background

The NZF would establish a legally binding regulatory framework to achieve net-zero GHG emissions ""by or around, i.e. close to, 2050,"" as articulated in the 2023 IMO Strategy on Reduction of GHG Emissions from Ships, agreed by the MEPC in July 2023. If adopted, the NZF would be included as a new chapter 5 in Annex VI to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL).

The NZF combines a global fuel standard and GHG emissions pricing mechanism applicable to ships over 5,000 gross tonnage. The scheme endorsed by the MEPC in April creates two tiers of GHG fuel intensity (GFI) targets, a Base Target (BT) and a more stringent Direct Compliance Target (DCT). In simplified terms, ships that fail to meet the targets generate ""compliance deficits"" and would be required to acquire Remedial Units (RUs), while ships that exceed the DCT could generate bankable Surplus Units (SUs). RUs would be acquired by making ""pricing contributions"" to a yet-to-be-established IMO Net-Zero Fund. Ships that use ""Zero or Near-Zero GHG emission technologies, fuels and/or energy sources"" (ZNZs) would be eligible to receive ""Rewards"" (annual compensation) from the IMO Net-Zero Fund.

Recent IMO Actions

The MEPC approved the text of the NZF at its 83rd meeting in April (MEPC 83) and had targeted formal approval needed to make it legally binding at its extraordinary session held last week (October 14-17). However, support for the NZF weakened in the intervening months amid U.S. threats of trade and other retaliation measures against countries supporting the measure. The MEPC ultimately adopted a resolution to adjourn the ES until October 2026 without approving the NZF.

In a statement issued after the extraordinary session, the MEPC affirmed its intention to continue work on developing NZF implementation guidelines to further define fundamental aspects of the scheme and achieve consensus on adopting the measure. Work to develop these guidelines is already beginning at this week's meeting of the Intersessional Working Group on the Reduction of Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Ships.

The U.S. first signaled its ""unequivocal"" opposition to the NZF on April 9, 2025, when it announced its withdrawal from MEPC 83, urging other governments to ""reconsider"" their support for the agreement and warning it could consider ""reciprocal measures."" The U.S. escalated these threats in a joint statement issued August 12, 2025, by the U.S. Departments of State, Transportation, Energy, and Commerce, and ultimately detailed retaliatory measures it planned to consider in a policy statement issued on the eve of last week's MEPC ES, including targeted port access and visa restrictions, sanctions, penalties, and port fees. The U.S. has made clear its intent to ""levy these remedies against nations that sponsor this European-led neocolonial export of global climate regulations.""

IMO adoption of the NZF would have triggered a process to consider changes to European Union (EU) measures regulating shipping GHGs - the Emissions Trading System (ETS) (Directive (EU) 2023/959) and FuelEU Maritime regulation (Regulation (EU) 2023/1805). The decision to postpone consideration of the NZF means these measures remain intact and, more broadly, that the shipping industry will continue to face a patchwork of regional and/or country-specific regulations governing GHG emissions and maritime fuel.

What’s Next

Going forward, ship owners, charterers, and other supply-chain stakeholders, including fuel suppliers and ship builders, should monitor developments closely and engage on multiple fronts, including:

IMO/MEPC efforts to achieve consensus on the NZF, which could require negotiating significant changes, likely with significant U.S. input;

IMO/MEPC efforts to better define key elements of the NZF through implementation guidelines to be developed by IMO bodies in the coming months;

U.S. efforts to gain leverage over NZF negotiations through a variety of trade or punitive measures; and

Efforts in other regions and countries, including the EU, to develop and/implement measures to regulate GHG emissions from ships that visit their ports.

Finally, companies in other sectors should note that the Trump administration's approach to the NZF mirrors its broader pattern of leveraging international environmental disputes to advance domestic industrial priorities and leverage bilateral trade. As such, companies affected by other international schemes, such as the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), should consider how the Trump administration's approach to the NZF may inform its approach to these schemes.",https://www.bdlaw.com/content/themes/beveridge-theme/img/og-default.jpg,N,,2025-10-22 22:20:35.512541

The report, which was undertaken by SMM, a major international maritime trade fair set to take place in Hamburg next year, found that high energy costs and increasing regulatory burden are among the top issues for maritime firms, with the shortage of skilled professionals at the top of this list.

Data-driven solutions are much in demand across the industry, growing in importance by 13% compared to the previous year, with interest in artificial intelligence solutions soaring, SMM noted.

Shipowners also said that they are increasingly likely to order new ships for their fleet, with 48% saying they were either ‘likely’ or ‘very likely’ to do so, compared to 46% in 2023 and 39% in 2021.

The findings were published ahead of the IMO’s recent announcement that it will adjourn its decision on sustainable maritime fuels for one year.

Market expectations

The SMM Maritime Industry Report evaluated market participants’ expectations regarding the development of the shipping and shipbuilding segments, with the Maritime Industry Score measuring the difference between positive and negative expectations on a scale of -100 to +100.

The overall Maritime Industry Score stood at 50.5 points, indicating overall market optimism despite seeing a slight decline from 2023.

Of the key segments of the industry, shipyards registered the strongest confidence at 49.9 points, the highest level since the survey began, while suppliers remained at a high level of 64.6 points and shipowners stood at 34.4, which was ‘slightly more moderate’ than in previous surveys.

Volatile environment

“The volatile global political environment, marked by numerous conflicts which have a direct impact on the maritime world, is clearly leaving its mark,” commented Dr. Klaus Borgschulte, shipyard manager and chairman of the SMM Advisory Committee.

As well as sustainability, suppliers are seeing a sharpened focus on after-sales service and product longevity, the study found, with Hauke Schlegel, CEO at VDMA Marine Equipment and Systems noting that “quality is becoming the most important success factor.”

Our analysis indicates that the trading price of surplus units will likely be governed by market dynamics rather than biofuel cost premiums.","The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has decided to postpone the adoption of its Net-Zero Framework (NZF) for another year. This delay, while creating additional uncertainty, warrant careful examination of the proposed mechanisms. Prior to the IMO MEPC meeting, in-depth research by Rystad Energy 's maritime decarbonization specialists revealed critical gaps in the current NZF that would to be addressed to ensure an equitable and sustainable transition for the global shipping industry. The delay will now give member states time to refine ambiguous or contentious elements to produce a stronger, more implementable framework.

The research revealed a substantial disparity between projected clean-fuel availability and targeted demand, exacerbated by infrastructure constraints, which raises concerns about the feasibility of the prescribed transition timeline. Furthermore, the study exposed a persistent imbalance in the carbon-trading mechanism, with demand for Tier II remedial unit offsets expected to outstrip available surplus units through 2035. This structural deficit is anticipated to drive trading prices towards the Tier II penalty ceiling.

The research also underscores the need for careful consideration in designing the reward mechanism to prevent it from becoming a mere penalty-collection system. While the cost gap is expected to narrow as technology matures and economies of scale are achieved, a well-designed reward mechanism is crucial to incentivize sustainable practices. By addressing these critical issues, the IMO can develop a more effective and equitable NZF, ultimately supporting the global shipping industry's transition to a low-carbon future.

Decarbonizing the maritime sector is a complex challenge that goes beyond shipping, closely tied to the global shift from fossil fuels to renewables. Our findings suggests progress will likely lag behind the IMO’s current expectations due to infrastructure limits, technology readiness, and energy system interconnections. While the industry is committed, practical constraints demand a realistic approach. The IMO should use the extra year to refine the NZF into a more practical and equitable framework.

For more on the future of green shipping, listen to the recent Let’s Talk Energy episode: Shipping has a plan to go green, but will it work?

Rystad Energy recently published a detailed investigation into the NZF and its financial implications for the shipping industry's decarbonization journey. Download the report here.

The analysis leveraged our extensive cross-sector data assets, from conventional fuels to hydrogen derivatives and biofuels, alongside a comprehensive analysis of alternative-fuel fleet composition, port infrastructure and global shipyard capabilities.

Under the NZF, vessels that meet the direct target may generate Surplus Units (SUs), while non-compliant vessels will generate Remedial Units (RUs). Remedial Units are categorized in two tiers: Tier I (RU1s) for vessels that meet the base target, and Tier II (RU2s) for those that do not.

Non-compliant vessels may offset their Tier II Remedial Units by acquiring Surplus Units from compliant vessels.

Key findings from Rystad Energy’s research reveal a complex interplay between SUs and RUs within the framework. Initial projections show SUs starting at 40 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent in 2028, growing to 53 million tonnes by 2035. Simultaneously, RU2s are expected to increase significantly from 47 million tonnes to 234 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent annually by 2035. The availability ratio between the SUs and RU2s will effectively set the market-clearing price for exchanges, with Rystad Energy’s projections suggesting that demand for RU2 offsets will consistently outstrip SU supply until 2035. This supply-demand imbalance will likely drive SU trading prices close to the Tier II penalty threshold.

Our analysis indicates that the trading price of surplus units will likely be governed by market dynamics rather than biofuel cost premiums. Given the limited availability of advanced biofuels for shipping, we anticipate that SU prices will approach the Tier II penalty level of $380 per tonne of CO2 equivalent, minus transaction costs.

Junlin Yu, vice president of supply chain research, Rystad Energy

While surplus units will substantially offset Tier II penalties through 2030, this mechanism could inadvertently limit the financial incentives available for early adopters of zero-emission technologies. The real turning point comes in 2031, when surplus units become increasingly scarce, compliance requirements tighten, and shipping companies face growing emission deficits. This will trigger a sharp escalation in penalty collections, substantially boosting the Net-Zero Fund's capacity to support the industry's decarbonization efforts.

The research highlights potential challenges in the framework's design, particularly the two-year limit on banking surplus units to avoid dilution of future emission-reduction efforts, which could potentially dampen early adoption of clean technologies. This constraint stands in stark contrast to the FuelEU Maritime regulation's permanent banking allowance.

Financial projections indicate substantial growth in the IMO Net-Zero Fund, with combined Tier I and Tier II penalties expected to generate approximately $13 billion in 2028, escalating to nearly $79 billion by 2035. However, our analysis raises concerns about the framework's effectiveness in supporting the transition to zero-emission vessels, particularly in its early years.

Rystad Energy's analysis estimates the potential reward level and benchmarks it against the required reward level, which is the threshold necessary to equalize the effective costs of e-fuels and conventional fuel oil. Initially, the required reward level is substantial due to the significant cost premium associated with e-fuels, resulting in a shortfall in cost compensation from the net-zero fund until 2030, even if 100% of the fund's resources are allocated to rewards. However, as technological advancements drive cost reductions, learning effects take hold, and economies of scale are achieved, the required reward level is expected to decrease over time, ultimately yielding a substantial surplus in the fund after the required reward.

Our findings suggest that even with 100% fund allocation toward rewards, the mechanism may not adequately compensate for the cost premium of zero or near-zero emission fuels (ZNZs) until 2030. However, beyond 2030, a substantial surplus is expected to emerge in the fund, driven by the initially low uptake of ZNZs. This underscores the critical importance of carefully designing the reward mechanism to ensure it effectively catalyzes the industry's transition toward zero-emission shipping. The fund should be used to drive meaningful emissions reductions, rather than accumulating a large surplus.

The global shipping industry faces deepening uncertainty after the International Maritime Organization postponed a crucial decision on its Net-Zero Framework, creating what industry leaders describe as “decision-making paralysis” at a pivotal moment for the sector’s decarbonization.

The regulatory delay, forced through by United States opposition despite earlier approval, threatens to derail shipping’s energy transition and undermines the investment certainty that shipowners require to commit billions toward cleaner vessels and fuels. This development comes as data reveals a significant slowdown in orders for dual-fuel vessels, highlighting the tangible consequences of regulatory instability.

Key Developments: The IMO’s Delayed Decision

In an extraordinary session this October, IMO member states voted to postpone the adoption of a global emissions pricing mechanism and fuel standards that had been scheduled to take effect in 2027. The decision represents a dramatic reversal from earlier in the year when the same measures received overwhelming support.

The postponement follows what participants described as an “unprecedented campaign” against the measures, with U.S. officials accused of pressuring other countries with threats of tariffs, penalties, and visa restrictions. This opposition created a new alliance including Russia, Saudi Arabia, and other petrostates, successfully delaying the implementation until at least 2028.

IMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez expressed disappointment with the fractious nature of the discussions, stating: “It is the time to really look back at how we have approached this meeting. My plea to you is not to repeat the way we have approached this meeting for future discussions.”

Industry Impact: Decision Paralysis Sets In

The regulatory uncertainty comes at a critical juncture for maritime decarbonization. According to industry analysis, fragmented regulation is undermining progress in decarbonization and limiting investment. The report warns that without sufficient regulatory support, the global shipping industry risks falling short of its net-zero targets.

Investment Hesitation: “What’s happening right now when we meet with our customers? We see for ourselves uncertainty and uncertainty causes inaction and lack of investment,” said Lasse Krisoffersen, CEO of car carrier Wallenius Wilhelmsen.

Regulatory Volatility: Ibrahim Al Nadhairi, CEO of Asyad Shipping Company, echoed these concerns: “We wake up every morning, there’s a new regulation”. This sentiment reflects the industry’s struggle to navigate an increasingly complex and unpredictable regulatory landscape.

The consequences are tangible: data from the first ten months of 2025 shows a marked plateau in orders for dual-fuel newbuildings, as shipowners hesitate to commit to significant capital expenditures without clear regulatory signals.

The Green Fuel Challenge: Availability and Cost

Compounding the regulatory uncertainty are fundamental concerns about alternative fuel supply chains and infrastructure:

Table: Alternative Fuel Cost Comparison

The significant cost premium for green fuels creates a chicken-and-egg dilemma: shipowners are reluctant to invest in vessels without guaranteed fuel supply at viable prices, while fuel producers hesitate to scale production without sufficient vessel demand.

“The availability of alternative fuels is still limited, and the infrastructure for their production, storage, and distribution is underdeveloped,” notes a recent industry study, highlighting the interconnected challenges facing the industry.

Broader Pressures: Geopolitics and Economic Headwinds

The shipping industry’s decarbonization challenges are further complicated by wider economic and geopolitical pressures:

Trade Policy Volatility: Shifting trade policies, including recent U.S. tariff announcements, are “constantly shifting” and “very difficult to keep up with,” resulting in higher costs for businesses.

Aging Fleet Concerns: The average age of the tanker fleet is increasing, with some industry leaders warning of “graveyards of floating environmental bombs” due to older vessels often lacking proper classification and insurance.

Growth Slowdown: Global maritime trade growth is projected to stall in 2025, a sharp decline from 2024, further tightening industry finances.

Path Forward: Navigating the Uncertainty

Despite the setbacks, some industry players are moving forward with transition strategies:

Targeted Retrofitting: Research suggests that “long-term compliance and financial performance are best achieved through targeted retrofitting supported by carbon taxes and favourable market conditions”.

Fuel-Agnostic Approaches: Some operators are considering more flexible strategies that maintain options across multiple potential fuel pathways rather than committing to single solutions.

Regional Compliance: With the EU’s Emissions Trading System already covering shipping and FuelEU Maritime rules in force, operators trading in European waters must navigate existing regulations despite global uncertainty.

Conclusion: A Critical Juncture for Global Shipping

The IMO’s decision to delay its Net-Zero Framework represents more than a temporary setback—it signals a potentially dangerous stagnation in global shipping’s decarbonization efforts. As one climate minister stated after the vote: “This is unacceptable given the urgency we face in light of accelerating climate change”.

With shipping emissions projected to rise significantly without intervention, the industry stands at a crossroads. The coming year will be critical in determining whether global cooperation can prevail over national interests to provide the regulatory clarity needed to navigate toward a sustainable future.

As one industry representative summarized: “The industry has demonstrated its commitment to change, but the reality is that without regulatory clarity and global alignment, investment and innovation will remain hesitant”.

The proposed NZF aims to reduce global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the shipping industry by combining mandatory yearly emissions limits with penalties for failure to meet the set limits. NZF contains provisions requiring all oceangoing ships over 5,000 GT to reduce their annual GHG fuel intensity (GFI) from 2028. The GFI is calculated using a well-to-wake approach, measuring emissions from fuel production through to actual use onboard. If a ship emits below a certain threshold or fully switches to zero or near-zero emission fuels, it qualifies for financial rewards. If ships exceed the agreed emission levels, this will trigger CO2 levies.

The NZF is proposed to be included in a new Chapter 5 of Annex VI to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL). The regulations are expected to enter into force 16 months after the formal adoption, at which point governments will be responsible for enforcing them.

Had the framework been adopted in October 2025 as originally planned, entry into force would have been around March 2027, with the first reduction requirements applying from 2028. The postponement now creates uncertainty as to when the NZF will take effect and whether it will be subject to substantial amendments.

There are only two operational CCUS projects in the global iron and steel sector, which are delivering minimal capture rates.","Bill Hare is CEO and senior scientist with Climate Analytics.

The term “hard-to-abate” is widely claimed by heavy industry like the iron and steel sector to argue against having to reduce emissions quickly, or to justify their continued faith in carbon capture utilisation and storage (CCUS) – or offsets – to meet climate goals.

But continuing to classify highly polluting industrial sectors as “hard-to-abate” is jeopardising the world’s ability to achieve global net-zero CO2 emissions by around mid-century, critical to the Paris Agreement goal of limiting warming to 1.5C.

In a recent report, we have taken a forensic look at the iron and steel (and cement) sectors, showing how the “hard-to-abate” label has shaped both policy and industrial actions in ways that risk undermining the urgency and effectiveness of global climate mitigation efforts.

The iron and steel sector accounts for 7-8% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Technologies for achieving zero emissions in steel production are currently available at commercial scale, with strong policy support.

Yet this sector has convinced governments that it cannot mitigate its emissions without CCS – as evidenced by the recent German government announcement that sets aside €6 billion ($7 billion) to deal with hard-to-abate sectors like steel, which includes inviting proposals for CCS projects.

Iron and steel emissions are currently projected to be just 10% lower in 2050. Yet, in top-down scenarios that limit warming to 1.5C – such as the International Energy Agency’s Net Zero Emissions roadmap – combined CO2 emissions for iron and steel fall by about 23% by 2030 below 2023 levels, 46% by 2035 and 94% by 2050.

Existing tech and demand reduction can cut emissions

Steel is produced by one of three different methods. Nearly three-quarters of the world’s steel is still produced with the highly polluting “blast furnace to basic oxygen furnace” (BF-BOF). Here, coal is turned into coke at high temperatures to provide the carbon monoxide required to turn iron ore into iron. Coal typically also powers the furnace, where the steelmaking occurs. All stages of this process produce CO2.

The second is “direct reduced iron to electric arc furnace” (DRI-EAF) where iron ore is reduced in a direct reduction furnace in a solid state using a reduction gas such as hydrogen or syngas (often derived from fossil fuels). As the name implies, electric arc furnaces are powered by electricity, so there’s a choice of electricity generation sources.

Lastly, there’s scrap steel recycling in Electric Arc Furnaces (EAF), which can also be entirely powered by renewables.

This sector, we find, could feasibly reach near-zero residual CO2 emissions by around 2050 based on currently available technologies. If complemented by strong demand-side interventions without large-scale CCUS, this sector could potentially eliminate the need for negative CO2 emissions.

Carbon colonialism? Malaysia and Indonesia plan storage hubs for Asian emissions

Demand reduction measures, such as increased use of secondary steel and improving material efficiency, could reduce steel requirements by up to 20% by 2050, making deep decarbonisation even more achievable. Substantial emissions reductions could be achieved through circular economy strategies that reduce steel demand, such as cutting the ‘overspecification’ of steel in construction, which could lower steel use by 35–45%.

Advanced retrofitting of existing plants could also help limit warming to 1.5C. Substitution of green hydrogen and, only where necessary, CCUS, could lead to large reductions of up to 66% of cumulative emissions from this sector between 2020-2050, compared to estimated emissions levels without any interventions.

CCUS not working for industry

Industry recourse to future CCUS deployment and offsets must also be put in the context of doubts about the legitimate mitigation potential of these pathways. Because despite its frequent promotion, CCUS deployment in supposed hard-to-abate sectors – or indeed any sector – remains minimal for emissions abatement purposes.

Reliance on CCUS poses substantial technical, economic and scalability risks. It cannot capture 100% of emissions; residual emissions are inevitable.

The combined announced capacity for CCUS projects that are operating, planned or under construction in the steel sector is only 9 million tonnes of CO2 a year. This is just 0.3% of the total 2.6 billion tonnes of CO2 the steel sector emitted in 2022.

There are only two operational CCUS projects in the global iron and steel sector, which are delivering minimal capture rates. Aside from these, there are only 11 planned projects and one (two-stage) project under construction. This is compared to the more than 1,000 steel plants operating or under development globally.

Offsets, by design, allow CO2 emissions to occur that would not otherwise have occurred in their absence and often lack additionality, permanence and verifiability, thus failing to deliver real mitigation.

Together, CCUS and offsets allow companies to delay investment in transformative solutions. Strong policy and regulation should instead consider treating sectors like iron and steel as typical sectors with 1.5C-compatible emissions reduction obligations, reducing dependence on negative emissions by mid-century.",https://www.climatechangenews.com/wp-content/files/2025/10/GERMANY-Steel-works-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-22 17:16:34.872077

IMO Delays Key Climate Decision for Shipping

London 17th October 2025 – A scheduled Extraordinary Session of the IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee has ended without adopting the policy measures agreed upon in principle in April 2025. These measures are intended to reduce emissions from the shipping sector and kick-start the sector’s energy transition.

The meeting failed to complete the next milestone toward the entry into force of the “Net Zero Framework”. In the decision taken at the end of the week, a vote was called for by Saudi Arabia to adjourn the meeting for one year. The vote resulted in 57 countries accepting the motion, forming a majority of those present and voting, and the meeting was subsequently adjourned.

Dr Tristan Smith, Professor of Energy and Transport at UCL Energy Institute Shipping & Oceans Research Group said: “This is catastrophic for confidence, and therefore also for the equitable and ambitious decarbonisation we need. We will now have to double-down on other means to drive shipping GHG reduction and energy transition. Climate science tells us that the challenge of decarbonisation does not go away, it gets harder. This delay therefore means those with the means must step up and lead more than ever, until this multilateral process can regain its composure.”

A vote was also called at the MEPC 83 meeting in April 2025, agreeing in principle to the legal amendment to MARPOL Annex VI. A number of countries changed their positions relative to that vote, providing evidence that well-publicised threats from the United States, including tariffs and reprisals for any country that supported the Framework, and related pressure, were effective at changing positions. On this occasion, that pressure appears to have been effective.

US Pressure Delays IMO’s Net Zero Progress

Dr Annika Frosch, Research Fellow at UCL Energy Institute Shipping & Oceans Research Group said: “The adoption of the Net Zero Framework by the IMO would have marked a crucial step forward for shipping decarbonization. Although adoption has been postponed, the process remains underway, with key technical guidelines now the focus before potential adoption in 2026.”

The decision on the IMO’s Net Zero Framework does not override or change the foundation of the GHG Reduction Strategy that was adopted at MEPC 80 in 2023. This unanimously adopted strategy commits the organisation to absolute GHG emission reductions of 20-30% in 2030 and 70-80% in 2040, on a pathway to reaching net-zero emissions by/around 2050. As long as that is the stated strategy, the IMO should in theory make progress toward adopting regulations in line with it. However the outcome at IMO means further work on regional and national regulation of international shipping has now been vindicated, making current regulations such as those in EU likely to be prolonged. We could now see more regions taking similar action.

Dr Pinar Langer, Research Fellow at UCL Energy Institute Shipping & Oceans Research Group said: “This unexpected delay highlights both the complexity and the high stakes of reaching global alignment on shipping’s net-zero transition. The year ahead offers a vital window for constructive engagement and for strengthening the evidence base to ensure that when the framework is finally adopted, it is both equitable and actionable across diverse national contexts.”

Even with the outcome to defer the conclusion of the current adoption of the NZF, work on the underpinning guidelines can continue, with next week’s meeting (Intersessional Working Group 20th session) going ahead as planned. These guidelines will specify important details on definitions, calculations, and methods for determining how the policy incentivises and evaluates different technology and fuel options needed for decarbonisation, how the fund will be set up and run, and how its key parameters will be revised on an ongoing basis.

The IMO's Net-Zero Framework, designed to drive global shipping toward net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, has been delayed by one year. The decision came after intense negotiations failed to reach consensus, with the next opportunity for adoption set for late 2026. This postponement extends uncertainty for the maritime sector and may slow investment in green shipping technologies.

Market & Policy

Shipping accounts for nearly 3% of global CO₂ emissions and carries about 90% of world trade. The IMO’s proposed framework includes a global fuel standard and a greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions pricing mechanism. While broadly supported by industry and many governments, the framework faced opposition from key states, notably the United States and Saudi Arabia, who argued that a global carbon price could harm fuel producers and developing economies. The delay raises the risk of a patchwork of regional regulations, such as the EU’s inclusion of shipping in its Emissions Trading System, potentially undermining a level playing field. The IMO will continue technical negotiations, aiming to resolve concerns about fairness, revenue use, and implementation processes.

Technology & Innovation

The Net-Zero Framework is intended to accelerate adoption of alternative fuels, cleaner vessels, and carbon pricing in shipping. Technical work continues on guidelines for calculating fuel lifecycle emissions, structuring carbon credit trading, and supporting a just transition for developing countries. The delay may slow deployment of new technologies, as shipowners hesitate to invest amid regulatory uncertainty.

Funding & Projects

Industry leaders, including major shipowners and port authorities, have called for clear global rules to de-risk investments in green fuels and infrastructure. The delay may postpone large-scale funding decisions, but some regions, notably the EU, plan to proceed with their own measures. Stakeholders urge continued investment in pilot projects and R&D to maintain momentum.

Risks & Constraints

The main risks are regulatory fragmentation and delayed climate action. Without a global framework, shipping companies may face inconsistent requirements across regions, increasing compliance costs and complexity. Political divisions—especially over carbon pricing and support for developing nations—remain significant barriers. The earliest the framework could enter into force is now March 2028, assuming adoption in 2026.

Outlook

The coming year will be critical. The IMO’s working groups will seek to bridge gaps on financial impacts, revenue distribution, and procedural issues. Industry and regional regulators are encouraged to maintain progress and avoid a “wait-and-see” approach. If consensus is reached in 2026, the shipping sector could still achieve a unified, ambitious decarbonization pathway. For now, the sector faces a longer road to regulatory certainty and climate alignment.",https://thecurrentsource.net/og-image.jpg,N,,2025-10-22 18:00:20.512131

The United States has warned it may impose visa restrictions, port bans and sanctions on countries backing the UN's International Maritime Organization's IMO Net-Zero Framework to tax shipping emissions, reported Reuters.

UN member states are vote on IMO proposal, which aims to tax carbon dioxide emissions from shipping, which is responsible for more that two per cent of greenhouse gases.

us Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the administration 'unequivocally rejects??the proposal, calling it a threat to the global economy and a 'punitive and regressive??tax regime.

The US is considering retaliatory measures against supporting nations, including blocking flagged vessels from US ports, imposing visa fees and targeting officials behind climate-focused policies.

While major container carriers support a global framework to accelerate decarbonization, some of the world's largest oil tanker firms have voiced 'grave concerns??over the plan.

Supporters argue that without a unified global standard, the maritime industry risks facing a fragmented system of regional rules that would raise costs without effectively cutting emissions.

Members of the IMO initially voted in April to approve the net-zero framework and a carbon tax, agreeing to charge shipping companies for greenhouse gas emissions from their vessels if they exceed a certain threshold. However, the Trump administration’s effort now delays the vote by one full year.

“Last week’s IMO is a pivot point in this whole climate nonsense. We’re going to come back to the realistic views of energy, and President Trump is just all in on American energy dominance. That’s a win, not just for America. That’s a win for the world,” Wright added.

Delaying a vote on the IMO’s carbon tax marks another win for the Trump administration’s efforts to influence international climate policy. The Department of Energy on Wednesday stepped up its pressure on global climate action, sending a letter to the European Union regarding its corporate sustainability rules.

TRUMP SAYS US WON’T COMPLY WITH PROPOSED CARBON TAX ON SHIPPING INDUSTRY

The Energy Department, along with Qatar, sent a letter to the EU urging members to roll back the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD). The U.S. and Qatar argued that the rule would disrupt the trade in liquefied natural gas to Europe.

The rule requires firms operating in the EU to address human rights and environmental issues throughout their operations and supply chains. For non-compliant companies, the EU will impose a fine of up to 5%.

“[T]he CSDDD, as it is worded today, poses a significant risk to the affordability and reliability of critical energy supplies for households and businesses across Europe and an existential threat to the future growth, competitiveness, and resilience of the EU’s industrial economy,” the letter reads.","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP25287656740595.jpg?resize=1024,683",N,,2025-10-22 15:16:28.325772

In the immortal worlds of Billy Ocean, and someone at the AEA conference this week, when the going gets tough…","Quantum Commodity Intelligence - Friday's IMO announcement that CO2 emissions in the shipping industry are not likely to be taxed in 2027, proved to be only a mild damper on the mood at the Ammonia Energy Association annual meeting being held in Houston this week.

As the conference opened on Monday, the elephant in the room — the International Maritime Organization's (IMO) decision on Friday not to vote on the introduction of the Net-Zero Framework — was swiftly acknowledged by participants.

Once that was out the way, participants at the conference refocused on company collaboration and regional policies to maintain clean ammonia momentum, even if international carbon policy for the marine sector remains unclear.

Importance of partnerships

Global government policy has proven to be predictably unreliable for the clean energy space. This is leading companies to rely on collaborations within the private sector to develop further the technology, feasibility, funding, and certification for the low-carbon ammonia sector.

By the end of day two of the conference, it was clear just how much progress has been made in the clean ammonia space, regarding ammonia's potential role as a fuel in shipping and power generation, and as a carrier for the hydrogen economy. Despite delays to CO2 tariff implementation, and setbacks in power sector auctions, the industry is powering through.

Partnering in projects has proved the lifeline for the clean ammonia industry. And collaborations were highlighted during the conference, as panels discussed the CF Industries, JERA, and Mitsui's Blue Point project in Louisiana, cooperation between technology firms on marine engines, and companies teaming up on improving ammonia cracker performance.

With the conference based in Houston this year, there was also considerable interest from both small and major industry participants, vying for partnerships for blue ammonia projects in the US to secure 45Q carbon credit incentives.

Industry resilience

Scaling up clean ammonia demand and technology remained at the forefront of the conference agenda. Despite near-term setbacks, the sector is proving to be resilient, and is continually finding ways to keep momentum going. The AEA event highlighted technology advancements this week, particularly with regards to nitrous oxide emissions.

A few years ago, little work had been done on addressing NOx and N2O concerns linked to burning ammonia as a fuel, but these had to be quickly addressed as ammonia combustion tests began a few years ago, and the emissions became evident.

At the time, some said NOx emissions from ammonia fuel could signal the end to efforts to make it a viable fuel alternative. But within two years, the industry has responded, and companies this week showcased technologies that have been developed to reduce emissions from ammonia engines, making it a safe and viable fuel alternative once again.

Create the demand

Possibly as a response to lack of clear regulatory direction from the maritime sector, there was also considerable focus on ammonia's potential as a hydrogen carrier during the AEA conference this week.

One of the major issues facing the clean ammonia sector over the last year has been the lack of firm offtake demand for the product due to cost sensitivities. Developers looking to supply hydrogen using ammonia as a carrier, are looking to develop the demand side of this sector. Having seen the pitfalls of bringing supply onstream before there is a ready market, some developers are choosing to focus on the creating demand first and worrying about supply later.

The outcome represents a significant setback for what would have been the world's first internationally mandated emissions reduction targets for the shipping industry.
The Bahamas and Antigua & Barbuda, both of which agreed to the deal's terms in April, were two countries that abstained.
""We came to London in reluctant support of the IMO's Net Zero Framework,"" he explained.
Industry seeks regulatory certainty The shipping industry had broadly supported the framework as it would provide consistent global standards for investment planning.","A landmark agreement to decarbonise global shipping has been postponed for at least a year after the International Maritime Organisation voted to delay adoption of its Net Zero Framework.

The motion to adjourn passed by a narrow margin on 17 October, with delegates from more than a hundred countries voting at the Marine Environment Protection Committee's extraordinary session in London.

In total, 57 delegates voted in favour of adjournment and 49 voted against it, while 21 abstained entirely.

The outcome represents a significant setback for what would have been the world's first internationally mandated emissions reduction targets for the shipping industry.

The deal, which was initially agreed in principle in April after a decade of negotiations, included several measures to encourage sustainable shipping, including introducing fines for any companies that did not at least start to use low-carbon fuels by 2028.

How the US used trade to influence voters

The delay followed intensive lobbying from the US administration, which had threatened countries with tariffs if they supported the framework.

US President Donald Trump called the plan a ""green scam"" in a post on Truth Social, declaring the US would not tolerate ""increased prices on American Consumers"". Back in the US, Secretary of State Marco Rubio went on to describe the postponement as a ""huge win"" for Trump's government.

Delegations from developing countries reported what they described as ""bullying"" and ""unprecedented"" pressure from Washington, with threats of sanctions alongside tariff warnings.

Even some island nations – which are at particular threat from rising sea levels – abstained from voting, leading to the lengthy adjournment.

The Bahamas and Antigua & Barbuda, both of which agreed to the deal's terms in April, were two countries that abstained.

A delegate from the island states group subsequently told the BBC that these nations particularly rely on the US for trade and had been leaned on heavily by the Trump administration to change their position.

Saudi Arabia's role in the collapsed talks

Saudi Arabia brought the motion to adjourn to a vote on the final day of talks, when countries were scheduled to approve the framework.

The chairman of the negotiations confirmed that this meant the agreement was not approved, as key timelines for the treaty would require revision.

Ralph Regenvanu, Minister for Climate Change for the Republic of Vanuatu, said that Saudi Arabia's motion was ""unacceptable given the urgency we face in light of accelerating climate change"".

Mr. Regenvanu, who has been a vocal advocate for climate justice in recent years, saw the bill as imperfect but far better than a future without a framework.

""We came to London in reluctant support of the IMO's Net Zero Framework,"" he explained. ""While it lacks the ambition that climate science demands, it does mark a significant step.""

China, which had initially supported the deal in April, also agreed to the delay.

What the framework would have achieved

The Net Zero Framework would have required ship owners to use increasingly cleaner fuels from 2028 or face financial penalties. The mechanism would apply to vessels over 5,000 gross tonnes, establishing a market-based system of credits and penalties.

Ships exceeding emission limits would need to purchase remedial units, whilst low-emission vessels could earn and trade surplus credits.

Revenue would flow into an IMO Net-Zero Fund intended to support clean fuel adoption and assist developing countries with the transition.

Shipping currently accounts for 3% of global emissions, with 90% of all goods transported by sea. Without intervention, the IMO previously estimated emissions could grow between 10% and 150% by 2050.

Industry seeks regulatory certainty

The shipping industry had broadly supported the framework as it would provide consistent global standards for investment planning.

Thomas Kazakos, Secretary-General of the International Chamber of Shipping, said: ""We are disappointed that member states have not been able to agree a way forward at this meeting.""

Thomas added: ""Industry needs clarity to be able to make the investments.""

IMO Secretary General Arsenio Dominguez issued a closing plea following the vote, stating: ""As we come to an end my plea to you is not to repeat the way we have approached this meeting in other discussions for future discussions.""

Arsenio urged delegates to use the year to ""negotiate and talk and come to consensus"" before reconvening in 2026.

The UK and most EU nations voted to continue the talks, though Greece abstained contrary to the broader EU position.

Blánaid Sheeran, policy officer at environmental NGO Opportunity Green, warned: ""A delay in action may require changes to the text of agreement that undermine the planned timeline, and could revert years of work to date.""",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/5dac8d3461678e86d99bbee38615c779:6d76bad764c9f92b6bbcd83a32ffed85/graphics-for-work-65.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-10-22 11:20:41.107313

Major energy and commodity traders, whose shipping operations often carry large carbon footprints, are now investing in cleaner and more efficient shipping. With the International Maritime Organization (IMO) calling for a 40% reduction in shipping’s carbon intensity by 2030 from 2008 levels, these players are now deploying new methods to cut emissions at sea. Retrofitting old vessels or even order state-of-the-art tankers with clean fuel capacity, energy traders are emerging as unexpected champions of green shipping.

Take BGN International, for example. The Geneva-base private commodity trader recently begun modernizing its fleet by adding advanced gas carriers with an eye on emissions reduction. In 2023, the company took delivery of two Very Large Gas Carriers (VLGCs) equipped with modern hull designs to minimize drag along with dual-fuel engines that can run on lower-carbon fuels. This year the firm, in partnership with UAE-based Al Seer Marine, welcomed a third new VLGC named Merak, which can carry ammonia cargo and operate on both traditional and alternative fuels. “This state-of-the-art vessel... underlines our commitment to contributing to industry-wide decarbonization efforts,” BGN CEO Rüya Bayegan said upon Merak’s delivery. The company now boasts one of the largest VLGC fleets in its sector. As a result, it now also has a range of carrier sizes that can operate in both underserved markets with undeveloped infrastructure, and modern markets with advanced ports. These appear to be a strong steps to align with IMO’s decarbonization goals.

Energy traders are also squeezing better performance out of existing vessels. Take Vitol, one of the world’s largest traders that operates a substantial shipping fleet. The Dutch-based company has been conducting an extensive retrofit program since 2022 to curb emissions from its vessels. Hulls are being cleared of biofouling and coated with high-end anti-fouling paint, and ships are being fitted with energy-saving devices like pre-swirl stators and propeller caps with fins to improve propulsion efficiency. These measures yield fuel savings of roughly 6% - a significant gain in an industry where incremental efficiency translates to big emissions and cost cuts. Vitol says its fleet is on track to meet the IMO’s 2030 emission-reduction target years ahead of schedule.

Traders are making bold bets on next-generation shipping technology. Trafigura, like BGN and others, is looking to ammonia as a zero carbon option to power ships in the future. In May 2025, Trafigura placed an order at Hyundai Mipo shipyard for four medium-sized gas carriers designed with dual-fuel engines that can run on ammonia. Each 190-meter vessel will be able to carry 45,000 cubic meters of liquefied gas and use ammonia as bunker fuel, with special systems to ensure safe handling of the corrosive, toxic fuel. This first-of-its-kind fleet won’t hit the water until 2028, but the company sees it as a critical step toward maritime decarbonization. “[This project] supports our commitments to decarbonising shipping and will help develop the global low-carbon ammonia bunkering infrastructure needed for zero-carbon shipping to become a reality,” says Andrea Olivi, Trafigura’s Head of Wet Freight. The initiative is part of a broader industry partnership that involves a host of maritime experts, engine makers, and port authorities to test and prove ammonia’s viability as a marine fuel.

The push by energy companies to reduce maritime emissions complements efforts by shipowners, shipbuilders, and regulators to do the same. Industry veterans observe that no single player can decarbonize shipping alone - it requires coordination across fuel suppliers, vessel operators, technologists, and financiers. Cross-industry collaboration will be key to shaping the future, as BGN’s shipping unit noted after a recent decarbonization forum. Indeed, many of these green vessel initiatives involve partnerships to properly reduce scope 1 and 2 emissions: BGN’s joint venture with Al Seer Marine, Gunvor’s with Solvang, and Trafigura’s multi-party ammonia fuel project all underscore the power of collaboration. Banks appear particularly excited about the growing trend. Middle Eastern lenders recently financed newbuild gas carriers, citing contribution to “sustainable development and innovation in the maritime sector” and its alignment with “decarbonization efforts in the marine industry”.

As global shipping navigates toward stricter carbon targets, the engagement of energy traders is a welcome tailwind. These companies are leveraging their deep financial networks and market knowledge to today’s fleet efficiency to piloting tomorrow’s fuel technologies. The result is a maritime ecosystem that is gradually but steadily trimming its carbon sails. By investing in greener ships and practices, energy firms are burnishing their sustainability credentials whilst also helping to propel the entire industry into an era of lower emissions and smarter shipping. The course is set for a lower carbon horizon.

The delay, decided during last week’s Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) meeting in London, risks creating a standstill in global climate ambition and lowering the pace of progress in maritime decarbonisation.

The NZF was expected to establish a global regulatory foundation for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from shipping, including a fuel standard and a pricing mechanism. ESPO considers this postponement a missed opportunity to accelerate the sector’s transition to clean fuels and fears it will further prolong the fragmentation and unlevel playing field stemming from regional regulations.

This decision is particularly disappointing given the strong calls from across the shipping sector for a unified global approach. The momentum was there, with broad support for a framework that could provide clarity, predictability, and a level playing field for all actors in the maritime supply chain. The postponement risks undermining this rare moment of convergence and weakens the credibility of international climate leadership in shipping.

Despite this setback, ESPO welcomes the European Commission’s new strategy to shape a global clean and resilient transition, which aims to inject political momentum into climate action, support clean tech industries, and expand global partnerships for sustainable value chains.

To maintain progress and incentivise the uptake of clean fuels, ESPO calls on the Commission to take concrete actions, including:

Introducing targeted tax exemptions for electricity used by ships at berth and for zero-carbon fuels such as green methanol, ammonia, and hydrogen, to reduce operating costs and stimulate demand.

Deploying subsidies and carbon contracts for difference (CCfDs) to bridge the price gap between fossil and sustainable fuels, especially in early deployment phases.

Using revenues from the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) to support port infrastructure for clean fuel bunkering and onshore power supply (OPS), prioritising those investments where it makes most sense.

Incentivising the demand for clean fuels, taking away the uncertainty and making it more attractive for fuel producers and suppliers to invest and step up capacity.

The postponement should not be interpreted as a cancellation. ESPO acknowledges that the IMO’s technical work on developing guidelines and implementation pathways is still ongoing. ESPO urges all stakeholders—governments, industry, and civil society—not to lose faith in the process and to continue contributing constructively. The global maritime community must stay engaged and committed to shaping a framework that is both ambitious and workable.

Moreover, in the provisional absence of a breakthrough at global level, Europe’s ports ask the Commission to effectively address the negative impacts of the EU regional approach measures on business leakage and competitiveness. Awaiting a possible alignment between EU and future IMO regulations, market distortions that undermine the strength of European ports should be recognised and addressed.

ESPO finally also calls on the Commission, EU Member States, and the maritime stakeholders to continue pushing for robust global regulation under the IMO, ensuring that international shipping remains on a credible path toward net-zero emissions.",https://m.psecn.photoshelter.com/img-get/I00007RWZV3kKofk/s/848/I00007RWZV3kKofk.jpg,N,,2025-10-22 11:20:53.471862

The US had already rejected the draft terms on reducing the industry’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in August, describing the framework as a “global carbon tax on Americans levied by an unaccountable UN organisation”.

During crucial talks to approve the deal held last week (October 17), Singapore and Saudi Arabia led on a proposal to adjourn the talks for a year, which garnered votes from the US and Russia.

A total of 57 countries voted in favour of the delay, while 49 voted against, and 21 abstained.

The delay “reduces the likelihood of passing the previously agreed proposal”, warned Rico Luman, senior economist, transport and logistics at Dutch bank ING.

In its current guise, the framework would bring in a set of “mid-term measures” that include targets for reducing ships’ annual GHG fuel intensity and penalties for ships that emit more than this.

“While the delay provides additional time to build consensus – also within different shipping segments – momentum appears to be fading, making agreement increasingly difficult,” Luman said.

“Continued procrastination could ultimately lead to cancellation, which would be a disappointing outcome.”

If the framework had been approved this month, the measures would have come into force in 2027, but the delay means implementation will now be pushed back to 2028 at the earliest.

Jennifer Cornejo, partner at law firm Vinson & Elkins, added: “Because the net zero framework had certain milestones, the pause almost certainly forces revisions to those compliance timelines and could reopen debates on certain aspects, such that the package next voted on is narrower in some ways.”

The delay could also result in a “patchwork of regional regimes” that might lead to increased compliance costs and an uncertain regulatory or investment environment, she said.

Ahead of the meeting last week, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, and Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy said in a joint statement that the Trump administration “unequivocally rejects this proposal”.

“The economic impacts from this measure could be disastrous, with some estimates forecasting global shipping costs increasing as much as 10% or more,” the statement said.

It laid out several steps the US could take against countries that support the net-zero framework, including blocking vessels from US ports and imposing new regulation and extra visa restrictions, as well as commercial penalties via government contracts.

Emma Fenton, senior director of climate diplomacy at climate change NGO Opportunity Green, called the outcome a “devastating indictment of member states’ lack of courage to stand in solidarity with climate vulnerable countries to achieve a just and equitable maritime transition”.

“Faced with pressure, too many governments chose political compromise over climate justice, and in doing so, abandoned the countries bearing the brunt of the climate crisis.”

Yet, some say the delay could offer an opportunity to review weaknesses in the mechanisms proposed in the net-zero framework.

Norwegian energy consultancy Rystad Energy found “critical gaps” in the current framework between the projected availability of green fuel and the targeted demand, “which raises concerns about the feasibility of the prescribed transition timeline”.

“Our findings suggest progress will likely lag behind the IMO’s current expectations due to infrastructure limits, technology readiness and energy system interconnections,” said Junlin Yu, vice president of supply chain research at Rystad Energy.

“The IMO should use the extra year to refine the net zero framework into a more practical and equitable framework.”

If ships exceed their targets for GHG emissions, they can transfer surplus units from other vessels, use units they have previously banked if they have outperformed the targets, or pay penalties in the form of buying “remedial” units.

Rystad Energy’s projections also suggest that demand for remedial units will outstrip surplus unit supply until 2035.

If the price of surplus units is governed by market dynamics rather than cost premiums for greener fuel, this could limit the incentives for zero-emission technologies, according to Rystad Energy.

ING’s Luman also pointed out that the shipping sector’s projected CO₂ reductions by 2030 fall short of earlier ambitions, meaning that the IMO’s 2040 and 2050 targets are becoming “increasingly challenging”.

In 2023, the IMO agreed to target a 20% reduction in total annual emissions by 2030 compared to 2008 levels and a 70% reduction in total emissions by 2040.

Net zero is set to be achieved “by or around” 2050, to allow for “different national circumstances”.",https://www.gtreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Cargo-ship-smoke-exhaust_News.jpg,N,,2025-10-22 08:20:27.044293

The Trump administration had expressed strong opposition to the pact and threatened retaliatory action if it was approved.

IMO members met this month to vote on whether to formally adopt the “Net-Zero Framework” of fuel standards for ships. Under this framework ships would have to reduce their annual GHG fuel intensity over time, with ships emitting above certain thresholds required to acquire remedial units to balance their deficit emissions and those using zero or near-zero GHG technologies eligible for financial rewards. These measures, which had been expected to enter into force in 2027, would be mandatory for oceangoing ships over 5,000 gross tonnage, which the IMO said emit 85 percent of the total CO2 emissions from international shipping.

However, earlier this year the Trump administration claimed that this framework “is effectively a global carbon tax on Americans levied by an unaccountable UN organization” that “would conveniently benefit China by requiring the use of expensive fuels unavailable at global scale.” It would also “preclude the use of proven technologies that fuel global shipping fleets, including lower emissions options where U.S. industry leads such as liquified natural gas (LNG) and biofuels” and instead would require ships to “pay fees for failing to meet unattainable fuel standards and emissions targets.”

At that time the White House warned other IMO members that the U.S. “will look for their support against this action and not hesitate to retaliate or explore remedies for our citizens should this endeavor fail.” Such retaliation could include tariffs, visa restrictions, and/or port levies.

While the IMO did convene a meeting this month to consider adopting the agreement, on Oct. 17 a majority of members at that meeting voted to adjourn it and reconvene in 12 months.

Global shipping must stay on a credible path toward net-zero emissions.”","The European Sea Ports Organisation (ESPO) has expressed deep concern over the International Maritime Organisation’s (IMO) decision to delay the adoption of the Net-Zero Framework (NZF) by one year. The decision, made during last week’s Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) meeting in London, risks slowing global climate action in shipping.

The NZF was set to provide a global roadmap to cut greenhouse gas emissions from shipping through a fuel standard and pricing mechanism. ESPO calls the delay a missed opportunity to speed up the transition to clean fuels. The organisation warns that continued fragmentation between regional and global rules will harm competitiveness and create uncertainty.

The postponement is especially disappointing given the broad industry support for a unified global approach. “Momentum was building,” ESPO said. “The sector needs clarity and predictability, not another year of waiting.” The delay weakens confidence in the IMO’s climate leadership and risks losing the rare alignment among governments, shipowners, and ports.

Despite the setback, ESPO welcomes the European Commission’s new strategy for a clean and resilient transition. The plan aims to boost clean-tech industries, expand global partnerships, and keep climate action on track.

To maintain progress, ESPO urges the Commission to take practical steps now:

Grant tax exemptions for onshore electricity and zero-carbon fuels like green methanol, ammonia, and hydrogen.

Support clean fuel adoption through subsidies and carbon contracts for difference (CCfDs).

Use EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) revenues to fund port infrastructure for clean fuel bunkering and onshore power supply (OPS).

Incentivise fuel demand to encourage investment in production and supply capacity.

ESPO stresses that postponement must not mean loss of ambition. The IMO’s technical work continues, and all stakeholders, governments, industry, and civil society, should stay engaged. “We must keep pushing for a strong, workable global framework,” ESPO urged.

In the meantime, ESPO asks the European Commission to address negative impacts of the EU’s regional measures on competitiveness. Until global alignment is achieved, Europe must act to prevent market distortions and protect the strength of its ports.

ESPO concludes: “Europe must keep leading. The IMO delay should strengthen our resolve, not weaken it. Global shipping must stay on a credible path toward net-zero emissions.”",https://container-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/william-william-NndKt2kF1L4-unsplash-1-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-10-22 08:20:51.403186

Argent Energy, a UK producer of waste-based biodiesel with operations in the UK and Netherlands, said progress must continue.

“The industry must not stand still” said Dickon Posnett, corporate affairs director at Argent Energy.

“The IMO’s efforts remain vital, but regulatory delays should not deter shipping companies from acting now. Solutions exist now. Companies can act now.”

Argent Energy advocates for the wider adoption of waste-derived biodiesel. A drop-in fuel that can be used in existing vessels without modification. These fuels offer an immediate reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.

Argent SeaFuel is already in use across multiple European maritime routes. The biofuel used is produced exclusively from waste-based feedstocks and meets stringent sustainability standards. It aligns with both the IMO’s Net-Zero Framework and the FuelEU Maritime Regulation.

“The climate crisis isn’t waiting, and neither should we” said Dickon. “No single country or interest group should hold back global progress.”

Argent Energy says momentum must continue. It supports those working to improve the IMO framework over the next year. But it urges the industry to act in parallel.

More than 100 countries had gathered in London on 17 October to approve the IMO Net-Zero Framework, which had been agreed in April after 10 years of negotiations. Had it passed, it would have seen shipping become the first industry to adopt internationally mandated targets to reduce emissions.

But the decision has been delayed after a motion tabled by Saudi Arabia to adjourn talks for a year passed narrowly.

Shipping currently makes up 3% of global emissions. The regulation – spearheaded by UN agency the International Maritime Organization – would require ships to gradually reduce the amount of greenhouse gas emitted for each unit of energy used across their fuel’s lifecycle.

To encourage the industry to comply with this global fuel standard, the regulation includes a pricing mechanism, with set prices for the greenhouse gases ships emit.

In the run up to the meeting, representatives of the Trump administration had threatened countries with tariffs and other economic penalties had they voted for the deal, which it said would lead to price rises for consumers.

The US and Russia voted in favour of Saudi Arabia’s motion to delay the talks, as did several countries that had initially agreed to the deal in April, including China and the Bahamas. Greece, Cyprus, and Antigua and Barbuda, which had also previously agreed to the treaty, were among those that chose to abstain from the vote.

Those in favour of the framework say the delay will allow its opponents to drum up support to kill it.

Celebration and disappointment

US secretary of state Marco Rubio declared the outcome a “huge win” for president Donald Trump, who had called the framework a “green scam” and said he was “outraged” by the effort to bring in the regulation.

European Commission executive vice president Teresa Ribera called the delay “a huge shame”, while Ralph Regenvanu, minister for climate change for Vanuatu – an island nation in the South Pacific which is particularly vulnerable to climate change – said Saudi Arabia’s motion was “unacceptable given the urgency we face in light of accelerating climate change”.

“We came to London in reluctant support of the IMO’s Net-Zero Framework. While it lacks the ambition that climate science demands, it does mark a significant step,” he said.

He said there had been “relentless pressure” from the US for countries to back its position.

Observers say the delay to the carefully mapped out timeline to get the regulation in place means it will not be feasible to implement it by 2028, as had been planned.",https://www.globalgovernmentforum.com/wp-content/uploads/2025-10-22_IMO-Net-Zero-Framework_cargo-ship_CREDIT-Tom-Fisk-via-Pexels-620x414.jpg,N,,2025-10-22 08:21:04.325102

MEPC ES.2 Opening Remark - Mr. Arsenio Dominguez on 14 October 2025.

The Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC)—a body within the International Maritime Organization (IMO) responsible for addressing environmental issues including regulating and preventing ship-source pollution under the MARPOL treaty—convened an extraordinary session from October 14-17. The session was held to debate draft amendments to MARPOL Annex VI, including the IMO Net-Zero Framework, which was previously approved in principle at MEPC 83 earlier this year.

After several days of intense negotiations without a consensus, the Committee decided late on Friday to adjourn the final adoption of the framework for one year. A total of 57 countries were in favor of the delay; 49 countries were against it, and there were 21 abstentions.

MEPC 83 – Setting ambition

At MEPC 83 in April, Member States endorsed the IMO Net-Zero Framework. This was a landmark step toward achieving the Organization’s goal of net-zero GHG emissions from international shipping by 2050. Sixty-three countries voted yes, versus sixteen that were in opposition. The Framework introduces, for the first time, mandatory global greenhouse-gas (GHG) limits alongside an emission-pricing mechanism. This decision marked a fundamental shift in how the sector will manage its carbon footprint.

While the initiative received broad support as a necessary step for global alignment, several critical design elements remain unresolved, including:

Default emission factors and lifecycle accounting for fuels;

Certification schemes for sustainable and zero-emission fuels;

Infrastructure for a central compliance registry;

Pricing and governance for post-2030 “remedial units”.

Despite criticism of under-ambitious targets, compared to the Organization’s long-term net-zero objective by 2050, the IMO NZF is a vital first step towards monetizing maritime emissions. The gap reflects a familiar challenge of multilateralism — consensus often yields the lowest common denominator.

MEPC ES.2 - Negotiation and delay

The second extraordinary session addressed several key agenda items, including:

Review of the IMO Data Collection System (DCS) and access to emissions data.

Short-term evaluation of existing GHG reduction measures.

Establishment of a North Atlantic Emission Control Area (NOx, SOx, PM).

Consideration of the Net-Zero Framework (NZF).

The NZF dominated the session. It is the first attempt to introduce a global emissions-pricing model for shipping — a measure intended to send a clear market signal and unlock investment in low-emission fuels, new builds, and retrofits. Without such clarity, the industry’s decarbonization financing remains uncertain.

Following the decision to adjourn adoption by one year, the framework is targeted to come into force in 2028, consistent with the first reporting period. The vote does not alter the formal timeline, but it underscores the difficulty of turning consensus into implementation. As the meeting reminded delegates, global rulemaking is never straightforward: agreement does not mean readiness.

Still, the Intersessional Working Group on the Reduction of Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Ships (ISWG-GHG), scheduled from Oct. 20-24, will proceed to continue working on the implementation guidelines for the Net Zero Framework.

Multilateral Dynamics

Three broad camps emerged during the debate:

Proactive coalition – Advocating decisive collective action and stronger measures, including the EU (except Greece, Malta, and Cyprus), Brazil, and Pacific Island nations;

Cautious supporters – Endorsing the framework’s objectives but calling for more time to clarify details and ensure equitable outcomes;

Opponents – Rejecting the principle of a global pricing mechanism altogether, led by the United States and Saudi Arabia.

This alignment highlights both the strength and fragility of multilateralism: while nearly all maritime nations share the same table, diverging interests often paralyze progress. It also exposes diverging interests that can paralyze progress. The challenge ahead is to avoid further polarization within the IMO, where the ambition to reinforce global governance could instead deepen divides.

The Regional Complexity

As global negotiations stall, regional initiatives may gain further momentum. The European Union’s ETS and FuelEU Maritime frameworks have already set the pace for carbon pricing and fuel standards. Continued delays could prompt other regions to explore independent carbon mechanisms.

If the IMO fails to deliver a credible mechanism, the risk of regulatory fragmentation — with overlapping and inconsistent carbon regimes — will increase, undermining the global level playing field the NZF was meant to secure.

The Way forward

The delay represents a setback for those seeking investment certainty and a unified decarbonization pathway. Yet, it can be viewed from two angles:

The optimist’s view: an extra year provides an opportunity to strengthen the framework, refine its mechanisms, and build broader support around a fair and effective solution.

The realist’s view: the industry may simply not be ready, and achieving consensus next year could prove even more difficult.

Many fuel producers, shipbuilders, and cargo owners have said they need reassurance that shipping is, in fact, charting a cleaner course before they invest billions of dollars in making new fuels and building related infrastructure.
“There is a lack of incentive globally for shipping operators to use clean fuels,” said Jade Patterson, an analyst for the research firm BloombergNEF.
In the meantime, the industry will continue guzzling greater volumes of fossil fuels as shipping activity grows over time.
How clean those fuels actually are depends largely on whether the hydrogen is produced using renewables, or the way that most H2 is made today: with fossil fuels.","This summer, an ammonia-powered ship completed its maiden voyage in eastern China, becoming the first of its kind to run purely on the carbonless compound. Around the same time, in Denmark, the shipping giant Maersk launched a big container ship that can use methanol, making it the fourteenth and largest vessel yet in the company’s growing low-carbon fleet.

Efforts like these are playing out worldwide as the maritime industry works to replace dirty diesel fuel in oceangoing ships, which haul everything from T-shirts and tropical fruit to solar panels, smartphones, and steel rebar. But the progress to date has been piecemeal, representing only a sliver of the world’s oil-guzzling freighters and tankers.

Up until last week, the United Nations’ International Maritime Organization appeared on the cusp of approving a strategy to supercharge shipping decarbonization worldwide. The plan was set in motion in 2015, after the U.N. adopted the Paris Agreement, clarifying the urgent need for countries and companies to reduce planet-warming pollution to zero.

“It sent a signal for the [maritime] industry to start thinking ahead,” said Narayan Subramanian, an expert on international climate policy and clean energy finance at Columbia Climate School.

In the ensuing decade, the IMO worked to hash out regulations that could jumpstart a universal transition toward cleaner ships. The agency landed on the Net-Zero Framework, which would require ships to use more low-carbon fuels and also establish a tax on carbon emissions — setting the first binding carbon-pricing scheme for an entire industry.

“This is not coming out of left field. It’s not being imposed overnight,” Subramanian said last week before IMO officials put the framework to a vote.

Yet on Oct. 17, after a full-throttle offensive from the Trump administration, the IMO moved to delay making any decision on the landmark decarbonization strategy by one year, keeping the industry locked in limbo. Many fuel producers, shipbuilders, and cargo owners have said they need reassurance that shipping is, in fact, charting a cleaner course before they invest billions of dollars in making new fuels and building related infrastructure.

“There is a lack of incentive globally for shipping operators to use clean fuels,” said Jade Patterson, an analyst for the research firm BloombergNEF. He said the framework would improve the business case for using hydrogen-based fuels like ammonia and methanol, which are significantly more expensive than oil- and gas-based fuels.

A smaller group of IMO members is meeting in London this week to drill down on the finer details of the proposed regulations, which will come up for a vote again in October 2026. But it’s unclear whether any global environmental agreement can succeed while President Donald Trump is in office.

In the meantime, the industry will continue guzzling greater volumes of fossil fuels as shipping activity grows over time.

Slashing CO2 from dirty ships

Tens of thousands of merchant ships ply the oceans every year to haul roughly 11 billion metric tons of goods. Together, they’re responsible for about 3% of the world’s annual greenhouse gas emissions.

The Net-Zero Framework was meant to give teeth to the nonbinding climate goals that IMO adopted in 2023. Member countries set near-term targets for reducing cargo-ship emissions by at least 20% by 2030, compared to 2008 levels. They also called for curbing emissions by at least 70% by 2040, and for reaching net-zero emissions ​“by or around” 2050.

Countries further agreed to have 5% to 10% of shipping’s energy use come from zero- or near-zero-emissions fuels and technologies by 2030.

Current adoption of those fuels amounts to a tiny droplet in an ocean’s worth of oil. Much of it is driven by voluntary efforts by companies like Maersk, which face pressure from investors and customers to clean up their fleets. Meanwhile, regional environmental policies are taking effect. European nations and China are working to rein in ship-engine pollution, and they and other countries — including Brazil, India, and, until recently, the United States — are steering government funding into hydrogen production.

Hydrogen is a key component of ammonia and methanol — two common chemicals that can be used in engines or fuel cells. How clean those fuels actually are depends largely on whether the hydrogen is produced using renewables, or the way that most H2 is made today: with fossil fuels. Renewable diesel, another lower-carbon option for powering vessels, also uses hydrogen in its production process.

If every project to produce green ammonia, green methanol, and renewable diesel comes online as planned, and if the fuels only go toward powering ships — not airplanes or vehicles or to other uses — they would make up less than 20% of global shipping’s fuel needs in 2030, which are expected to reach 290 million metric tons that year, Patterson said.

Those are two enormous ​“ifs.” Many of the announced fuel projects are facing serious headwinds, including high inflation, soaring production costs, and the Trump administration’s steep tariffs and clean-energy funding cuts. IMO’s recent decision to punt on its net-zero vote only deepens those challenges.

Last year, Danish energy giant Ørsted canceled plans to build a green-methanol plant in Sweden, citing weaker-than-expected interest from the maritime sector. Another Ørsted methanol project in Texas is facing uncertainty after the U.S. Department of Energy in May revoked an award of up to $99 million for the facility, as part of sweeping cuts to the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations. In the Netherlands last month, Shell said it is abandoning construction on a biofuels plant in Rotterdam owing to the fuel’s lack of competitiveness.

“What we’ve seen is that this lack of demand and the shift in policy has led many projects to fold,” said Ingrid Irigoyen, president and CEO of the Zero Emission Maritime Buyers Alliance. ​“But that’s not because they weren’t good projects. These are good fuels that we need, and which are vastly scalable.”

The buyers alliance is a nonprofit group of about 50 multinational companies that helps negotiate clean-fuel contracts — including for waste-based biomethane — between producers, vessel operators, and firms that put their goods on ships. Irigoyen said such voluntary initiatives are meant to be a ​“catalyst” that helps to scale production and bring down costs of alternative fuels, not the sole engine of shipping decarbonization.

“We can’t do it alone,” she added.

Even as shipping-industry groups and climate experts push for a global policy, there’s still widespread disagreement about how the framework should work in practice. Environmental groups oppose including crop-based biofuels, like soy and palm oil, given that their production can lead to forest loss and increase overall emissions. Policy analysts note that the ripple effects of higher fuel costs and carbon taxes across supply chains could disproportionately affect small and developing economies.

As IMO members navigate those questions, shipbuilders and owners are holding their breath for the answers.

This year, the number of new orders for alternative-fueled vessels has markedly declined compared to last year as companies adopt a ​“wait and see” approach, according to Jason Stefanatos, global decarbonization director at DNV.

In September, the advisory firm recorded no fresh orders for ships capable of running on methanol or ammonia, though nearly 360 methanol ships and nearly 40 ammonia ships are on the books through 2030.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/GettyImages-2110570779.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=f8ad6e1c8d83e60897ae6e9ff7324983,N,,2025-10-22 04:16:28.689840

The decision, made in London after tense negotiations among 176 member states, halts what was shaping up to be one of the most transformative policy shifts in maritime regulation. For Africa, whose trade arteries pulse through maritime routes, this delay reverberates far beyond the docks, touching the continent’s economic, environmental, and developmental ambitions.

The framework, initially endorsed by a majority of nations in April 2025, was designed to cap and progressively reduce greenhouse gas emissions from ships, which currently account for about 3% of global emissions, roughly equal to Germany’s annual output. Left unchecked, maritime emissions are projected to double by 2050, eroding global climate gains and placing vulnerable coastal regions, many in Africa, at heightened risk from rising sea levels and erratic weather patterns. The IMO plan proposed a global fuel standard, a carbon pricing system, and a Net-Zero Fund to reward low-emission vessels and finance green maritime infrastructure in developing countries.

What seemed like a clear path to decarbonization was derailed by geopolitics. The United States government’s return to Washington’s helm has brought a sharp reversal of U.S. climate diplomacy. Citing the framework as “anti-competitive” and “burdensome to American consumers,” the U.S. threatened punitive actions against supporting states, including sanctions, higher port fees for their flagged vessels, and even visa restrictions for their maritime officials.

Facing that pressure, 57 nations, led by Singapore and backed by Saudi Arabia, voted to delay the agreement for another year, while 49 opposed and 21 abstained. The hesitation underscores a familiar pattern: global climate ambition often collapses at the intersection of politics and profit.

In Africa, where 90% of trade by volume moves by sea, the implications are profound. The continent’s economies are acutely tied to maritime logistics; whether it’s Nigerian crude, Kenyan tea, or South African minerals. Yet Africa’s ports and shipping fleets remain among the least modernized and most carbon-intensive globally. According to the African Development Bank, fewer than 10% of African ports currently have the capacity to handle alternative fuels like green ammonia or methanol.

The IMO framework, with its promised financial support for clean technology transfer, could have positioned African nations to modernize fleets, upgrade port infrastructure, and create new green jobs across logistics chains. Its postponement therefore stalls not only a climate milestone but also an opportunity for Africa to participate in the trillion-dollar decarbonization economy.

Consider Durban, one of Africa’s busiest ports. Its annual throughput of over 2.8 million containers makes it a critical node in regional trade, yet its emissions profile is largely shaped by heavy fuel oil and outdated cargo handling systems. The city’s ongoing adaptation efforts, such as electrifying dock cranes and investing in LNG bunkering, represent early attempts at sustainability, but without global regulatory clarity, financing such initiatives becomes precarious.

A similar challenge faces Mombasa, which handles 1,700 ships annually and serves as East Africa’s maritime gateway. Kenya’s nascent plans to introduce low-sulphur fuel facilities could have received critical funding through the IMO’s Net-Zero Fund; now, those investments hang in limbo.

The suspension also threatens Africa’s voice in shaping the rules of future shipping. Many African countries, including Ghana, Egypt, and Seychelles, had aligned with the pro-framework bloc, viewing it as a vehicle for equity in global trade. The framework’s design included explicit provisions for a “just transition”, financial support for developing states to adapt without compromising competitiveness. The delay effectively sidelines these nations, reinforcing structural inequities that leave African ports reliant on outdated fleets even as global shipping giants, such as Maersk and MSC, accelerate their own private decarbonization projects.

The Danish shipping conglomerate Maersk, among the loudest critics of the delay, described the move as “a loss of momentum for the industry’s efforts to decarbonize.” Its first methanol-powered container ship began operations this year, signaling a shift among major players toward cleaner fuels. Yet without universal rules, the risk of a fragmented regulatory landscape grows. Wealthier states may adopt regional carbon schemes, like the European Union’s Emissions Trading System extension to shipping, while developing nations lag behind, facing potential trade penalties for non-compliance. This could mean higher freight costs for Africa, restricted access to certain ports, and growing inequality in maritime competitiveness.

The broader environmental consequences are no less severe. Africa’s 30,000-kilometer coastline already bears the brunt of rising seas and coastal erosion. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates that a one-meter sea level rise could displace over 40 million Africans by mid-century. Shipping emissions, though global in origin, intensify these local threats by accelerating climate instability. By deferring collective action, the IMO has effectively extended the continent’s exposure to both environmental and economic volatility.

Amidst the disappointment, there are still signs of resilience. Several African states are pressing ahead with regional initiatives: Morocco is developing a green hydrogen corridor with the EU; Namibia is constructing an ammonia export hub; and Egypt has begun pilot programs to retrofit ships with solar-hybrid propulsion systems on the Suez Canal. These efforts, though modest in scale, illustrate a recognition that Africa cannot afford to wait for global consensus to secure its maritime future.

Ultimately, the postponement of the IMO Net-Zero Framework underscores a larger truth about sustainability in the developing world: progress is rarely linear, and global politics often dictate the pace of change. The challenge posed for Africa now is to harness this delay not as defeat, but as a catalyst, to prepare its ports, fleets, and policies for the inevitable transition ahead. Because when the framework eventually returns to the table, the continent’s readiness, or lack thereof, will determine whether it rides the next wave of green trade, or is once again left at its mercy.",https://africasustainabilitymatters.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/The-true-cost-that-we-are-paying-to-ship-all-of-our-junk-across-the-ocean.jpeg,N,,2025-10-22 03:16:29.418987

The decision means that the proposed regulation will not come into force as originally scheduled in March 2027.

The IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) met in London on 14–17 October 2025. The extraordinary session of the Committee was to reach a final decision on globally binding Net-Zero Framework to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from shipping.

However, its adoption was postponed by at least one year. In the decisive vote, 57 IMO Member States supported the postponement, while 49 countries, including Finland, voted against it. A further 21 Member States abstained.

According to the jointly agreed EU policy, Finland was in favour of adopting global regulation at this session. Finland finds that this global emission reduction measure would have evened out the imbalance in international regulation of maritime emissions and levelled out the competitive environment, between the EU and the rest of the world, for business and industry that depend on shipping. Without globally coordinated action, the emission reduction targets set by the IMO cannot be met.

The goal of the IMO is to reach carbon neutrality in maritime transport by or around 2050 in a way that considers national circumstances. By 2030, greenhouse gas emissions from ships must be reduced by at least 20 per cent compared to 2008. The interim target set for 2040 is a reduction of at least 70 per cent.

What’s next?

The outcome of the session represents a setback both for efforts to reduce emissions from maritime transport and for the future of multilateral cooperation between states. The decision leaves the shipping industry without a global economic policy instrument or fuel standard that would be legally binding, both of which are considered crucial for the demand for more sustainable fuels and propulsion technologies.

The future of negotiations within the IMO on this matter remains uncertain. It is not yet clear what the starting point for further discussions will be. However, negotiations on certain technical guidelines specifying the proposed regulation package are expected to continue this week at the working group level.

Was it any wonder she admitted to “feeling a little intimidated.”

Procopiou had opened the panel discussion claiming that the IMO’s climate regulations were a kolotoumba, a Greek word meaning that they would achieve the opposite of the intended effect, raising costs and emissions.

Concerns The Chamber’s position paper had urged Ghana to refrain from voting for the framework until a detailed economic impact assessment was undertaken.
However, the Chamber cautioned that the country should also prepare diplomatically to engage with the IMO process to shape the final rules.","The Ghana Chamber of Shipping has described the International Maritime Organisation’s (IMO) decision to delay the adoption of its Net-Zero Framework (NZF) by one year as a prudent and necessary step that aligns with its earlier call for a pause to assess the policy’s potential impact on developing economies such as Ghana.

At the IMO’s recent extraordinary session in London last week, member states voted to postpone the final decision on the NZF until late 2026. The framework, which seeks to reduce emissions from international shipping through the setting of carbon intensity targets and a compliance mechanism, had been expected to enter into force in March 2027.

The delay follows growing concerns among developing countries about the economic implications of the proposed measures and the absence of clear guidelines for implementation.

Two weeks prior to the vote, the Ghana Chamber of Shipping had released a position paper warning that immediate adoption of the NZF would expose Ghana’s fragile, import-dependent economy to “yet unquantified economic impacts” without sufficient clarity on the pathways for mitigating those impacts.

The Chamber argued that the country’s largely ageing shipping fleet, low level of ship ownership, and limited alternative fuel capacity left it ill-prepared to meet the framework’s requirements.

Reacting to the outcome of the IMO vote, Stanley R. K. Ahorlu, a maritime lawyer and President of the Ghana Chamber of Shipping, said the decision “reflects reasoned restraint rather than delay.”

He noted that while some may view the postponement as a setback to global decarbonisation, for developing maritime states it represents “an opportunity to secure fairness before committing to long-term obligations.”

“For those who supported adoption now rather than later, the legal maxim ‘justice delayed is justice denied’ may resonate clearly,” Mr. Ahorlu said.

“But another equally important maxim—‘Fiat justitia et ruant coeli,’ meaning ‘let justice be done though the heavens fall’—captures the decision taken by many African states on this matter. We cannot simply ignore concerns around climate justice and equity in our quest to reduce emissions from shipping,” he added.

Concerns

The Chamber’s position paper had urged Ghana to refrain from voting for the framework until a detailed economic impact assessment was undertaken. It also warned that Ghana risked paying higher freight costs as shipping companies passed on new carbon charges, and that the framework’s technical and financial requirements could render much of the country’s existing fleet stranded.

According to the paper, Ghana’s beneficial ship ownership accounts for only 0.03 percent of global tonnage, meaning it would benefit little from the NZF’s reward mechanism for compliant shipowners. It further argued that the disbursement criteria of the Net Zero Fund, which is expected to finance fleet renewal and training, were yet to be developed, with the lack of clear line of sight to funds potentially leaving African operators at a disadvantage.

The Chamber also highlighted that Ghana forecasts show that by 2030, it was unlikely that Ghana would be able to produce even a third of the alternative fuels (biofuels or methanol) that its national fleet would require under the framework’s fuel transition rules, making the country’s near-term compliance technically challenging and financially costly.

Reassessment

The IMO’s postponement is seen by maritime analysts as a signal that the organization intends to address these concerns more comprehensively.

During the next year, working groups are expected to finalise operational guidelines on the framework including the zero and near-zero fuel lifecycle analysis, food security, and the Net Zero Fund; the latter being critical for determining eligibility criteria for accessing funding, as well as the approach to compensating economies facing disproportionate negative impacts from the implementation of the NZF.

Mr. Ahorlu said Ghana should use the intervening period to strengthen its policy and institutional capacity.

“While the pace may appear slow, the wheels of (climate) justice turn slowly but grind exceedingly fine,” he said, adding that Ghana must not waste the window of opportunity to develop a national decarbonisation roadmap.

Industry observers agree that the delay could benefit Ghana if properly used as it offers policymakers time to evaluate how the NZF will affect trade, shipping costs, and the country’s competitiveness, while also exploring opportunities in seafarer training and fleet modernisation.

However, the Chamber cautioned that the country should also prepare diplomatically to engage with the IMO process to shape the final rules.

After days of tense negotiations, the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) voted on Oct. 17 to defer discussions on the Net-Zero Framework (NZF) for one year.

The NZF outlines a global carbon-pricing scheme under which high-emission vessels would face penalties, while revenues would reward cleaner ships. The committee’s 176 member states had been expected to vote on its formal adoption, but instead considered a motion proposed by Saudi Arabia to postpone the debate for another year. The proposal passed with 57 votes in favor and 49 opposed. China, which had previously voiced support for the NZF, voted in favor of the delay.

“The delay leaves the shipping sector drifting in uncertainty,” Faig Abbasov, director of shipping at the environmental group Transport & Environment, told Reuters. Danish shipping company Maersk said the IMO’s decision marked a loss of momentum for the industry’s decarbonization efforts, adding that it will wait to see how the organization intends to continue the work on the framework, Reuters reported.

With the process now on hold, the question is what the industry should do during this gap year. According to Sherry Hu, carbon market analyst at RECCESSARY, the long-term trend toward decarbonization in the shipping industry remains unchanged.

Greece, one of the world’s leading shipping nations, took a cautious stance on the proposed International Maritime Organization (IMO) carbon tax.

In this context, the Greek minister of maritime affairs and insular policy, Vasilis Kikilias, in an official statement, underlined that shipping needs international, fair and realistic rules, accepted by all member states, and not punitive mechanisms that will endanger the stability of global trade.

As he noted, Greece, with its long naval tradition and the strongest fleet internationally, will play an active role in the new negotiations that will determine the final IMO framework for the green transition of shipping.

Greek minister of maritime affairs and insular policy, Vasilis Kikilias raised similar points few weeks ago in the Maritime Cyprus 2025 Conference in Limassol.

He called for improvements, stressing that more realistic timetables, fair treatment of transitional fuels and smarter use of reward mechanisms are needed.

The minister emphasized that “we agree on the framework, but we want realism. LNG has proven its reliability and must be utilized as a transitional fuel. We still do not have zero or near-zero emission fuels, not even to approach the reduction targets of the coming decade. The cost of the transition is very high, and a significant part of it must return to the shipping industry and the corresponding infrastructures.”

Some Greek shipowners, big names in the world shipping, long regarded as the industry’s traditionalists, publicly denounced the framework, calling it “unrealistic” and “detached from the commercial realities of global trade.”

While Greek shipowners are investing in cleaner technologies they remain wary of regulatory measures that could disrupt business models.

The Union of Greek Shipowners see the delay to reach an agreement on its Net-Zero Framework and the postponement of the decision until next year as a “new opportunity to shape a sustainable and effective international framework that will guide global shipping safely and realistically through the green transition.”

Athens, while acknowledging the agreement’s flaws, it says “is ready to lead constructively, with evidence-based and unifying proposals, in a global effort to shape a fair, practical and enforceable clean plan, where all stakeholders assume their share of responsibility on the collective path toward the green transition.”

“The lack of consensus highlighted deep rifts over the proposed Net-Zero Framework regulation, where the positions advanced by the shipping industry were not sufficiently taken into account,” the Greek shipowners union said in its statement.

As one of the top shipping nations, Greece plays a critical role in shaping global regulations. The challenge now is to find a path that balances environmental goals with economic realities, ensuring that the transition to clean shipping is both realistic and effective.

Statement of Greek minister of maritime affairs and insular policy, Vasilis Kikilias

“Shipping needs international rules accepted by all and not punitive mechanisms. Greece, as the largest power in global shipping, has always supported the IMO as the exclusive regulator of shipping rules. It raised its concern early on the so-called “zero emissions framework”, proposing significant improvements, so that it meets the real needs and capabilities of all shipping sectors and the reality of the global fuel market.

“The negotiations that followed have been arduous and have highlighted serious weaknesses in terms of implementation schedules, the unfair treatment of LNG fuel, and the unjustifiably high penalties on shipping which, if adopted, would probably cause serious disruptions in world trade and increases in product prices.

“The adoption of the final agreement has been postponed for a year, during which significant negotiations are required to take place among IMO members, integrating market views with realism and fairness. This is dictated by the need for energy security for both international shipping and global economic growth.

“Greece, with its great naval tradition, special know-how and the strongest fleet, will claim an important role in these negotiations for the framework under development.”

Statement of Union of Greek Shipowners

“Today’s decision to delay the process at the IMO presents a new opportunity to shape a sustainable and effective international framework that will guide global shipping safely and realistically through the green transition.

“The lack of consensus highlighted deep rifts over the proposed Net-Zero Framework regulation, where the positions advanced by the shipping industry were not sufficiently taken into account.

“Greek shipping remains firmly committed to the shared goal of decarbonisation and is ready to lead constructively, with evidence-based and unifying proposals, in a global effort to shape a fair, practical and enforceable clean plan, where all stakeholders assume their share of responsibility on the collective path toward the green transition.”",https://shippingtelegraph.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/KIKILIAS-4.png,N,,2025-10-21 22:20:25.325332

The two submarines operate the 83 MWe nuclear reactor.
But reports indicate that future orders will feature the 200 MWe reactor, helping to improve endurance at sea.","In the past two years, India has announced massive investments in its nuclear energy capacity. The focus currently is to design small modular reactors (SMRs) intended for use in off-grid sites in remote areas. However, local media reports this week indicate that the government wants to extend deployment of the SMRs to commercial shipping.

India’s Bhabha Atomic Research Center (BARC), run by the government, is developing two SMR designs of 55 MWe (megawatt electric) and 200 MWe capacities. The designs named as Bharat Small Modular Reactors (BSMRs) could be used as power plants in energy-intensive industries such as cement and steel manufacturing.

“The nuclear reactors are very safe and can even be used to power merchant ships,” reported the Business Standard newspaper, citing an unnamed senior government official. The Indian Navy has already embraced nuclear propulsion, with two nuclear submarines- INS Arihant and INS Arighaat. The two submarines operate the 83 MWe nuclear reactor. But reports indicate that future orders will feature the 200 MWe reactor, helping to improve endurance at sea.

Extending the technology to civil use, including merchant shipping, would help transform India’s domestic nuclear industry. With the shipping industry working to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions footprint, nuclear technology has been fronted to play a role in decarbonizing the sector. In June, IMO’s Marine Safety Committee endorsed revisions to the SOLAS convention to include new technologies such as SMRs.

Indeed, several technology providers are fast-tracking design and production of SMRs for commercial shipping. India sees this as a good opportunity and is even working on amendments to its nuclear energy laws to include the private sector. In the past year, India has also renewed nuclear cooperation with the U.S. and France. The focus is to build its capacity for designing and producing SMRs and Advanced Modular Reactor (AMR).",https://maritime-executive.com/media/images/article/Photos/Vessels_Concepts/C-Job-future-nuclear-ships.jpg,N,,2025-10-21 23:21:01.732848

The Bahamas has become the second CARICOM country to not vote in support of a Net-Zero Shipping Framework (NZF), which aims to reduce emissions in the maritime sector.

Earlier, Antigua and Barbuda Prime Minister Gaston Browne said St. John’s did not favor voting in support of the measure being pushed by the International Maritime Organization (IMO), which was approved in April this year.

“Like the United States, we are equally concerned about this transition, and we think there should be a deferral, and if there is no deferral, then we clearly will abstain,” Browne told the state-owned ABS.

“We will not vote against it because at the end of the day, we are one of the most strident climate advocates as we have been advocating for net-zero, so we do not want to undermine our overall position on this transition to renewables and to achieve net-zero as soon as possible,” Browne said.

“The Bahamas had some time ago written to the IMO to ask for the vote to be postponed, and if the vote is not postponed, we expect to abstain,” said Foreign Affairs Minister Fred Mitchell.

IMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez said that while the IMO Net-Zero Framework “is not perfect,” it “provides a balanced basis for our further work ahead of its entry into force in 2027.”

“This process has been inclusive and thorough,” Dominguez added, urging delegates to approach the talks “with diplomacy and respect.”

Grenada

The Grenadian government suggests establishing a trilateral joint commission with Venezuela, St. Vincent, and the Grenadines to guide the process of separating maritime boundaries.

“Grenada has also started an initiative to delimit the maritime boundaries with Venezuela, St. Vincent and the Grenadines. We completed the process, you know, with Trinidad and Tobago back in 2012. We have never been clear on what the boundary is between Grenada and Venezuela, and what the boundary is between St Vincent and Grenada,” said Nazim Burke, chairman of Grenada’s oil and gas Technical Working Group (TWG).

Burke, who provided an update on the TWG activities during a town hall meeting, said, “What has happened is that our prime minister has put forward a proposal to the President of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and the Prime Minister of St. Vincent for the establishment of a trilateral commission, a joint trilateral commission that will be comprised of 10 people.”

“In essence, there will be three people from each of the three countries and a chairman from another country that will guide this process and work towards the completion of the boundaries between our three countries,” he said, adding that leasing property, whether on land or sea, would require the owner to know the boundary. “It is a very important step as well because you cannot go about leasing out land to people without knowing where your boundary is, you cannot go about leasing out maritime space to people without knowing where your boundaries are,” he said.

Burke told the town hall meeting that during the past six months, the TWG members have been holding discussions with relevant stakeholders, including Trinidad and Tobago and other companies, which have conducted research and have spatial vector data about Grenada’s oil and gas.

Guyana

The Guyana government has welcomed the United Kingdom Export Finance’s (UKEF) decision to increase its financing capacity for Guyana from £2.1 billion to £3 billion.

Minister of Finance Dr. Ashni K. Singh commended the significant increase and described it as a powerful signal of London’s “strong and growing confidence” in Guyana’s robust economic trajectory.

The UK government announced a recent high-level meeting between President Irfaan Ali and a visiting delegation, including UKEF representatives and the Deputy Trade Commissioner for Latin America and the Caribbean, Jonathan Knott.

“The enhanced support from UKEF is expected to assist in ramping up development in priority sectors identified by the government of Guyana over the next five years.

Furthermore, according to a government statement, “Guyana’s private sector is also expected to benefit from additional financing to expand its operations and form strategic partnerships with British companies.”

Singh expressed gratitude on behalf of the Guyana government for Britain’s support over the years, “which has been instrumental in fostering collaboration between the two nations, as Guyana continues to accelerate its development and solidify its position as a leading investment hub in the region.”

Jamaica

LANDS, the emerging political movement in Jamaica, has expressed deep concern over the increasing militarization of the Caribbean, facilitated by governments that publicly commit to maintaining the region as a Zone of Peace while quietly enabling foreign military involvement.

In a strongly worded statement, the group criticized Caribbean leaders for allowing foreign powers to deploy military hardware in the region and for collaborating with the United States Southern Command (SouthCom) on security operations.

“Our leaders go abroad to deliver poetic rhetoric about peace and sovereignty, yet their domestic actions contradict those promises,” the statement read. “These fine words may make good headlines, but they do nothing to protect the people who continue to suffer under the shadow of foreign military influence.”

The movement warned that the Caribbean risks becoming entangled in the same kind of devastation seen in other conflict zones, comparing it with US-backed military interventions in Iraq, Afghanistan, and, more recently, Gaza, arguing that similar policies of militarization and foreign control could have grave consequences for small island nations.

The statement also highlighted the ongoing crisis in Haiti.

“After supporting coups and foreign missions that deepened Haiti’s suffering, some Caribbean governments are now opening the door to more of the same,” the group said. “These are the same forces that cannot be trusted to offer real solutions.”

The movement further criticized the deployment of US naval fleets in the Caribbean, ostensibly to combat drug trafficking, saying such missions allow foreign soldiers to operate freely in regional waters, sometimes harassing local fisher folk and limiting their livelihoods.

The group warned that normalizing such activity could pave the way for deeper foreign control. “How long before the same country that floods our region with guns deploys troops within our borders – claiming to fight crime or protect democracy?” the statement asked.

Calling on CARICOM to “grow a spine” and assert regional sovereignty, the movement urged leaders to prioritize the interests of Caribbean people over foreign powers.

St. Kitts & Nevis

The St. Kitts and Nevis government has welcomed a decision by the St. Vincent and the Grenadines-based Lynch Caribbean Brokers Ltd to include the twin-island federation in the Regional Economic Agri-Insurance Program (REAP).

This was announced during the recently concluded 19th Caribbean Week of Agriculture (CWA 2025). Agriculture, Fisheries and Marine Resources Minister Samal Duggins said the insurance program should be a vital pillar for national resilience and regional innovation.

“Agriculture and fisheries remain at the heart of our nation’s food security, livelihoods, and economic resilience. Yet, farmers and fishers are increasingly vulnerable to risks beyond their control – climate change, unpredictable weather patterns, natural disasters, pests, and market volatility,” he added.

Under the REAP project, local farmers and fishers are expected to benefit from a regional insurance program that aims to reduce their vulnerability to natural disasters, market volatility, and the growing impacts of climate change.

REAP, developed by Lynch Caribbean Brokers Ltd of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, will soon be launched in St. Kitts in partnership with the government through the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Marine Resources.

Caribbean Lynch Brokers managing director, Damian Bowen, said that the program’s design was shaped by extensive national consultation, adding that “REAP’s development was the result of careful collaboration with key stakeholders during the first quarter of 2025.

“Together with experts from the Ministry of Agriculture and members of the farming and fishing communities, we created a model tailored to real needs rather than abstract assumptions.”

REAP is expected to introduce livelihood protection, a national enrollment campaign, public education seminars, and digital dashboards that improve transparency and data-driven decision-making.

Duggins said the government is committed to strengthening resilience across the agriculture and fisheries sectors.",https://www.caribbeanlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/caribbean-roundup-2025-10-23-dr-cl01.jpg?quality=51&w=1085&p=q,N,,2025-10-21 18:16:28.466647

The carbon tax aimed to penalize shipping companies who operated vessels that ran on the current industry standard, very low sulfur fuel oil (VLSFO).
This suggests that stopping an IMO regulation is rare, but derailing it once can prevent it from being adopted anytime soon.
On Thursday, President Trump himself weighed in: “I am outraged that the International Maritime Organization is voting in London this week to pass a global Carbon Tax.
“I can say it was a knife fight to the end.” While the U.S. did not outright kill the carbon tax, even delaying the vote represented a major diplomatic accomplishment.","The latest attempted U.N. power grab just got Trumped. The International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) first-of-its-kind plan to impose a global carbon tax on maritime shipping companies seemed like a cinch heading into last week’s extraordinary session — until it rammed full-steam into an uncharted American iceberg. Elections have consequences, and this administration will not surrender America’s sovereignty to unaccountable international bureaucrats.

On Friday, the IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) voted 57-49 to table the carbon tax regulation for a full 12 months, a dramatic reversal from the regulation’s 63-16 victory in a preliminary vote this April. What made the difference was resolute opposition from the Trump administration, which found a convenient ally in Saudi Arabia.

As IMO Secretary General Arsenio Dominguez, of Panama, concluded Friday’s session, he “looked like a deer in the headlights,” observed one delegate. “My plea to you is not to repeat the way we have negotiated this week,” Dominguez complained. “This was not the normal IMO meeting,” he added. “Be nice and kind to each other. It doesn’t cost much.”

The functionary’s choice of words was disastrously inaccurate. In this case, the cost of being too nice was both quantifiable and unacceptably high. The carbon tax aimed to penalize shipping companies who operated vessels that ran on the current industry standard, very low sulfur fuel oil (VLSFO). The steep tax was calculated to make VLSFO just as expensive as non-carbon-based fuels (such as green ammonia, which is currently two to four times as expensive).

Thus, the U.N. proposed to dramatically raise the cost of maritime fuel, a major cost input of all maritime shipping, which accounts for 90% of all international trade. The regulation would have raised the costs of all imported goods for Americans by as much as 10% — as much again as Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs.

In addition to the economic burden, approving such a regulation would also concede the principle that the U.N. may lay and collect taxes on private companies like any national government, a massive concession of sovereignty that would lead to any number of unforeseeable consequences in the future. “This is a bigger deal than I think anybody realizes,” U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Mike Waltz said before the Friday vote.

As for being “nice and kind,” the IMO traditionally makes decisions by consensus, which is a nice way of saying that some entrenched powers make all the decisions, and everyone else is compelled to play along. The IMO rarely even has to call a vote on the rules it adopts.

Both national governments and the shipping industry itself had endorsed the regulation, which seems to be an attempt by European nations to standardize their own costly green energy policies for the world. Dominguez was apparently affronted by the Trump administration’s importation of adversarial politics to obstruct this sinister scheme.

“I’ve been in this industry for 30 years and I’ve never seen anything like it,” said one shipping executive. “You just don’t say NO to these guys. It’s unheard of.” For a similar precedent, one would have to reach back to 1984, when the IMO failed to adopt a draft of the International Convention on Liability and Compensation for Damage in Connection with the Carriage of Hazardous and Noxious Substances by Sea (HNS Convention). A revised draft did not reemerge for another 10 years, and in 2009 the convention has still not entered into effect. This suggests that stopping an IMO regulation is rare, but derailing it once can prevent it from being adopted anytime soon.

Indeed, the extraordinary usurpation of sovereignty conceived in the IMO scheme impelled delegates to extraordinary measures to defend the citizens of their own nations. Before the IMO meeting, three U.S. cabinet secretaries published a joint statement threatening retaliatory sanctions, tariffs, and other economic measures for any nation who voted for the maritime carbon tax. On Thursday, President Trump himself weighed in:

“I am outraged that the International Maritime Organization is voting in London this week to pass a global Carbon Tax. The United States will NOT stand for this Global Green New Scam Tax on Shipping, and will not adhere to it in any way, shape, or form. We will not tolerate increased prices on American Consumers OR, the creation of a Green New Scam Bureaucracy to spend YOUR money on their Green dreams. Stand with the United States, and vote NO in London tomorrow!”

“That Trump Truth Social post sent shockwaves through the building,” confessed one delegate at the IMO session in London.

Beyond these external threats, the United States and other nations with similar interests engaged in what one shipping publication, GCaptain, called “delay tactics and procedural sabotage.” For example, the U.S. proposed to change the IMO’s adoption process to require “explicit” adoption, so that each nation that was party to existing protocols would have to individually approve the amended regulations.

In these negotiations, the U.S. played an excellent “bad cop” to Saudi Arabia’s “good cop.” While America threatened tariffs and acted tough, Saudi Arabia promised sweetheart economic deals and offered compromises. The two-pronged strategy convinced China to change its vote, while Greece, Cyprus, Japan, and South Korea — who has supported the regulations in April — abstained.

Eventually, the IMO voted to table the measure, rather than vote it up or down. An up-or-down vote would have required a two-thirds majority to pass and, if unsuccessful, would have killed the regulation for good. Instead, the vote to table means that the regulation can return for another vote in 12 months’ time.

Singapore advanced the motion to table, and Saudi Arabia called it to a vote. The motion to table was a close affair, passing 57 to 49, with 21 countries abstaining. If only five nations flipped their votes, or nine nations who abstained had voted, the outcome would have been different.

GCaptain CEO John Konrad reported that the negotiations continued down to the wire. “I can’t share the details on how @michaelgwaltz & @SecRubio have, in just a few days, organized the greatest opposition to UN policy since the Cold War and blocked this UN Carbon Tax,” he wrote. “I can say it was a knife fight to the end.”

While the U.S. did not outright kill the carbon tax, even delaying the vote represented a major diplomatic accomplishment. More than that, it will also push back the earliest possible implementation of the regulation — even if it passes next October — to 2030, complicating the aggressive timeline for the world’s shipping fleet to reach “Net Zero” carbon emissions by 2050. This might send international bureaucrats back to the drawing board entirely.

Industry players have chosen to gripe about Trump saving their bacon, betraying an ideological commitment to climate change ideology. But one line from analysts at Jeffries’ investment bank concedes the real point. “If there is one benefit to the IMO’s stalled initiatives,” they admitted, “it is that shipping costs may be coming down.”

For American families, that is the whole goal — why isn’t it a goal for the IMO?

“This is another HUGE win for @POTUS,” declared U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio. “Thanks to his leadership, the United States prevented a massive UN tax hike on American consumers that would have funded progressive climate pet projects. Our country will continue to lead the way and put America FIRST.”

Even his opponents seem ready to grant that this victory is one Trump earned. “Absolutely none of the maritime experts I interviewed early this week thought the US could pull this off. Zero. Massive amounts of money, NGO influence, diplomatic threat and media manipulation were behind this,” summarized Konrad. “And yet Trump did it.”",https://www.frc.org/img/domain/frc/item/AE25J119_NORMAL.jpg,N,,2025-10-21 18:16:33.388045

Shipping companies were also caught off guard. “It was disappointing,” said Morten Christiansen, senior vice president and head of decarbonization at Danish shipping giant Maersk, during a press conference in São Paulo earlier that day. “We’re losing time,” he warned, attributing the delay to “political tensions,” but adding that “it’s not the end for ethanol at the IMO.”

Mr. Christiansen, who took part in the IMO discussions, described Friday’s meeting as “unusual.” “We’re still trying to understand what happened. I hope there will be another meeting within a year,” he said, although he cautioned that there is a “high risk” that ethanol’s classification may not move forward.

Some producers sought to downplay the impact. “The postponement isn’t necessarily bad news,” said Gustavo Mariano, vice president of trading at Inpasa. “It gives us more time to demonstrate ethanol’s potential as a viable alternative,” he told reporters.

Despite the IMO’s decision, Maersk said it will continue testing ethanol blends in its marine fuels. Trials with methanol-powered engines are expected to conclude Thursday, with encouraging results so far. Other maritime technology companies, including Finland’s Wärtsilä and Switzerland’s WinGD, are also developing ship engines capable of running on ethanol.

To underscore its commitment, Maersk issued a joint statement with Brazil’s five largest ethanol producers—Raízen, Copersucar, Atvos, FS, and Inpasa—pledging to advance ethanol as a sustainable marine fuel. The declaration was released Monday (20) morning.

Industry estimates suggest that blending ethanol into just 10% of the global marine fuel supply would create annual demand for about 50 billion liters. While the potential is significant, Mr. Campos of Bioenergia Brasil said certification alone would not open the market immediately. “It takes time to replace all the necessary equipment,” he noted.

The IMO’s technical committee is expected to continue debating ethanol’s inclusion as an approved sustainable fuel. According to Arnaldo Jardim, vice president of Brazil’s Congressional Agricultural Front (FPA), who spoke at the Datagro conference, “the work to secure ethanol’s certification next year must start right now.”

Compared with alternatives such as e-methanol, ammonia, and even green hydrogen, ethanol entered the IMO’s decarbonization debate later. Danilo Veras, vice president for regulatory policy at Maersk Latin America, said this delay stems partly from ethanol’s production complexity. Life-cycle analysis plays a key role, requiring accounting for emissions at every stage, from crop cultivation to fuel combustion, he said.

From their various achievements in clean zero emissions and technology and continued efforts, here are a few notable projects and milestones that have solidified the Port of San Diego as a “Port of Firsts.”

A Legacy of Famous Firsts

First all-electric mobile harbor cranes in North America. The two Konecranes Generation 6 Mobile Harbor Cranes are transforming the way the U.S. West Coast handles cargo with their superior performance and fast offloading speeds.

When used in tandem, the Port’s all-electric mobile harbor cranes boast the highest lift capacity on the U.S. West Coast. The bigger the lift, the bigger the cargo. The arrival of this technology affects a variety of industries that require large equipment. Now, the U.S. West Coast can seamlessly move ship engines to shipyards for repair or building.

First all-electric tugboat, operated by Crowley Maritime. Specifically designed to support maritime operations at the Port, the eWolf is an 82-foot vessel with 70 tons of bollard pull and is a historic milestone for the maritime industry.

Fun Fact: Over the first 10 years of its use, the new eTug will reduce 178 tons of nitrogen oxide, 2.5 tons of diesel particulate matter, and 3,100 metric tons of carbon dioxide versus a conventional tug.

Among the first in the United States to install shore power for ocean going vessels. The Port put its first shore power connection at the cruise terminals into service in 2010, making it among the first ports in California to have shore power available for cruise ships and beating a state regulation to reduce diesel particulate emissions from at least 50 percent of cruise calls by nearly four years.

Among the first ports to adopt a Climate Action Plan. In 2013, the Port adopted a Climate Action Plan to provide a long-term vision for sustainability by decreasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

Upcoming: Zero Emissions (ZE) Truck Charging Facility

The pursuit of technological innovation does not stop at the Port of San Diego.

Greenhouse gas emissions from shipping account for about 3% of total emissions worldwide.
The regulations would set a marine fuel standard on the amount of greenhouse gas emissions allowed from fuels used in shipping.
The U.S maritime industry believes the global tax would cost American shippers more than $100 billion over the next seven years, if enacted.
However, the theory of a carbon tax becomes fraught when dealing with real-world politics.","The world’s largest maritime nations met in London last week to consider adopting regulations that would set a global tax on greenhouse gas emissions from shipping for ships of all types — cargo and cruise. In April, members of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) agreed on the contents of the regulatory framework and intended to adopt it at the meeting. However, the Trump administration’s pressure — through threats of tariffs, visa restrictions, and financial penalties, alongside arguments about potential costs and national security risks — convinced nations to vote to delay a decision on the framework by a year. According to the Associated Press, if the IMO agreed to the regulation, it would have been the first global tax on greenhouse gas emissions. The proposal would have entered into force beginning in 2027, with a target for reaching net zero emissions in 2050. Greenhouse gas emissions from shipping account for about 3% of total emissions worldwide.

The system for compliance is essentially a cap and trade program with an associated pricing system that would impose fees for every ton of greenhouse gases emitted by ships above allowable limits. Via the Associated Press, there is a base level target of compliance for the allowable greenhouse gas intensity of fuels and there is a more stringent direct compliance target that requires further reduction in the greenhouse gas intensity. Greenhouse gas fuel intensity measures the amount of greenhouse gases emitted per unit of energy used.

The regulations would set a marine fuel standard on the amount of greenhouse gas emissions allowed from fuels used in shipping. The standard would decrease over time, making it more difficult to meet. Fees would be imposed on the greenhouse gases emitted above the standard. As explained by the Associated Press, ships that have lower emissions than the compliance target earn “surplus units,” or credits. Ships with emissions above the standard would have to buy credits from ships having credits or from the IMO at $380 per metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent. Additionally, there’s a penalty of $100 per metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent to reach direct compliance.

Via the Associated Press, the fees could generate $11 billion to $13 billion in revenue in the first year. The revenues are to go into an IMO fund to invest in fuels and technologies needed to transition to net zero, reward low-emission ships, and support developing countries in making the transition. The rules are designed to make biofuels the cheapest fuel to use for compliance, as the fees to meet the standards close the cost gap between fossil fuels and alternative fuels such as ammonia, hydrogen, and methanol.

Since large ships operate for about 25 years, the industry would need to make changes and investments now to reach net-zero at the target date around 2050. According to FreightWaves, Ocean carriers for years have been proactive in reducing emissions. About 41% of container ships on order – more than half the tonnage on order — are designed to operate with alternative fuels such as liquefied natural gas or ammonia.

Before the vote, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Energy Secretary Chris Wright, and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy jointly said that the Trump administration “unequivocally rejects” the maritime proposal. The U.S maritime industry believes the global tax would cost American shippers more than $100 billion over the next seven years, if enacted.

Analysis

In addition to violating the sovereignty of nations to impose their own taxes, a global tax on greenhouse gas emissions from ships would have imposed immense costs on the industry, which is responsible for 90% of global trade and only produces 3% of carbon emissions. Carbon taxes and cap and trade programs are often sold as a common-sense policy solution to transition carbon-intensive industries towards low- or zero-carbon alternatives. However, the theory of a carbon tax becomes fraught when dealing with real-world politics. As IER’s Samuel Peterson and Alex Stevens wrote for the National Interest, “Carbon taxes are frequently presented as scientifically sound and politically feasible tools for climate mitigation. However, they are fraught with methodological, political, and economic challenges that warrant serious reconsideration.”",https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/bigstock-Cargo-Boat-Close-Up-1851648-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-10-21 20:16:37.904614

However, as we move further away from the age of sails, the global shipping industry has become one of the biggest polluters of our planet.
These measures, set to be formally adopted in October this year before entry into force in 2027, will become mandatory for large ocean-going ships over 5,000 gross tonnages, which emit 85% of the total CO2 emissions from international shipping.
Currently, MARPOL’s Annex VI has 108 parties, covering 97% of the world’s merchant shipping fleet by tonnage, and already includes mandatory energy efficiency requirements for ships.
During the IMO MEPC meeting, Members voted to postpone approving a plan to curb shipping emissions.","The oceans are the source of life and the great unifier of our distant civilisations. Civilisations are built on trade and relations, much of which happens via shipping, today. Over the last few centuries, sea trade and Naval power have redefined the global order and landscape. However, as we move further away from the age of sails, the global shipping industry has become one of the biggest polluters of our planet. Many attempts have been made to address this issue; progress has been slow. This week, fresh attempts have been made on the global stage, only to be pushed back by a handful of powerful nations, who would rather see their ill-advised short-term progress and geopolitical contests succeed, over the long-term safety of the planet and our oceans.

The International Maritime Organisation (IMO) was pushing a new piece of international legislation to establish a legally binding framework to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from ships globally, aiming for net-zero emissions by or around a target year of 2050. The effort, championed by many small coastal states, scientists, academia and some segments of the industry, was expected to become the first in the world to combine mandatory emission limits and GHG pricing across an entire industry sector. The legislation is named the IMO Net-zero Framework. This legislation was first approved by the Marine Environment Protection Committee during its 83rd session (MEPC 83) from 7-11 April this year, and they include a new fuel standard for ships and a global pricing mechanism for emissions. These measures, set to be formally adopted in October this year before entry into force in 2027, will become mandatory for large ocean-going ships over 5,000 gross tonnages, which emit 85% of the total CO2 emissions from international shipping. The legislation also included a new chapter on prevention of air pollution from ships to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL). Currently, MARPOL’s Annex VI has 108 parties, covering 97% of the world’s merchant shipping fleet by tonnage, and already includes mandatory energy efficiency requirements for ships.

The key elements of the IMO Net-Zero Framework would require ships to comply with: “Global fuel standard: Ships must reduce, over time, their annual greenhouse gas fuel intensity (GFI) – that is, how much GHG is emitted for each unit of energy used. This is calculated using a well-to-wake approach. A global economic measure: Ships emitting above GFI thresholds will have to acquire remedial units to balance its deficit emissions, while those using zero or near-zero GHG technologies will be eligible for financial rewards,” the IMO said.

Meanwhile, to ensure compliance, the legislation would have two levels of compliance with GHG Fuel Intensity targets: a Base Target and a Direct Compliance Target at which ships would be eligible to earn ‘surplus units’. This would allow ships that emit above the set thresholds to balance their emissions deficit by, either transferring surplus units from other ships; using surplus units they have already banked, or using remedial units acquired through contributions to the IMO Net-Zero Fund.

However, an extraordinary session of the Marine Environment Protection Committee of the IMO which met recently was to seek its members approval for the new legislation and to amend the MARPOL. But alas, this progressive step towards making our globe more sustainable and safer was torpedoed by the US President Donald Trump, whose verbal sabre rattling threatened the IMO Member Nations not to move forward with the first of its kind global carbon tax, and threatened to impose sanctions on countries that supported the measure. During the IMO MEPC meeting, Members voted to postpone approving a plan to curb shipping emissions. The coerced postponement of the adoption of shipping carbon tax is a clear sight of how ‘might is right’ has overshadowed the ‘rules-based order’ and the multilateralism which many small states like Sri Lanka is dependent on to avoid being treaded on by powerful nations. Sri Lanka, despite its weak economic standing, and market-risk, should at least find the guts to voice its concern about such blackmail by powerful nations such as the United States. If we keep quiet, what more will we be forced to endure? Afterall, it is small coastal states like Sri Lanka that have to face the brunt of climate change and the rise of ocean levels due to global warming.",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/the-morning-39270.appspot.com/o/articles%2F7RFv2vD96kbZCEvm6aY4?alt=media&token=a52641cb-36ef-407d-88fb-71b12b5752bd,N,,2025-10-21 15:16:32.965669

We are sorry to have witnessed it, and the country and the world should not have to witness it again.
Locsin should resign his IMO post at once, or if he has not the grace to do that, be removed from it.","IT is with great regret that we must share this update to our editorial of Oct. 15, in which we anticipated the adoption by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) of what would have been the world’s first-ever legally binding global emissions reduction and carbon tax framework, aimed at eliminating 1 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually by 2050. The landmark agreement, the draft of which was approved by the IMO Marine Environment Protection Committee at its meeting in April, was expected to pass easily at the IMO’s main meeting in London last week.

As you may have guessed by this point, that is not what happened. While passage of the IMO Net-Zero Framework was assured going into the meeting, the shocking result was instead a hastily passed resolution to delay a decision on adopting the agreement for at least 12 months. The reason for this was a tantrum thrown by United States President Donald Trump, naturally by way of his personal soapbox, the Truth Social network, threatening US sanctions against any country that voted in favor of the agreement.

“I am outraged that the International Maritime Organization is voting in London this week to pass a global carbon tax,” Trump fumed in his post. “The United States will NOT stand for this global green new scam tax on shipping.” Trump said that the US would impose sanctions on any country — there are 176 IMO members — that voted to adopt the agreement. While these were not specified, it is presumed, per several media reports, that these might include additional port restrictions and fees, as well as visa restrictions.

That harangue by a babbling madman did not sway many IMO representatives, but there were unfortunately enough of them who lacked courage, and respect for their countries’ and the world’s best interests to be cowed by Trump’s bullying, so that the resolution to defer action on the draft agreement was passed by a vote of 57 to 49. To our great shame, one who stood out for his fecklessness in reversing the Philippines’ original approval of the draft to kowtow to the whims of the climate change-denying, would-be US dictator was our own permanent representative to the IMO, Ambassador Teodoro Locsin Jr. Locsin, who is also the Philippines’ ambassador to the United Kingdom, is not just our IMO representative, but was overwhelmingly elected to the IMO Council for the 2024-2025 term.

Locsin’s action stands in stark contradiction to the policy and principles of the Philippines, policy and principles that are, in fact, codified in our laws, with respect to action on climate change. Betrayal is a strong word, but it might not be out of place here, particularly because it is very likely the Philippines would stand to gain materially from implementation of the IMO Net-Zero Framework. Under the framework, the carbon taxes paid by shippers exceeding their emissions limits would be gathered in a fund to be redistributed as incentives to those keeping their emissions below the agreed thresholds, and to finance climate adaptation and mitigation projects and research, with a priority on climate-vulnerable and lower-income countries. Beyond that, the progressive reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from shipping will have a direct positive effect on the well-being of our maritime environment, and the health of the hundreds of thousands of Filipinos who man the world’s shipping fleets.

Not only has Locsin failed to uphold the interests of the Philippines and our men and women whose work carries them between ports around the globe, his reversal of the Philippines’ approval of the Net-Zero Framework draft is a discredit to the leadership position he holds within the IMO. It takes a special kind of faithlessness to forget that one has the backing of not only a maritime nation of 117 million people but also the organization representing 97 percent of the world’s commercial shipping, and instead choose to be quailed by one small man’s puerile threats.

The proposal, supported by 63 countries — including the EU, Brazil, China, India, Canada, the U.K., South Korea, and Japan — was slated for formal adoption this October.
“This decision represents a failure by the IMO to act decisively on the climate crisis.","In a major setback to global climate action, member states of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) — including India — have agreed to postpone a key vote on implementing a strategy to transition the shipping industry toward carbon neutrality by 2050. The delay came after strong pressure from the United States, which has opposed the proposed framework for new fuel standards and carbon pricing.

The IMO’s sub-committee had earlier, in April, endorsed a plan to introduce a global fuel standard for ships and establish a carbon pricing mechanism beginning in 2027. The proposal, supported by 63 countries — including the EU, Brazil, China, India, Canada, the U.K., South Korea, and Japan — was slated for formal adoption this October. Sixteen countries, led by the United States, had voted against it.

However, tensions escalated ahead of the October 17 meeting in London. U.S. President Donald Trump openly condemned the plan on his social media platform, Truth Social, calling it a “Global Green New Scam Tax on Shipping.” He warned that the U.S. would “not adhere to it in any way” and urged other nations to vote against what he described as a “tax on American consumers.”

As discussions began on October 14, negotiations quickly grew contentious. Singapore proposed deferring the decision by a year, a move that Saudi Arabia pushed to a formal vote. In the final tally, 57 countries supported the delay, 49 opposed it, and 21 abstained. It remains unclear how India voted.

Climate-vulnerable nations voiced strong disappointment over the outcome. “We regret that IMO members accepted Singapore’s proposal to delay adoption of the framework by 12 months,” said Ralph Regenvanu, Minister for Climate Change of Vanuatu. “This decision represents a failure by the IMO to act decisively on the climate crisis. The delay makes our path to Bélem and beyond much harder, but we will continue to fight for our people and our planet.”",https://www.maritimegateway.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Global-carbon-shipping-delay-vote.jpeg,N,,2025-10-21 13:16:43.451647

Negotiations on the first-ever global climate agreement for an entire industry have just been kicked into the long grass in London. Danish Shipping calls it “a major disappointment.”

“This is not what we came for. We came here to finally conclude a crucial climate agreement for international shipping. We from the Danish side have worked tirelessly towards this for a long time, so it’s a big disappointment.”

That is the clear conclusion from Danish Shipping’s CEO, Anne H. Steffensen, following dramatic developments at the UN’s International Maritime Organization (IMO).

This week, member states gathered in London to finally adopt the Net Zero Framework agreement, which was initially reached back in April. The agreement aims to bring international shipping emissions down to net zero by 2050. Until very recently, that deal appeared secure. But after two days of stalled talks in the negotiation room, the IMO has chosen to postpone the vote on the agreement.

“Much has happened in the world since 2023, when the framework for the strategy was adopted. Unfortunately, that means there have been all sorts of other agendas in the negotiation room besides climate. Geopolitical tensions and a new world order have made their way in – also at the IMO,” said Anne H. Steffensen.

The agreement would have had a positive effect on the price gap between fossil fuels and alternative fuels, which are essential for the transition of shipping. Today, alternative fuels are three to four times more expensive than fossil fuels, and production remains at a very low level, particularly in Europe.

“Shipping still urgently needs global regulation and a clear plan for the green transition. That’s necessary to support investments in new green ships and the green fuels we need to sail on. Unfortunately, there wasn’t enough political will in the room to finish the job this week. But where there’s life, there’s hope. The work for shipping’s green transition continues,” said Anne H. Steffensen.

IMO’s Net Zero Framework:

The agreement includes, among other things, a requirement for the gradual reduction of the greenhouse gas intensity of the fuels ships use. Ships that emit more than allowed will have to pay, while the most energy-efficient vessels can earn and trade surplus units, as well as receive rewards for using green fuels. Emitting greenhouse gases will become more expensive – and reducing them will pay off.

The Intersessional Working Group on the Reduction on Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Ships, which is scheduled to meet this week, will stay the course and work on the guidelines for implementing the NZF. Maritime shipping accounts for roughly 3 percent of human-caused global greenhouse gas emissions.

The move came a day after President Donald Trump expressed his “outrage” over the deal on his Truth Social platform, saying that the United States “would NOT stand for this Global Green New Scam Tax on Shipping, and will not adhere to it in any way, shape or form.”

Writing in a joint statement last week, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said that the United States was mulling possible action against countries that backed the measure, including initiating antitrust probes and sanctions, imposing additional port fees and other penalties on their ships, and perhaps even blocking vessels registered in those countries from U.S. ports.

They said that the agreement would unduly or unfairly burden the United States, harm the interests of the American people and raise global shipping costs by as much as 10 percent. While the United States walked out of April’s deliberations over a draft agreement, Russia and Saudi Arabia joined in its dissent at the time by voting against the measure. All three pressed for the framework’s delayed adoption.

“The United States will be moving to levy these remedies against nations that sponsor this European-led neocolonial export of global climate regulations,” the officials wrote. “We will fight hard to protect our economic interests by imposing costs on countries if they support the NZF. Our fellow IMO members should be on notice.”

In a terse response two days later, the European Commission said that it was in favor of efforts to decarbonize the shipping sector and level the global playing field.

UN spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric told reporters in New York that Secretary-General António Guterres saw Friday’s decision as a “missed opportunity for member states to place the shipping sector on a clear, credible path toward net-zero emissions.”

It was only in September that Trump, a longtime fossil fuel proponent who made “drill, baby, drill” a frequent campaign slogan, told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly that climate change was the “greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world.”

“All of these predictions made by the United Nations and many others, often for bad reasons, were wrong,” he said. “They were made by stupid people that have cost their countries fortunes and given those same countries no chance for success. If you don’t get away from this green scam, your country is going to fail.”

Earlier this month, the White House nixed $7.6 billion in grants that underpinned hundreds of clean energy projects in more than a dozen states—all of which voted for the Democratic opponent, Kamala Harris, in last year’s presidential election.

“President Trump promised to protect taxpayer dollars and expand America’s supply of affordable, reliable, and secure energy,” Wright had said. “Today’s cancellations deliver on that commitment.”

The NZF would require cargo ships weighing 5,000 gross tonnage or more to pay a fee if their carbon emissions exceed a certain mandatory limit, thereby incentivizing cleaner fuels and technologies. Collected revenue would be used to reward low-emissions ships, mitigate negative impacts on vulnerable member states and support innovation and research in developing countries. If the measure had gone through, it would have marked the first time a legally binding global carbon price was levied on any sector.

A missed opportunity aside, the delay is also a “setback” that will derail innovation, deepen inequities and render more difficult and expensive the transition to clean shipping, said Natacha Stamatiou, global shipping and IMO delegation lead at the nonprofit Environmental Defense Fund.

“We know progress is possible when governments act together; now they have the opportunity to prove it,” she said in a statement. “We cannot afford to wait any longer. It is vital that member states return to the negotiating table and deliver a measure that reflects wise ambition—one that delivers a just and effective energy transition to secure a cleaner, more equitable future for generations to come.”

In his closing remarks on Friday, IMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez urged member states to work together and arrive at an accord over the next year.

“Even though you have differences of opinion, you all spoke in support of the work of this organization,” he said. “There are no winners and losers in this session. Let us take this moment to learn from it and come back ready to negotiate and take the next steps needed to meet the goals you all agreed to in the 2023 GHG strategy.”",https://media.zenfs.com/en/sourcing_journal_735/64333df08211b058e4bc777beb3cbcec,N,,2025-10-21 12:20:47.654389

Pinar Langer, Research Fellow at UCL Energy Institute Shipping & Oceans Research Group highlighted.","The meeting failed to complete the next milestone toward the entry into force of the “Net Zero Framework”. In the decision taken at the end of the week, a vote was called for by Saudi Arabia to adjourn the meeting for one year. The vote resulted in 57 countries accepting the motion, forming a majority of those present and voting, and the meeting was subsequently adjourned.

This is catastrophic for confidence, and therefore also for the equitable and ambitious decarbonisation we need. We will now have to double-down on other means to drive shipping GHG reduction and energy transition. Climate science tells us that the challenge of decarbonisation does not go away, it gets harder.

…said Dr. Tristan Smith, Professor of Energy and Transport at UCL Energy Institute Shipping & Oceans Research Group, highlighting that the delay therefore means those with the means must step up and lead more than ever, until this multilateral process can regain its composure.

A vote was also called at the MEPC 83 meeting in April 2025, agreeing in principle to the legal amendment to MARPOL Annex VI. A number of countries changed their positions relative to that vote, providing evidence that well-publicised threats from the United States, including tariffs and reprisals for any country that supported the Framework, and related pressure, were effective at changing positions. On this occasion, that pressure appears to have been effective, the UCL Shipping and Oceans Research Group explains.

The adoption of the Net Zero Framework by the IMO would have marked a crucial step forward for shipping decarbonization. Although adoption has been postponed, the process remains underway, with key technical guidelines now the focus before potential adoption in 2026.

…Dr. Annika Frosch, Research Fellow at UCL Energy Institute Shipping & Oceans Research Group, noted.

The decision on the IMO’s Net Zero Framework does not override or change the foundation of the GHG Reduction Strategy that was adopted at MEPC 80 in 2023. This unanimously adopted strategy commits the organisation to absolute GHG emission reductions of 20-30% in 2030 and 70-80% in 2040, on a pathway to reaching net-zero emissions by/around 2050.

As long as that is the stated strategy, the IMO should in theory make progress toward adopting regulations in line with it.

However the outcome at IMO means further work on regional and national regulation of international shipping has now been vindicated, making current regulations such as those in EU likely to be prolonged. We could now see more regions taking similar action.

This unexpected delay highlights both the complexity and the high stakes of reaching global alignment on shipping’s net-zero transition. The year ahead offers a vital window for constructive engagement and for strengthening the evidence base to ensure that when the framework is finally adopted, it is both equitable and actionable across diverse national contexts.

…Dr. Pinar Langer, Research Fellow at UCL Energy Institute Shipping & Oceans Research Group highlighted.

Even with the outcome to defer the conclusion of the current adoption of the NZF, work on the underpinning guidelines can continue, with next week’s meeting (Intersessional Working Group 20th session) going ahead as planned.

These guidelines will specify important details on definitions, calculations and methods for determining how the policy incentivises and evaluates different technology and fuel options needed for decarbonisation, how the fund will be set up and run, and how its key parameters will be revised on an ongoing basis.",https://safety4sea.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/GV_Terminology-e1754994849744.jpg,N,,2025-10-21 17:17:16.668660

Maybe the US’ bullying over the Net-Zero Framework would have killed the plan outright, if one of the two alternative votes called on Friday had happened instead.

Approval by the wildcard ‘explicit acceptance’ procedure would almost certainly have killed the plan, and possibly the entire IMO along with it.

But I don’t think supporters would have called for a vote on the NZF (as Brazil did) on Friday if they didn’t think they could win it. Would China and Singapore have voted against the same framework they voted to approve six months ago? Delaying a big decision is easier than making one, after all.

On the other hand, those in favour might have preferred a swift death for the NZF, instead of the slow one to which many now think it is condemned.

There will be some winners from the failure of the climate push. Owners of rust-bucket tonnage can run it for longer. Those with big investments in LNG-fuelled ships will probably be relieved at the tax holiday this represents for them.

The Union of Greek Shipowners and Intertanko have welcomed the chance for more negotiating time.

But will that extra time mean better policy? I don’t think so. It will be a long time before the IMO policy machine can come up with a replacement framework. Any replacement that looks like a Big Green Scam Tax will meet the same fate as the NZF, once Potus gets wind of it.

The IMO can’t make substantial changes to the NZF until the MEPC session resumes next year. Any major changes will have to be agreed by consensus or voted through, and the parties then given six months to digest them before coming back to adoption.

That means more regional taxation is on the cards. Each country or region without its own maritime emissions tax may soon find itself at a competitive disadvantage to those that do.

That means shipping loses, the developing world loses, green technology loses and everyone gets more paperwork to do.

With majority of the International Maritime Organization (IMO)’s member states voting to delay the Net Zero Framework (NZF) for global shipping by one year, how would the stakes tilt for shipping? It is understandable that there is a clarion call onto IMO to have a ‘Universal’ approach. One that encompasses the trade flows, volumes across trade lanes, inclusivity for the various ship types, impact on flag vessels from various origins, Small and Medium Ship Owners and the inclusion of possible incentives.

The supposed timelines were for the effect to happen in late 2027 with reporting starting 2028, with phases planned until 2030 to reduce GHG emissions by 25-40% with adoption of cleaner fuels going up by 5-10%. Carbon emissions beyond limits were to be priced and plowed to the IMO Net Zero Fund with the aim to invest this into building smarter, cleaner technologies for fuel infrastructure, ports, and green shipping corridors. However, that has now shifted to the right. Containership operators have been placing aggressive targets for decarbonizing their own shipping operations to early 2040s, even before with the supposed 2050 Net Zero plans. That left the bell on the Breakbulk MPV sector’s neck, driven much more by the Bunkering prices, yet being a fraction of the tonnage as against containers, tankers, and bulkers in the market.

How would these changes affect the MPV market? For now, the double situation of ageing fleets and relatively lower newbuildings is here to stay. It goes without saying the effect of high capital investments & their returns, especially when regulations are vetted fluidly for now. And so, it is understandable for the sector to continue its “wait and watch” mode with pockets of activity seen and strides in the Shortsea sector happening too. However, will the compulsion to go greener, have lesser hunger needs to be seen.

With expected project pickups predicted for 2026, the sector is expecting recovery in the MPV prices post a leaner H2 2025. The Toepfer’s Multipurpose Index (TMI) had a marginal dip for Oct 2025, to USD 12,690, a 16-month low, though it must be noted that the prices have remained buoyant and range-bound despite an overall leaner-demand play globally.

While the United States walked out of April’s deliberations over a draft agreement, Russia and Saudi Arabia joined in its dissent at the time by voting against the measure.
“The United States will be moving to levy these remedies against nations that sponsor this European-led neocolonial export of global climate regulations,” the officials wrote.
A missed opportunity aside, the delay is also a “setback” that will derail innovation, deepen inequities and render more difficult and expensive the transition to clean shipping, said Natacha Stamatiou, global shipping and IMO delegation lead at the nonprofit Environmental Defense Fund.","Member countries of the United Nations shipping agency bowed to U.S. pressure on Friday by deciding to postpone by a year a critical vote over a global measure requiring cargo ships to restrict their greenhouse gas emissions or pay what amounts to a pollution tax.

The London-based International Maritime Organization’s motion to delay the approval of the so-called Net-Zero Framework, which was provisionally greenlit in April with the support of American allies such as Britain, Canada, the European Union and Japan, plus that of the World Shipping Council, narrowly passed by a simple majority of 57 countries, with 49 opposing and the remaining absent or abstaining.

The Intersessional Working Group on the Reduction on Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Ships, which is scheduled to meet this week, will stay the course and work on the guidelines for implementing the NZF. Maritime shipping accounts for roughly 3 percent of human-caused global greenhouse gas emissions.

The move came a day after President Donald Trump expressed his “outrage” over the deal on his Truth Social platform, saying that the United States “would NOT stand for this Global Green New Scam Tax on Shipping, and will not adhere to it in any way, shape or form.”

Writing in a joint statement last week, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said that the United States was mulling possible action against countries that backed the measure, including initiating antitrust probes and sanctions, imposing additional port fees and other penalties on their ships, and perhaps even blocking vessels registered in those countries from U.S. ports.

They said that the agreement would unduly or unfairly burden the United States, harm the interests of the American people and raise global shipping costs by as much as 10 percent. While the United States walked out of April’s deliberations over a draft agreement, Russia and Saudi Arabia joined in its dissent at the time by voting against the measure. All three pressed for the framework’s delayed adoption.

“The United States will be moving to levy these remedies against nations that sponsor this European-led neocolonial export of global climate regulations,” the officials wrote. “We will fight hard to protect our economic interests by imposing costs on countries if they support the NZF. Our fellow IMO members should be on notice.”

In a terse response two days later, the European Commission said that it was in favor of efforts to decarbonize the shipping sector and level the global playing field.

UN spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric told reporters in New York that Secretary-General António Guterres saw Friday’s decision as a “missed opportunity for member states to place the shipping sector on a clear, credible path toward net-zero emissions.”

It was only in September that Trump, a longtime fossil fuel proponent who made “drill, baby, drill” a frequent campaign slogan, told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly that climate change was the “greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world.”

“All of these predictions made by the United Nations and many others, often for bad reasons, were wrong,” he said. “They were made by stupid people that have cost their countries fortunes and given those same countries no chance for success. If you don’t get away from this green scam, your country is going to fail.”

Earlier this month, the White House nixed $7.6 billion in grants that underpinned hundreds of clean energy projects in more than a dozen states—all of which voted for the Democratic opponent, Kamala Harris, in last year’s presidential election.

“President Trump promised to protect taxpayer dollars and expand America’s supply of affordable, reliable, and secure energy,” Wright had said. “Today’s cancellations deliver on that commitment.”

The NZF would require cargo ships weighing 5,000 gross tonnage or more to pay a fee if their carbon emissions exceed a certain mandatory limit, thereby incentivizing cleaner fuels and technologies. Collected revenue would be used to reward low-emissions ships, mitigate negative impacts on vulnerable member states and support innovation and research in developing countries. If the measure had gone through, it would have marked the first time a legally binding global carbon price was levied on any sector.

A missed opportunity aside, the delay is also a “setback” that will derail innovation, deepen inequities and render more difficult and expensive the transition to clean shipping, said Natacha Stamatiou, global shipping and IMO delegation lead at the nonprofit Environmental Defense Fund.

“We know progress is possible when governments act together; now they have the opportunity to prove it,” she said in a statement. “We cannot afford to wait any longer. It is vital that member states return to the negotiating table and deliver a measure that reflects wise ambition—one that delivers a just and effective energy transition to secure a cleaner, more equitable future for generations to come.”

In his closing remarks on Friday, IMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez urged member states to work together and arrive at an accord over the next year.

“Even though you have differences of opinion, you all spoke in support of the work of this organization,” he said. “There are no winners and losers in this session. Let us take this moment to learn from it and come back ready to negotiate and take the next steps needed to meet the goals you all agreed to in the 2023 GHG strategy.”

The milestones include the expansion of shore power infrastructure to meet 100% electrification serving container vessels, deploying minimized lifecycle carbon-capable ships as well as ramping up alternative fuel bunkering operations, officials from the Port of Los Angeles have unveiled.

The data was revealed in a new report that showcased the progress made by the partnership since the launch of the initiative, particularly over the past year, and outlined the steps planned to accomplish the goals ahead, such as demonstrating the feasibility of deploying zero lifecycle carbon emission boxships by 2030.

The partners gathered in March this year in Long Beach for a second in-person meeting, where they reiterated their ambitions for the corridor’s goals and detailed the next actions that needed to be taken to tackle challenges. At the time, a fourth working group that would focus on metrics and evaluation was reportedly launched.

Per the Port of Los Angeles, future activities for the ports encompass continuing the expansion of shore power, promoting the use of electric, photovoltaic and wind energy within the Port of Shanghai, and boosting refueling capacity for clean fuels like green methanol and liquefied natural gas (LNG), among others, to support the corridor’s development.

Regarding the 2025 milestones to date, according to the report, the Port of Shanghai has marked a number of milestones:

its container terminals have all been equipped with shore power, offering a 50% emission reduction for berthed vessels and subsidizing the use of this solution for vessels using the port;

the port has retained its spot as the third largest facility for the refueling of LNG (by annual volume) with a steady capacity for green methanol bunkering, having supplied over 47,000 tons of this sustainable fuel this year (including the ‘first’ domestic bunkering of Chinese-produced green methanol);

biofuel bunkering for international ships was initiated at the Yangshan Deepwater Port Area;

from January to August, LNG refueling volume reached 500,000 cubic meters, with the service expanded from Yangshan to the Waigaoqiao Port Area.

As informed, for the Port of Los Angeles and Long Beach, the following activities have been done:

container terminals at both ports have been fitted with 100% shore power;

ports’ representatives have spoken with regulatory agencies and industry players about bunkering guidelines, safety protocols, training requirements and operating procedures;

LA and LB have commissioned a “Clean Fuels Study” to explore potential fuel and bunkering service providers to meet the demands of the green shipping corridor’s clean marine fueling goals.

The report has highlighted that, in addition to this, the initiative’s Energy Supply Working Group has also reviewed fuel standards for 2026 adoption (comprising requirements for the fuels’ GHG intensity), wrapped up a study on fuel demand and supply for the corridor and tracked developments at the European Union (EU), the International Maritime Organization (IMO) as well as other organizations and regions on both energy source standards and regulations.",https://cdn.offshorewind.biz/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/09/26132015/Screenshot_16.jpg,N,,2025-10-21 15:00:58.826649

At SMM 2026, the global maritime flagship fair taking place next September, companies will showcase technologies driving the energy transformation of the global shipping sector.

It came as a blow: The member states of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) failed to achieve consensus on a global climate protection policy last week. The decision was postponed to next year. In an extraordinary session, the IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) discussed effective measures to implement the IMO climate goals, such as a global alternative fuel standard and an emission penalty for ships exceeding set limits.

But those dealing with the practical implications of these plans remain sceptical about the IMO’s climate ambition. This is one of the conclusions drawn by the SMM Maritime Industry Report 2025 (MIR) which summarises the responses of roughly 1,500 industry leaders surveyed by Hamburg Messe und Congress (HMC).

Roughly half of shipowners and suppliers (51 per cent) doubt that the net-zero goal can be achieved by 2050. 46 per cent of shipyards share this assessment. Just barely one third of respondents (29 per cent of shipowners, and 26 per cent of yards) are more optimistic. Market insiders such as yard manager and Chairman of the SMM Advisory Committee Dr. Klaus Borgschulte are not surprised: “After all we are talking about roughly 90,000 ships world-wide – a gigantic undertaking that can hardly be accomplished within the given time frame.”

Investing in the future

Despite these doubts, sustainability continues to range at the top of the industry’s agenda: 78 per cent of responding suppliers expect the issue to become even more prominent in the coming years. Nine out of ten companies are in the process of implementing specific measures, a marked increase from the previous survey (+ 8 per cent).

The IMO’s Net-Zero Framework is already reshaping investment decisions, operational strategies, and fuel choices across the maritime value chain, confirms Knut Ørbeck-Nilssen, CEO of DNV Maritime. According to the classification society’s Maritime Forecast to 2050, the number of climate-friendly ships is growing steadily. The supply of the required alternative fuels remains limited, however. Over the next ten years, the MIR survey participants expect the demand for LNG, biofuels, methanol and other hydrogen-based fuels to soar. In addition, hybrid propulsion solutions could play a key role, as well.

Efficiency is the new capital

“In the end, cost and availability will be the decisive factors,” points out Richard von Berlepsch, long-standing fleet director at the shipping company Hapag-Lloyd. There can be no doubt that alternative fuels will be more expensive than conventional ones, making efficient ship operations a crucial success factor for both newbuilds and vessels in service.

As a consequence, the industry puts the focus on retrofitting existing ships, implementing measures such as propeller and energy system upgrades, or installing exhaust gas treatment systems: According to the MIR survey, 78 per cent of shipowners are planning to invest in appropriate technologies, especially propulsion systems (66 per cent) and digital solutions (58 per cent). “Shipowners are willing to spend money,” says von Berlepsch.

Success through collaboration

“Generally there is confidence and a strong willingness to invest,” says Hauke Schlegel, CEO at VDMA Marine Equipment and Systems. “Our industry has the right technologies to lead the shipping sector to a climate-friendly future.” Schlegel believes close collaboration between the different stakeholders is key to taking the industry up to the next level.

Claus-Ulrich Selbach, Vice President Exhibitions Maritime & Energy at Hamburg Messe und Congress, emphasises: “Everyone involved understands there won’t be that one single technology solution to achieve the IMO’s zero-emission goal by 2050 – neither in terms of propulsion technology nor when it comes to energy sources. There will be a combination of many technologies enabling the shipping sector to achieve net zero, combined with operational efficiency enhancements including digitalisation and Artificial Intelligence. At SMM, decision-makers will find the full spectrum of technologies.""

SMM attendees will be eagerly anticipating the discussions at the subject matter-specific conferences offered at the fair. “The leading international maritime trade fair is the perfect platform to shape the future of the maritime economy,” says SMM Director Christoph Lücke. “This is where representatives of the political, scientific and business worlds meet to breathe life into the transformation.” Their common goal coincides with the theme of SMM 2026: “Driving The Maritime Transition”.",https://www.ajot.com/images/uploads/article/_large/doubts-about-IMO-targets.png,N,,2025-10-21 13:16:48.715445

However, US President Donald Trump had called the plan a “green scam” and representatives of his administration had threatened countries with tariffs if they voted in favour of it, the BBC wrote.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio was quoted as saying the outcome a “huge win” for Trump.

IMO secretary general Arsenio Dominguez had issued a “plea” that there should be no repetition of the way the meeting had been approached.

On the day of the BBC report – when countries should have been voting to approve the deal – Saudi Arabia tabled a motion to adjourn the talks for a year, which was narrowly approved.

The chairman had said this would mean the agreement would not be approved, as key timelines for the treaty would have had to be revised, the BBC wrote.

Ralph Regenvanu, minister for Climate Change for the Republic of Vanuatu, said Saudi Arabia’s motion was quoted as saying “unacceptable given the urgency we face in light of accelerating climate change”.

“We came to London in reluctant support of the IMO’s Net-Zero Framework. While it lacks the ambition that climate science demands, it does mark a significant step,” he said.

The deal had generally been supported by the shipping industry as it offered consistent global standards, the report said.

Speaking after the talks ended, Thomas Kazakos, secretary-general of the industry body the International Chamber of Shipping, was quoted as saying: “We are disappointed that member states have not been able to agree a way forward at this meeting. Industry needs clarity to be able to make the investments.”

While most European Union (EU) nations and the UK had voted to continue the talks, some countries including Greece had gone against the EU bloc and voted to abstain, the BBC wrote.

Some key countries including China that had initially voted to support the deal in April agreed to delay proceedings.

Island states Bahamas also changed their position and Antigua and Barbuda, who agreed in April, abstained. A delegate from the island states group told the BBC that these nations particularly relied on the USA for trade and had been leaned on heavily by the Trump administration to change their position.

First agreed in April after ten years of negotiations, the deal was considered historic as it meant shipping was set to become the first industry in the world with internationally mandated targets to reduce emissions.

The agreement would have meant that from 2028 ship owners would have had to use increasingly cleaner fuels or face fines, the report said.

Shipping currently makes up 3% of global emissions, with levels increasing in line with global trade rises – 90% of goods are currently transported via the sea.

Unlike other sectors shipping has been unable to reduce its emissions, in part due to the lack of cost incentive, according to the report.

Without intervention, the IMO has previously estimated that by 2050 maritime emissions could increase by between 10% and 150%.

The USA had been increasingly vocal about its objections to the plan since April over concerns the move could raise prices for consumers, the BBC wrote.

Their ancestors have lived on this string of Pacific islands for thousands of years. But as sea level rises, storms more easily flood communities and farmland with saltwater. Warming ocean water has triggered mass coral-bleaching events, harming habitats that are important for both tourism and fish that the islands’ economy relies on.

If the world fails to rein in the greenhouse gas emissions driving climate change, studies suggest low-lying islands like these could be uninhabitable within decades.

Climate change isn’t just a problem for islands. Countries worldwide are experiencing intensifying storms, dangerous heat waves and rising seas as global temperatures rise.

Yet, after 30 years of international climate talks, 10 years of a global treaty promising to keep temperatures in check, and trillions of dollars in damage, the world is still not on track to stop rising global temperatures. Greenhouse gas emissions were at record highs in 2024, and it was Earth’s hottest year on record.

I study the dynamics of global environmental politics, including the United Nations climate negotiations. And I and my lab have been tracking countries’ latest climate pledges – known as nationally determined contributions, or NDCs – to see which countries have stepped up their efforts, which have slid back and who has ideas that can deliver a safer world for everyone.

While the Trump administration has been pressuring countries to back away from their climate commitments – and succeeded in delaying an International Maritime Organization vote on a global plan to tax greenhouse gas emissions from shipping after threatening other counties with sanctions, visa restrictions and port fees if they supported it – many countries are still pressing ahead.

Trump agitates, but many countries are steadfast

U.S. President Donald Trump, whose administration came into office vowing to eliminate climate regulations and boost the fossil fuel industry, derided concerns about climate change in his Sept. 23, 2025, speech to the U.N. General Assembly. He called climate change the “greatest con job ever perpetuated” and ridiculed green energy and climate science.

Trump’s language no longer surprises world leaders, though. More than 100 other countries announced new climate commitments during a high-level summit a few days later.

China, currently the world’s largest greenhouse gas emitter, was lauded for hitting its green energy targets five years early. Its rapid expansion of low-cost renewable energy and electric vehicle manufacturing has reduced pollution in Chinese cities while also boosting its economy and expanding the government’s influence around the world.

Chinese President Xi Jinping announced the country’s first absolute emissions reduction goal at the summit, committing to cut its net greenhouse gas emissions by 7% to 10% from peak levels by 2035. China also committed to nearly triple its solar and wind power capacity and expand reforestation efforts.

While advocates and other governments had hoped for a stronger announcement from China, the new goals mark an important shift from the country’s earlier carbon intensity targets, which aimed to decrease the amount of greenhouse gas emissions per unit of economic output but still allowed emissions to grow over time.

The European Union has yet to submit its new commitments, but the group of 27 European countries delivered a letter of intent, saying it would commit to a 66% to 72% collective decrease in net greenhouse gas emissions by 2035 compared with 1990 levels. Europe has seen a swift rise in renewable energy, up sharply since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine put the continent’s natural gas supplies in jeopardy.

The EU has also made waves by extending its carbon pricing rules beyond its borders.

The EU’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, scheduled to begin in January 2026, will be the first system to charge for the climate impact of imported goods coming into Europe from countries that don’t have carbon prices similar to the EU’s. The measure, meant to even the playing field for EU industries, sets a global precedent for linking carbon emissions to trade.

However, the EU’s climate plans are also facing some headwinds. Its parliament is moving toward softening new corporate sustainability requirements after pressure from companies. And it may face calls from some member countries to delay a new carbon market meant to cut emissions from road transportation and buildings, Politico reported.

The EU has pledged to mobilize up to 300 billion Euros (about US$350 billion) to support the global clean energy transition in developing countries.

The United Kingdom, Japan and Australia submitted their most ambitious targets to date. All three put them on track to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, meaning any greenhouse gases they emit will be offset by projects that avoid carbon emissions or remove carbon from the atmosphere.

In Australia, Queensland’s recent announcement that it would extend existing coal power plant use to the 2030s and 2040s may slow national progress. But Queensland also supports scaling up renewable energy and is still aiming for net-zero emissions by 2050.

Norway committed to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by at least 70% by 2035 compared with 1990 levels, which would align with the Paris Agreement goal to keep global emissions below 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit). However, it plans to remain a major oil and gas exporter.

Notably, many developing countries also stepped up their commitments.

Brazil pledged a net emissions reduction of 59% to 67% by 2035 and is maintaining its 2050 net-zero target. The government also drew criticism for approving plans for oil exploration near the mouth of the Amazon River.

Free riding and taking cover behind the US

However, while some new climate commitments signal important momentum in the fight against climate change, the tug-of-war between global ambition to slow climate change and strategic self-interests was palpable at the New York summit. The responses to Trump’s remarks revealed both veiled critiques and deceleration of climate action by some governments.

China criticized backsliding by some countries, without naming names.

Brazil used the summit to call out countries that were late in submitting their updated climate commitments. Only about a third had submitted their updated pledges at that point.

While it is difficult to parse out individual country motivations – economic stress, wars and political influence can all play a role – many scholars worry that U.S. backsliding will lead other countries to reduce their climate commitments, and some recent pledges appear to back this up.

Many petroleum-producing countries missed the U.N. pledge deadline. Qatar, which recently gifted the U.S. a jet plane for Trump’s use and has an economy largely bolstered by the oil and gas industry, has not updated its pledge since 2021. The six-member Gulf Cooperation Council’s average emissions reduction target is even lower than Qatar’s, at around 21.6% by 2030.

Similarly, Argentina, among the world’s top holders of shale oil and gas reserves, has not released its updated commitments. Progress on its previous commitment has been undermined by political shifts since President Javier Milei’s election in 2023.

Milei initially vowed to abandon the 2030 agenda entirely and withdraw from the Paris Agreement, though his administration later backtracked. His dismissal of climate change as a “socialist lie” has aligned Argentina closely with Trump, culminating in a recently planned US$20 billion aid package from the U.S. to Argentina and raising questions about whether Argentina’s climate stance reflects genuine policy or geopolitical strategy.

Also noticeably absent are commitments from India, Mexico, South Africa and Saudi Arabia. Angola weakened its climate pledge, citing lack of international funding.

A new way to make climate commitments?

While many countries are promising progress to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the commitments formally submitted as of Oct. 20 were still far below the level needed to keep global temperatures from rising by 2 C (3.6 F), let alone 1.5 C.

To help boost national efforts and accountability, Brazil has proposed a new approach it calls a globally determined contribution. Unlike the 1997 Kyoto Protocol framework, which set fixed, country-specific emission reduction targets based on historical baselines, or the 2015 Paris Agreement’s pledge-as-you-can system, it would establish global targets aligned with the Paris Agreement’s temperature goals.

So, a globally determined contribution might state, for example, that the world will triple its renewable energy production and reverse deforestation by 2030. A target like that gives countries a clearer path of action. The new format would also allow city and state actions to be counted separately, increasing incentives for them to act.

As the host of the COP30 climate talks Nov. 10-21, 2025, Brazil is uniquely positioned to champion this concept. In the absence of U.S. leadership, the proposal could offer a rare opportunity for countries to collectively strengthen commitments and reshape treaty language in a way never seen before – leaving open the possibility for progress.

Threat of US sanctions stall adoption of IMO's global pricing system to curb greenhouse gases

Member states of the United Nations' International Maritime Organization (IMO) voted to delay the adoption of the Net Zero Framework (NZF) after threats by the Trump administration to impose sanctions on countries that vote in support of the proposed global carbon pricing mechanism. The NZF standards, which were set to be formally adopted in this week's meeting and enter into force in 2027, would have become mandatory for large ocean-going ships over 5,000 gross tonnage, which emit 85% of the total CO2 emissions from international shipping.

The decision and debate around postponing the vote reflected deep divisions, with 57 countries voting in favor of a delay, 49 against a delay and 21 abstaining. IMO Secretary General Arsenio Dominguez stated that the year delay will provide time to adopt amendments and build the needed consensus to support the NZF. Postponement was backed by oil-producing nations, China, and major flag states like Liberia and Panama, while most EU countries, Norway, and the UK opposed the move. The threat of US sanctions, risking increased tariffs, penalties and visa restrictions against supporting countries, was a tipping point, empowering the bloc led by Saudi Arabia and the US in opposition to the NZF. Some countries that previously supported or abstained in the preliminary April vote took new positions as the conference convened this week, throwing what had been expected to be a proforma session into disarray. A consensus emerged that a delay was preferable to a failure to approve implementation, as there would be no clear path forward on how to reintroduce or amend the NZF.

In the April meeting of the UN shipping body, the measure had passed with the support of 63 member states and 16 countries against, and 24 countries abstained. Those countries that support the framework argue that a global fuel standard is needed in order to ensure a managed transition, ensuring availability of fuel, uptake and transfer of zero-emission fuels and technology, seafarer training and capacity building. Developing states in particular would face steep challenges on meeting new standards and would need the industry to share risks.

Saudi Arabia, which led the opposing bloc in April, argued that taxing shipping emissions would raise food and commodity costs, with developing countries hardest hit. Riyadh also argued that IMO's proposed powers to raise funds, spend money, and impose sanctions are beyond its legal authority under the MARPOL convention. In the October session, Washington and Riyadh called for the IMO to abandon its long-standing tacit acceptance process, in which new rules automatically take effect 10 months after adoption unless a critical mass of states object, in favor of explicit acceptance requiring two-thirds of governments to individually ratify the changes. Most delegations, led by Denmark, Canada, Australia, the EU and Kenya, rejected the proposal outright, warning that it would paralyze future IMO rule-making.

The outlook for future adoption of a revised NZF is mixed. The Trump administration, which considers the framework an unfair carbon tax on American businesses, is unlikely to agree to any proposal with a mandatory compliance clause or penalties. Furthermore, President Trump has demonstrated that he is willing to sanction international bodies, individuals and countries adopting policies adverse to his administration's priorities. Supporters of the NZF are hoping that the political risk environment will be altered over the next year, generating support for energy transition and global carbon reduction measures.

US Developments

Congress Renews Call for Russia Sanctions as Trump Plans Summit with Putin

Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) said last week that Members of Congress are ""talking about a time and date"" for a vote on the Sanctioning Russia Act of 2025 (S. 1241) and that, in his opinion, ""it's time to move"" on it. Multiple Senators including Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), the Ranking Member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL), the Senate Democratic Whip, voiced their support for passing the legislation, which already has strong bipartisan support across both Chambers.

Thune said that he expects the bill to be brought up in the next 30 days. Depending on when the legislation is brought forward, Congress may be voting on the Act at the same time as President Trump's planned meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Budapest, Hungary. After a call with Putin on October 16, Trump said negotiations to end the war in Ukraine will happen after a delegation led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio meets with their Russian counterparts this week.

If the bill passes before the meeting with Putin, Trump may use it as part of his efforts to end Russian energy purchases across Europe, India, and other countries as leverage in the negotiations. However, the White House has argued in the past that the Act would restrict Trump's flexibility in his negotiations with Russia. In particular, the administration has said that the Act would limit the ability of the President to offer Russia relief from sanctions in exchange for a favorable end to the war. Although Trump has also voiced support for imposing sanctions on Russia in the past, it is unclear whether he would sign the Act if it were to pass Congress during his administration's negotiations with Russia.

OFAC Targets Affiliates of Haitian Gang

On October 17, OFAC sanctioned two individuals for their support of or affiliation with Viv Ansanm, a coalition of gangs that was designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) and Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) on May 2, 2025, for contributing to destabilizing activities in Haiti, including coordinated attacks on critical infrastructure. One of the designated individuals, Dimitri Herard, is a former Haitian police officer who OFAC alleges was connected to, and later imprisoned for, the assassination of former President Jovenel Moïse in 2021. OFAC alleges that the other designated individual, Kempes Sanon, is the leader of the Bel Air gang, a constituent gang in the Viv Ansanm alliance, that has been involved in indiscriminate civilian killings and extortion, among other crimes.

UK Developments

UK to Move to a Single Sanctions List from January 2026

The UK Government has announced that from January 28, 2026, the UK Sanctions List will become the single authoritative source for all UK sanctions designations. Currently, UK designations are detailed in two lists, the UK Sanctions List, published by the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) and the Consolidated List of Asset Freeze Targets, published for HM Treasury by the Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI). The OFSI Consolidated List of Asset Freeze Targets will close at 09:00 GMT on January 28, 2026. This change, jointly announced by the FCDO, HM Treasury and OFSI, responds to industry feedback that a single list will simplify compliance and remove duplication when screening UK designated persons. Businesses that currently rely on both lists are advised to switch to the UK Sanctions List as their primary data source well in advance of the transition and review their internal systems accordingly. Updated UK Government guidance has been published to support compliance preparations.

OTSI Uses Case Study to Highlight Best Practice in Detecting Trade Sanctions Breaches

The Office of Trade Sanctions Implementation (""OTSI"") has published a detailed case study to illustrate how robust due diligence can prevent breaches of UK trade sanctions. The case study concerns a UK branch of a multinational bank that identified several suspicious payments linked to the movement of Russian-origin goods to a third country. These goods were subject to prohibitions under the Russia (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019, which make it an offence for a UK person to facilitate trade involving restricted goods from Russia.

In this case, payments for the prohibited goods were routed through the bank's UK branch, which acted as an intermediary in the transaction. The branch's internal account screening systems flagged the activity, triggering enhanced due diligence checks. Following its investigation, the bank correctly declined to process the payments and voluntarily reported the matter to OTSI using its online reporting tool. OTSI reviewed the information provided, including invoices and contractual documents, and confirmed that no breach had occurred, as the payments were stopped before completion.

OTSI's key takeaways for industry from this case study include understanding how UK trade prohibitions apply to financial services, performing enhanced due diligence on high-risk clients and jurisdictions, maintaining robust screening systems capable of halting suspect transactions, and using OTSI's reporting tool to disclose potential breaches. Businesses are encouraged to adopt a risk-based approach to sanctions compliance and to view trade sanctions awareness as an essential element of responsible corporate governance.

OFSI Publishes Annual Sanctions Review

OFSI has published its Annual Sanctions Review for 2024-2025, highlighting continued progress in enforcement and industry engagement. The report shows that assets frozen under UK sanctions rose from £24.4 billion to £37 billion, with £28.7 billion linked to Russia-related measures since 2022. OFSI recorded 394 suspected breach cases and issued 57 enforcement actions, including penalties against Integral Concierge Services Limited and Herbert Smith Freehills. The number of designations on the UK list reached 4,733, with 2,113 related to Russia. The review underscores OFSI's focus on strengthening compliance, modernising its licensing systems, and maintaining enforcement as a central feature of the UK's economic deterrence strategy.

UK Government Targets Russian Oil Majors and Defence Sector in Latest Round of Russia Sanctions

The UK Government has designated 34 entities, five individuals, and specified 51 ships under the Russia (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019, following the unilateral decision by the UK Government to further target Russian oil revenues and military supply chains. Notably, the UK government has imposed Russia's two largest oil producers, Rosneft and Lukoil. According to a UK Government press release, these sanctions target two of the world's biggest energy companies and their global enablers, including four oil terminals in China, 44 tankers in the ""shadow fleet"" transporting Russian oil, and Indian incorporated company, Nayara Energy Limited. The measures also impose sanctions on businesses that supply electronics critical for Russian drones and missiles used on the battlefield in Ukraine, including businesses operating in China, Singapore, Thailand, and Turkey. Businesses should update screening systems immediately to reflect the expanded list, paying particular attention to counterparties in the energy and electronics sectors, where overlap with newly listed entities is most likely.

While precise details remain to be announced, the UK government also has signalled its intention to ban imports of oil products refined in third countries from Russian-origin crude oil, which would represent a significant expansion of existing UK sanctions on Russian oil and oil products.

The UK Government has also issued two new general licences to allow the wind-down of existing transactions in response to the imposition of the latest wave of sanctions on Russia affecting the energy industry (the ""GLs""). The GLs cover the wind-down of existing operations with Russian oil majors (GL INT/2025/7539056), and with any of the newly sanctioned energy companies with ties to the Russian energy industry (GL INT/2025/7538856). These GLs took effect from October 15, 2025, and expire at 23.59 on November 28, 2025, and November 13, 2025, respectively. Additionally, on October 15, 2025, existing General Licences INT/2025/5886860 and INT/2025/5635700 were amended to include PJSC Lukoil Oil Company, PJSC Rosneft Oil Company, and their subsidiaries within their scope following their UK designations.

This latest action marks one of the most significant expansions of the UK's Russia sanctions to date, underscoring the UK Government's continued focus on disrupting Russia's oil revenues. Companies operating in the global energy supply chain should assess both direct and indirect links to newly sanctioned entities, ensure compliance procedures are up to date, and prepare for increased scrutiny of Russian oil-related transactions.

UK Government Targets Major Online Fraud Network in Latest Round of Global Human Rights Sanctions

The UK Government has acted in coordination with the United States to designate six individuals and six entities involved in the operation of illegal scam centres that defraud victims across the world out of substantial sums of money and torture their trafficked workers. The designations have been made under the Global Human Rights sanctions regime. According to a UK Government press release, the leader of the network, Chen Zhi, and his web of enablers have incorporated their businesses in the British Virgin Islands and invested in the London property market to defraud victims on an industrial scale, including in the UK. The designated persons are now subject to a UK asset freeze, and, in the case of individuals, a UK travel ban.

UK Extends Russia Sectoral Software General Trade Licence to April 2026

The Export Control Joint Unit (ECJU) has extended the validity of the General Trade Licence (Russia Sanctions – Sectoral Software and Technology), which authorises certain transfers of business software and technology to Russia that would otherwise be prohibited under Chapter 4N of the Russia (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019. The new licence, which replaces the previous version due to expire on October 20, 2025, will now remain in effect until April 17, 2026, and contains identical provisions to the earlier iteration of the licence.

To qualify, transfers must be made to multinational clients headquartered outside Russia, relate to contracts agreed before April 23, 2025, and be for non-predominant use by Russian subsidiaries. Businesses using the licence must comply with registration and record-keeping requirements. The extension provides limited operational continuity for multinational firms with pre-existing contractual obligations involving Russian affiliates, while ensuring adherence to UK sanctions restrictions on technology and software transfers.

EU Developments

The European Commission recently published updated FAQs clarifying restrictive measures under Council Regulation 833/2014, focusing on the import ban on refined petroleum products derived from Russian crude oil and the export-related restrictions on dual-use goods and advanced technologies.

As part of the 18th sanctions package against Russia, the EU introduced a ban on the purchase, import, or transfer of refined petroleum products produced from Russian crude oil into the EU. As a result, starting January 21, 2026, importers must provide evidence at the time of importation demonstrating the origin of the crude oil used in the production of refined petroleum products. The updated FAQs outline acceptable forms of evidence for these purposes, as well as the need for operators to exercise enhanced due diligence for imports from countries with high Russian crude intake such as Türkiye, India, and China. The FAQs also list third countries considered net exporters of crude oil in 2024, which benefit from a presumption that their petroleum products are domestically sourced unless rebutted by credible indications of Russian crude use.

In parallel, the Commission updated its FAQs on export restrictions for dual-use and advanced technology items against Russia to support competent authorities and stakeholders in implementing the restrictions under Council Regulation 833/2014. The FAQs clarify the scope of prohibited sensitive items and the specific situations in which derogations may apply. They also provide guidance to help businesses understand how the export restrictions operate in practice, along with a section outlining cooperation with partner countries that have aligned their export control measures with the EU sanctions framework.

Asia-Pacific Developments

China Sanctions US Subsidiaries of South Korean Shipbuilder Hanwha Ocean

In response to the United States' implementation of final measures under its Section 301 investigation targeting China's maritime, logistics, and shipbuilding sectors, China's Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) announced, on October 14, 2025, counter sanctions against five US subsidiaries of South Korean shipbuilder Hanwha Ocean as approved by China's National Anti Foreign Sanctions Coordination Mechanism. MOFCOM stated that these subsidiaries, Hanwha Shipping LLC, Hanwha Philly Shipyard Inc., Hanwha Ocean USA International LLC, Hanwha Shipping Holdings LLC, and HS USA Holdings Corp., had assisted and supported the US government's investigation and related actions, thereby harming China's sovereignty and security.

All organizations and individuals in China are prohibited from engaging in transactions, cooperation, or other activities with these entities, pursuant to China's Anti Foreign Sanctions Law and its implementing provisions. On October 17, a spokesperson for the US State Department denounced China's sanctions, describing it as an ""irresponsible attempt"" to disrupt private business operations and undermine South Korea–US efforts to revitalize America's shipbuilding and manufacturing sectors.

Australian Authorities Charge Man Over Alleged Sanctions-Breaching Remittances

On October 15, 2025, the Australian Federal Police, in coordination with the Australian Sanctions Office and Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC), announced charges against a 34-year-old Western Sydney man for allegedly remitting approximately AUD 650,000 to Iranian banks subject to Australian sanctions. The individual, a director of a remittance company, is accused of processing 543 transactions over a 12-month period, facing a maximum penalty of 10 years' imprisonment and substantial fines. Following the investigation, AUSTRAC also suspended the company's remittance registration for one year. The Australian Sanctions Office warned members of the financial industry about the serious consequences of contravening national sanctions laws.

New Zealand Reimposes UN Sanctions on Iran Over Nuclear Non-Compliance

New Zealand announced the reimposition of United Nations-mandated sanctions on Iran, citing Tehran's failure to comply with its nuclear obligations under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). The United Nations Sanctions (Iran) Regulations 2025, effective October 18, introduce measures including asset freezes and travel bans on designated individuals, import and export restrictions on nuclear and military goods, and a requirement for citizens to exercise vigilance in dealings with Iran. The government also confirmed a compulsory registration scheme for businesses engaging with Iran, set to commence on February 1, 2026. Foreign Minister Winston Peters emphasized that these steps reflect New Zealand's commitment to global non-proliferation efforts and urged Iran to resume full cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).

He added Greece had raised concerns regarding the NZF, proposing improvements to ensure it meets the real needs of shipping and reflects the realities of the global fuel market.
At that time, Ms Travlos highlighted concerns over the feasibility of the targets, emphasising that transitional fuels such as LNG were not adequately recognised.
“It is very difficult to accept adding fuel to inflation and passing it on to the consumer,” said one experienced Greek shipping executive.
The Cyprus Union of Shipowners later joined these concerns, underscoring the widespread apprehension over the current form of the NZF.","IMO decided to delay discussions on the NZF for one year, with Greece and Cyprus abstaining in a vote to adjourn October’s extraordinary session of the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) until 2026, even while other EU nations voted to push ahead with negotiations.

“Shipping needs international rules that are accepted by all, not punitive mechanisms,” said Greek Minister of Maritime Affairs and Insular Policy, Vasilis Kikilias. He added Greece had raised concerns regarding the NZF, proposing improvements to ensure it meets the real needs of shipping and reflects the realities of the global fuel market.

Last week’s negotiations, Mr Kikilias noted, highlighted weaknesses in the framework, including implementation timelines, the unfair treatment of LNG fuel, and unreasonably high penalties for shipping. “If adopted, they could potentially cause severe disruptions to global trade and increases in product prices,” he warned.

The minister concluded that over the next year, “significant negotiations are required, incorporating market perspectives with realism and fairness.”

Union of Greek Shipowners (UGS) president Melina Travlos echoed this view, noting the delay presents a new opportunity to shape a framework that will guide global shipping safely and realistically through the green transition.

She added the lack of consensus “highlighted deep rifts over the proposed Net-Zero Framework regulation, where the positions advanced by the shipping industry were not sufficiently taken into account.”

Serious objections from Greek owners

Several notable figures in Greek shipping had already voiced objections to the NZF following its approval at the MEPC 83 session in April 2025. At that time, Ms Travlos highlighted concerns over the feasibility of the targets, emphasising that transitional fuels such as LNG were not adequately recognised.

Last month, leading Greek shipping owners – including Maria Angelicoussis, George Procopiou, Evangelos Marinakis, George Economou, Peter Livanos and Dimitris Procopiou – co-signed a statement with other international shipowners, expressing “grave concerns” about the NZF.

The group stated that, as currently drafted, the regulation is not fit for purpose and would prevent the industry from fulfilling the emissions-reduction commitments it made in 2023.

According to their estimates, the NZF would raise US$20–30Bn annually by 2030, and could accumulate to more than US$300Bn by 2035 if the global fleet lags behind targets by as little as 10%.

“It is very difficult to accept adding fuel to inflation and passing it on to the consumer,” said one experienced Greek shipping executive.

But Greece has suddenly threatened to block approval because the text, obtained earlier by Euractiv, “welcomes” the international shipping net-zero framework deal struck in April and which Athens refused to sign.

Three diplomats confirmed the blockage to Euractiv, with one diplomat saying that Athens is holding the deal “hostage”.

In Greece, where the shipping industry is a major influence, fighting against the deal has become important at the highest level and is in the hands of Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis.

The Net Zero framework deal was approved last April but not adopted by members of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) following a US intervention.

The line referring to the deal in the EU’s COP30 position paper was “irrelevant,” a source in Athens told Euractiv. The Net Zero Framework deal was frozen last week, and the text should therefore be “re-visited”.

A compromise on the text had yet to be found – any proposal to alter it would need to be signed off by Athens, one senior EU diplomat said.

Following pressure from the Americans, members of the IMO had failed to approve a deal pushing for an ambitious framework favouring green hydrogen-derived fuels (such as green ammonia and methanol) over LNG.

The EU had voted against the postponement of the deal, pitting Brussels against Washington. Greece and Cyprus, however, abstained during the vote.

“Rejecting biofuels in the Net-Zero Framework means protecting the world’s remaining tropical forests – critical carbon sinks and biodiversity hotspots.” said Anggi Putra Prayoga, Forest Campaigner at Forest Watch Indonesia.
To avoid these impacts, the IMO should make sure high-ILUC fuels are excluded in the Framework.
“We urge all IMO member governments to take a strong, united stance against the inclusion of biofuels in the Net-Zero Framework” said Pax Butchart, Biofuel Campaigner at Biofuelwatch.
This translates to 9% of overall maritime emissions, equivalent to 25 million metric tonnes (mt) of oil consumption by 2030.","International nature conservation organisations Biofuelwatch, Forest Watch Indonesia and Global Forest Coalition on Monday (20 October) urged the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) to exclude harmful biofuels from compliance with the Net-Zero Framework.

Last week, during the Extraordinary Session of the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC ES.2) in London, countries decided to postpone the decision on the adoption of the Framework to 2026.

But important discussions will continue on 20 to 24 October on key details on clean energy incentives in the Framework, and the organisations stressed the importance of preventing biofuels from being included as a supposed “green” alternative to fossil fuels.

Decades of evidence show that indirect land use change (ILUC) emissions from crop-based biofuels – such as soy and oil palm – wipe out their claimed climate benefits, driving forest loss, food insecurity, and land and water grabbing as agriculture is displaced onto marginal or uncultivated land. Soy and oil palm-based biofuels can generate emissions even higher than fossil fuels.

“Biofuels are not a sustainable solution under any circumstances. In Latin America, the push for soy-based biofuels has accelerated deforestation and driven communities off their lands. If the IMO creates new demand for biofuels, it will unleash more emissions, more inequality, and more land grabbing” said Jana Uemura, Climate Campaigner at the Global Forest Coalition.

“Rejecting biofuels in the Net-Zero Framework means protecting the world’s remaining tropical forests – critical carbon sinks and biodiversity hotspots.” said Anggi Putra Prayoga, Forest Campaigner at Forest Watch Indonesia.

“The climate crisis is already real. It is crucial to take a firm stance on adopting truly zero-emission energy sources, rather than biofuels that generate new emissions through deforestation.”

“The loss of forests not only worsens emissions but also endangers the lives and rights of Indigenous peoples who depend on forest resources,” added the Forest Campaigner.

To avoid these impacts, the IMO should make sure high-ILUC fuels are excluded in the Framework. Major national and industry frameworks, including the EU’s Maritime and Aviation policies, the UK SAF Mandate, and the International Civil Aviation Authority’s CORSIA scheme, already exclude or cap high-ILUC biofuels, or include ILUC emissions in the life cycle accounting. The organizations said the IMO must not fall behind.

“We urge all IMO member governments to take a strong, united stance against the inclusion of biofuels in the Net-Zero Framework” said Pax Butchart, Biofuel Campaigner at Biofuelwatch.

“The science is clear: crop-based and waste-derived biofuels cannot deliver real emissions reductions. Governments now have a historic opportunity to steer the shipping sector toward truly clean, zero-emission solutions that protect people and the planet.”

Equally, biofuels produced from waste and residues such as used cooking oil (UCO), have limited availability and scalability, and won’t be able to satisfy the demand of international shipping in the long run.

“The IMO governments must now pursue truly sustainable alternatives, including improved energy efficiency, wind-assisted propulsion and reducing demand for maritime transport in international trade,” the organisations concluded.

Repsol on Monday (20 October) said it has signed a landmark eight-year agreement with Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NCLH) to supply renewable marine fuels at the Port of Barcelona.

Beginning in the 2026 European cruise season, Repsol will offer a portfolio of renewable fuels – starting with biofuels and, from 2029, renewable methanol – directly to NCLH’s vessels across its cruise brands—Norwegian Cruise Line, Oceania Cruises, and Regent Seven Seas Cruises—when calling at the Port of Barcelona.

“This milestone agreement highlights that renewable fuels are ready to play a key role in reducing the carbon footprint of the maritime sector. By partnering with NCLH, one of the world’s leading cruise companies, we show that renewable fuels are already deployable at scale to immediately start reducing emissions at sea,” said Juan Abascal, Repsol’s Executive Managing Director of Industrial Transformation and Circular Economy.

“This partnership is an excellent example of how cross-industry collaboration can unlock meaningful progress,” said Harry Sommer, president and chief executive officer of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.

“Securing long-term access to renewable marine fuels at a key European port aligns directly with our Sail & Sustain program and demonstrates our commitment to advancing towards a more sustainable future.”

The agreement between Repsol and NCLH was established based on the changing international regulatory environment and both companies’ pursuit of Net Zero by 2050. All fuels provided under the agreement are certified under the ISCC EU framework and meet the standards necessary to support NCLH’s environmental compliance and decarbonization roadmap.

The renewable methanol will be produced at Repsol’s Ecoplanta facility in Tarragona (Spain), a pioneering project in Europe to transform urban waste into renewable fuels and circular products, adding a solution for reducing CO2 emissions in the transport sector, while at the same time promoting the circular economy.

The new plant—set to begin operations in 2029— will have the capacity to process up to 400,000 tons of municipal solid waste per year and turn them into 240,000 tons of renewable fuels and circular products. NCLH is the first company to sign an offtake agreement for renewable methanol from the Ecoplanta facility.

The maritime industry is facing an increasingly complex regulatory landscape as it strives to meet decarbonisation targets, with new frameworks including the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) and FuelEU Maritime, alongside an upcoming IMO net zero framework, driving significant change, heard delegates at the Marine Fuels 360 conference in Singapore on Wednesday (8 October).

Kapil Berry, Business Development Director, Maritime, DNV highlighted each new regulation presents a more intricate scenario than the last, making compliance and strategic planning crucial for shipowners during his presentation ‘Leveraging Technology for Decarbonisation’.

“Though biofuels are currently considered the easiest drop-in bunker fuels to meet immediate compliance needs for FuelEU Maritime and IMO net zero goals, technological solutions remain at the forefront of this transition,” informed Berry.

He shared Wind-Assisted Propulsion Systems (WAPS), encompassing designs such as rotor sails and rigid wings, can achieve 5-20% fuel savings when installed. However, their implementation requires careful consideration of trading areas, air drafts, deck strengthening, and potential impacts on bridge visibility, with planning often needing at least two years before drydocking.

Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is also emerging as a significant pathway. Projections from DNV’s latest Maritime Forecast report suggest if 20 major ports establish offloading facilities and the largest bulk carriers, containerships, and tankers are fitted with CCS, it could offload approximately 90% of emissions from those vessels. This translates to 9% of overall maritime emissions, equivalent to 25 million metric tonnes (mt) of oil consumption by 2030.

Beyond advanced technologies, energy efficiency measures are emphasised as the “lowest hanging fruits” that can be implemented immediately, stated Berry.

He pointed out a DNV publication detailing over 40 energy efficiency technologies suggesting potential savings of up to 16% for shipowners.

Crucially, the transition towards net-zero shipping demands robust data management, believed Berry.

“The shift from manual reporting to automated, standardised, and verified data flows is essential for compliance with ETS, FuelEU Maritime, and net zero frameworks, as decisions involving millions or billions of dollars hinge on accurate data,” he said.

“To support the industry, DNV has developed a long-standing expert service available via email, providing responses within 24 hours, or four hours for urgent queries, routed through global data centres.”

French shipping company Sogestran Group recently said it has selected China Merchants Industry Yangzhou Dingheng Shipyard to build two new bunker vessels for long-time partner Petroineos.

Partners for over 34 years, Petroineos and Sogestran’s subsidiary Maritima are renewing their fleet dedicated to bunkering operations in the Fos, Marseille, and Toulon areas, reaffirming their local presence in the south of France.

Petroineos and Maritima will commission vessels for conventional bunkering and ready to supply low carbon fuels – B24, B100, HVO, e-Methanol.

The new bunker vessels will replace the current units – Florence B, Tatiana B, and Cap Pinede.

Their design has been specifically developed to optimise access to the Petroineos refinery jetties in Lavera. Each vessel will have a cargo capacity of 4,500 m³.

They will feature diesel-electric propulsion, powered by three electronically managed generator sets that adjust consumption to the vessel’s operational needs – a technical choice particularly well suited for ships operating over relatively short distances, and already adopted by Sogestran Group for the Pointe de Caux, launched in 2022.

The vessels will be equipped with two electric azimuth thrusters at the stern and a bow tunnel thruster, ensuring optimal manoeuvrability.

They will also be fitted with shore power connections and mass flow meters for quantity delivery monitoring.

Located on the Yangtze River, about 250 km from Shanghai, the shipyard specialises in vessels designed for the transport of oil and chemical products.

The designer of the bunker vessels is Deltamarin Shanghai. Steel cutting for the first vessel is scheduled for November 2026, with launch in 2027 and delivery in early 2028.

Against the backdrop of increasingly stringent international emission regulations and growing industry commitment to sustainability, the report provides insights into green shipping, covering IMO, EU, China and other nations’ initiatives, along with advancements in clean energy, emission reduction technologies, carbon trading and green ports.

Tightening global policy of green port and shipping

In 2024, the global economy remained under pressure from geopolitical risks and a high interest rate environment persist, though economic resilience has been enhanced. According to the International Monetary Fund’s (ITF) latest forecast, global growth is expected to be 3.2% in 2024, slightly below the 3.3% in 2023. The World Trade Organization (WTO) forecasts that global trade volume will grow by 2.7% in 2024, well above the downturn of 2023.

In this context, the global port and shipping industry faces a further increasing pressure of green environmental policy, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) continues to advance its strategy for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from ships and has put forward a draft of the “Net-Zero Framework”; The EU brought shipping into the carbon emissions trading system (EU ETS); the United States advanced cleaner port legislation and funding; and China has also issued stricter green port policy.

In the future, green environmental policies targeting the port and shipping industry will continue to be strengthened, the harbor and shipping enterprises face great pressure, green and low-carbon transformation has become the inevitable path for industry development.

The gradual scale-up of carbon trading market

Carbon trading markets are being established around the world since turning GHG emissions rights represented by carbon dioxide into commodities in the 1997 Kyoto agreement. According to the Global Carbon Market Progress Report issued by the International Carbon Action Partnership (ICAP), two new global carbon markets have been added in 2024, and by the end of the year, 38 carbon trading systems have been established, covering 23% GHG emissions, 58% of global GDP and one third of the world’ population with systems under consideration and development;.

The EU ETS remains the world’s largest market, with shipping officially incorporated into the EU carbon trading system from January 2024. The trading scale of China’s carbon emission allowances continues to expand, and the national voluntary greenhouse gas emission reduction trading (CCER) market will be restarted. In the future, the carbon trading market will become the primary regulatory mechanism for emission reduction of port and maritime industry.

Abundant application of marine clean energy

By September 2025, marine clean energy is still dominated by LNG, the volume of LNG and methanol is significantly increased, orders for hydrogen fuel ships are increased, ammonia fuel is distributed in major ports around the world, hydrogen fuel-cell technology is constantly maturing, and the price of biofuel is falling.

Totally, 210 ports worldwide can provide LNG refueling services. Singapore Port, as one of the main LNG refueling ports, saw a year-on-year increase of 318% in LNG refueling volume in 2024; 23 ports can provide methanol refueling services for ships. Among them, the methanol refueling volume of Rotterdam Port increased rapidly, with a year-on-year growth of 426% in 2024 and 894% in the first half of 2025. The first ammonia-fueled vessels are expected around 2026-2027, and pilot ammonia bunkering has been completed in Singapore, Rotterdam, Yokohama and Dalian ports.

The International Energy Agency (IEA) reports that, at present, renewable energy accounts for less than 4% of energy consumption in the transportation sector, but transport renewable demand could grow by around 3 EJ in 2024-2030 (about double the amount of previous six years).

Biofuels are regarded as a key energy source for reducing emissions in the shipping and aviation industries achieving a 2050 near-zero pathway implies raising biofuels’ share in transport energy from the current 6% toward 20%. In addition, with the continuous improvement of shore power facilities, the emission requirements of ships in ports will become stricter, and ships in ports will use more shore power or zero-carbon energy in the future.

Flourishing development of energy saving and emission reduction technologies

With the strengthening of environmental protection rules, there is a strong market demand for energy-efficiency and emission reduction technologies. Under such circumstances, the ship energy saving and emission reduction technology is increasingly abundant, in addition to various clean energy sources, there are more than 50 common energy-efficiency and emission reduction technologies including technical measures and various operation measures, and new technologies are still emerging. DNV predicts that by 2030, the shipping industry can reduce fuel consumption by 4% -16% through applicable technical measures and operation measures.

Typical technical measures include hull optimization, wind-assisted propulsion system, solar power and propeller optimization. Such emerging technologies can effectively improve fuel efficiency and reduce GHG emissions, but generally face the problems of higher CAPEX, longer payback time, higher maintenance cost and high requirements for ships and ports. Therefore, in adopting such technical measures, the shipowners need to balance cost against lifetime savings and regulatory benefits.

Operation measures mainly include route optimization, trim optimization, speed optimization and automatic driving. Such measures, which are often supported by digital decarbonization technologies to support ship operation decisions, have become an integral part of modern ship operations. In general, the technologies with remarkable emission reduction effect, high technical maturity, good adaptability, convenient installation and short payback time are more likely favored by the market. Over time, market tested technologies will be more widely applied.

The decarbonization of shipping is not only a regulatory necessity but also an opportunity to reimagine the future of maritime transport.

#3 Energy efficiency measures can reduce the total cost of the maritime energy transition by up to about $220 billion per year.
Improving the energy efficiency of the global merchant fleet is insufficient to meet the IMO’s policy objectives alone.","As explained, to better understand the tapped or untapped potential of technical and operational energy efficiency measures for maritime transport, and how this can help reduce transport costs for developing countries in the energy transition, the “Keys to Energy-Efficient Shipping” report addresses four main questions:

What is the overall contribution of energy efficiency measures to meeting the IMO’s checkpoints and net-zero target on the path to 2050 for the global fleet and main ship types?

What is the contribution of individual energy efficiency measures to cut GHG emissions, and how cost-effective are they?

How can energy efficiency contribute to a cost-effective energy transition pathway, and how do they work in conjunction with the long-term fuel transition?

What are the remaining barriers to maximizing energy efficiency in shipping, and what are the possible solutions?

Key findings

Following the quantitative and qualitative analysis, the report sets out four key findings for policymakers and industry to consider:

#1 Energy efficiency measures can reduce ship emissions by up to about 40 percent in 2030, exceeding the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) policy objectives.

Technical and operational energy efficiency measures offer a maximum potential to reduce absolute GHG emissions by 23–39 percent in 2030 relative to 2008 levels, clearly exceeding the IMO’s base level of ambition of 20 percent in 2030 and at a maximum exceeding the IMO’s high-level ambition of 30 percent.

The largest untapped potential in the short term lies in ship speed reductions for the overall fleet, reducing GHG emissions by 5–15 percent, with additional savings achievable by optimizing voyage speed into congested ports. Beyond 2030, the contribution of technical measures, such as changes in ship design and the addition of new equipment, is expected to increase.

As the global fleet’s fuel transition to green fuels is still ramping up, energy efficiency improvements are promising short-term solutions. While energy efficiency measures are insufficient to meet the IMO’s 2050 target—at a maximum lowering GHG emissions to about 40 percent below 2008 levels—they will also complement the fuel transition beyond 2030 and reduce ships’ reliance on fossil fuel.

#2 About half of emissions savings from energy efficiency measures are considered cost-effective in 2030, cutting 250 million tons of emissions at no cost.

By 2030, cost-effective energy efficiency measures could fully pay for themselves by lowering shipping’s fuel costs. For bulk carriers, container ships, and tankers—which account for nearly 80 percent of shipping GHG emissions—the majority of energy efficiency measures are cost-effective. However, marginal abatement costs for individual measures vary by ship type, primarily due to differences in ship design and operational requirements.

Tankers have the least cost-effective abatement due to relatively higher installation costs of technologies and technical limitations when reducing speed. Bulk carriers offer favorable design features for wind-assisted propulsion, while container ships show high abatement effectiveness in reducing speed.

#3 Energy efficiency measures can reduce the total cost of the maritime energy transition by up to about $220 billion per year.

Improving the energy efficiency of the global merchant fleet is insufficient to meet the IMO’s policy objectives alone. Therefore, green fuels, such as methanol and ammonia, will be indispensable in 2040 and 2050 but are more expensive than conventional fuels. A cost-efficient route to meeting the sector’s GHG emissions targets is to prioritize energy efficiency, which reduces the fuel consumption of the fleet and, therefore, the overall cost of the transition. Annual capital investments in energy efficiency across the fleet of about $35 billion can save up to $270 billion in green fuel costs per year.

Investments in energy efficiency measures also offer mitigation to fuel price volatility and will be a critical component of the fuel transition when green fuels are still more expensive.

#4 Despite their potential, several top candidate energy efficiency measures in merchant shipping remain underused because of sector-specific economic, behavioral, and organizational barriers.

While promising, some of the candidate measures with the highest GHG emissions savings and lowest uptake—such as wind-assisted ship propulsion, air lubrication, and port call optimization (PCO)—remain untapped to date. An explanation for the lack of investment and implementation of cost-effective measures is due to known economic, behavioral, and organizational barriers, which are also common barriers to implementing energy efficiency improvements in other sectors.

Specifically, imperfect information, split incentives, and asymmetric information are the most significant market failures, while non-market failures such as access to capital, hidden costs, perceptions of technology risk, and market heterogeneity contribute to the lack of uptake of technical measures. Behavioral and organizational barriers are particularly important to address to increase the uptake of PCO by ports and the shipping industry.

Action points

Energy efficiency has significant potential for global shipping but remains largely untapped to date. While there are public- and private-led initiatives underway, significant barriers persist. How can the remaining barriers be addressed, and who is best placed to lead such efforts?

Policymakers

Regulatory bodies set the standards for the safety, security, and environmental performance of ships. They play a major role in creating an enabling environment for realizing the full potential of energy efficiency.

Advance performance standards: Performance standards have been the backbone of a uniquely regulated global shipping sector. They hold some of the greatest potential to address longstanding market failures and barriers, such as information barriers, which prevent firms from responding only to price signals. International performance standards (for example, EEDI, CII) can be strengthened and considered by IMO member states in their future work plans.

Explore alternative instruments: Other instruments (for example, emission levies, subsidies) can also provide additional demand- and supply-side incentives, especially as there is growing recognition that a combination of multiple climate policy instruments may be needed to decarbonize industries. The large untapped potential of energy efficiency, especially to help make shipping costs more resilient to absolute fuel price volatility, rerouting shocks, and fuel transition cost, presents an opportunity for national, regional, and international policymakers.

Industry

The shipping industry is both an enabler and beneficiary of increased energy efficiency. Actors range from shipowners and shippers to equipment manufacturers.

Develop information standards: Alongside regulatory intervention, voluntary information standards can complement policies to help address imperfect information market failures and harmonize data exchange. Industry initiatives can help innovative technologies gain market acceptance. Validation guidelines for technology performance, and ultimately fuel savings, are important to grow investor confidence through consistent terminology (ITTC 2024).

Foster demonstration projects: Third-party verified data on technology demonstrations in real operating conditions would also help improve access to capital and increase the business case for charterers and shipowners.

Ports and port community

Port stakeholders are critical actors to foster the uptake of promising port-centric energy efficiency measures, such as port call optimization, and infrastructure-related options such as onshore power supply.

Explore national or local policies: National and local (port) policies can encourage these port development activities by considering how regulatory instruments can be used, as ports do not traditionally fall under the regulatory realm of the IMO.

Share best practices: Learnings from ports that are more advanced in implementing port call optimization can help those at earlier stages of implementation to address adoption challenges. This is especially important for ports operating under a landlord model where private terminals control berth planning data.

Adopt digital solutions: These initiatives can be supported by software systems such as port community systems or maritime single windows, which facilitate data sharing across multiple stakeholders. Adoption of global digital data standards that establish definitions of port locations and port call timestamps from universally accepted IMO and International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) standards is crucial to improve communication on port calls and arrival times between ship operators and ports, enabling port call optimization.

Finance

As uptake lags, access to capital is essential for financing investments in energy efficiency technologies and systems, both on board ships and at port facilities.",https://safety4sea.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/sustainability-shutterstock_2164376069-e1761037135888.jpg,N,,2025-10-21 06:16:42.469145

The proposal has drawn worldwide criticism for its from economic impacts and threats to national sovereignty.

The tax, called for by the U.N.’s International Maritime Organization (IMO), would require major shipping companies to pay them fees for their carbon emissions beginning in 2027. The Trump administration will not allow the U.N. “to tax American companies or citizens for simply doing business,” Rubio vowed.

“The United States will not cede economic authority to an international body,” the Secretary of State said. “This so-called climate tax would raise energy, food, and fuel prices while enriching the U.N. bureaucracy.” He is urging other countries to join the U.S. in rejecting the plan to defend national sovereignty and economic independence.

Under the IMO’s Net-Zero Framework, large oceangoing vessels would be forced to transition to low-emission fuels or face heavy penalties. Companies emitting beyond designated limits would pay between $100 and $380 per metric ton of carbon dioxide, depending on the ship’s size, efficiency, and type of fuel used. The framework would be legally binding for the IMO’s 176 member nations, including the United States, which has been a member since 1950.

The State Department last week threatened to impose port fees, trade restrictions, or sanctions on countries that adopt the measure. “We’re not going to allow unelected international bureaucrats to dictate America’s energy policy,” Rubio said.

According to the IMO, funds collected under the tax would support low-emission technologies, “just transition” projects in developing nations, and financial incentives for greener ships. Critics argue the plan amounts to a massive global redistribution scheme, with potential revenue estimated up to $12 billion annually, and warn it could disadvantage American companies in the global market.",https://dd3vw9csp56u7.cloudfront.net/assets/southshorepress/favicon/favicon-32x32-3b6b58244d297f3523a157800cd2a45f5770adfe72a0e6604a1a1afc060eb73b.png,N,,2025-10-21 06:16:47.126410

The Jefferies analysts point to a trend where dual fueled capable vessel orders had moved in the direction of LNG, with growing concerns as to the widespread availability of methanol, and the safety of ammonia.
They note that: “This was most obvious with the large wave of containership newbuilding orders placed last year, in which industry giants ordered LNG dual-fuel ships after previously focusing on methanol.""
Citing data from Clarksons, Jefferies said that: “Dual Fuel / Alternative propulsion makes up 41% of the orderbook,” as measured by CGT (though only 16% in the orderbook would be able to use an alternative fuel immediately upon entering service).
In contrast, on routes with limited service or monopolistic conditions, carriers that face little competitive pressure are more inclined to pass the full costs on to consumers and domestic exporters.” Resource:","In the aftermath of the International Maritime Organization's (IMO) decision to postpone adoption of its proposed Net Zero Framework, analysts of shipping equities, but also observers of the broader energy marketplace, are weighing in on the possible impacts regarding the actual shipping markets.

Jefferies’ analyst Omar Nokta and his team published a group of reports touching on the practical implications; the bottom line, as stated in a report issued on the Monday following the IMO’s retreat the previous Friday, is that: “We expect a consequence of last week's indecision will be a shift back to conventional fuel engines for new vessel orders and for many of those currently in the orderbook.”

They asserted that “The IMO's goal of reducing GHG emissions by 40% relative to 2008 levels by 2030 and to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 are now at risk.”

In the interactions of vessel supply and vessel demand, uncertainty regarding suitable fuels had arguably reduced the magnitude of new orders in recent years, as the IMO was on its course towards a longer-term plan for incentivizing alternative fuels. A variant on this line of thinking suggested that the magnitude of ordering for dual fueled vessels or alternatively fueled ships had been constrained since the dual fueled assets are more expensive than their conventionally fueled counterparts.

The Jefferies analysts point to a trend where dual fueled capable vessel orders had moved in the direction of LNG, with growing concerns as to the widespread availability of methanol, and the safety of ammonia. They note that: “This was most obvious with the large wave of containership newbuilding orders placed last year, in which industry giants ordered LNG dual-fuel ships after previously focusing on methanol.""

The data on the subject is nuanced. The Jefferies team discuss dual fuel “capable” vessels able to run on alternative fuel at the time of delivery, suggesting that this type of flexibility adds $10-15 million to the construction cost, compared to a conventionally fueled vessel or a dual fuel “ready” ship, where actual alternative fueling systems might be added at a later date. Citing data from Clarksons, Jefferies said that: “Dual Fuel / Alternative propulsion makes up 41% of the orderbook,” as measured by CGT (though only 16% in the orderbook would be able to use an alternative fuel immediately upon entering service).

They suggest that: “We expect many to shift their dual-fuel ""capable"" newbuildings to dual-fuel ""ready"" to lower capex, especially for 2027 and onward deliveries (when engine changes can still be made). If there is one benefit to the IMO's stalled initiatives, it is that shipping costs may be coming down.”

Analysts from the Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy (CGEP), looking at geopolitics rather than shipping markets but benefitting from previous affiliations with a leading New York headquartered shipbroker in the LNG and gas marketplace) note that impacts on shipping companies are far from uniform.

They write that: “Large shipping firms are considerably more likely to be able to absorb the added cost of remedial units and retrofitting their fleet, and to be able to endure the initial discomfort of an inevitable lack of supply within the low-emissions fuel market. With access to capital and larger fleets, they can retrofit vessels, secure scarce supplies of low-emission fuels, and use credit trading to offset penalties, effectively balancing the costs of older, less-efficient ships against the performance of those already prepared to run on green methanol or ammonia.” The discussion notes that smaller operators might potentially be disadvantaged.

The Jefferies equity analysts are implicitly voicing the same sentiment, mentioning at least one “industry giant” in their discussions of vessel ordering rationale, as they noted: “The uncertainty on future propulsion has been a key reason many in the industry have shied away from ordering new vessels while others, including Maersk, had hoped infrastructure investments to make alternative fuels more available would justify methanol or ammonia powered vessels.”

The Columbia University scholars also hinted at different impacts across different routes, saying: “On highly competitive routes, carriers have an incentive to absorb part of the compliance costs in order to protect their market share. In contrast, on routes with limited service or monopolistic conditions, carriers that face little competitive pressure are more inclined to pass the full costs on to consumers and domestic exporters.”

More than 100 countries had gathered in London to approve the deal first announced in April 2025. However, the US administration was vociferous in its criticism of the scheme, with president Donald Trump going as far as threatening tariffs on countries that voted in favour of it. Ultimately, a motion to delay by a year was passed.

April’s agreement had meant that from 2028 ship operators would have to use increasingly cleaner fuels or face fines. Champions of the deal welcomed a global standard for marine shipping emissions. Some detractors voiced concerns around raised prices for consumers, while others stated that it did not go far enough to address the climate crisis.

Ultimately, many large shipowners/operators, primarily in the container business, have advanced with newbuilding schemes that lean into alternative fuels. With skin in the game, it’s hard to see them reversing those investments on the basis of a one-year delay. However, it does beg the question of what smaller, niche carriers will do with regard to fleet renewal.

Many multipurpose vessel operators, for instance, have been reluctant to place newbuild orders en masse in the present environment. Not only are newbuild prices prohibitively high, the question of alternative fuel availability beyond the major bunkering hubs remains unanswered.

The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Shanghai Green Shipping Corridor, the first partnership of its kind across the Pacific, reached a new milestone on Monday (20 October).

The LA-LB-SH Green Shipping Corridor (GSC), facilitated by C40 Cities, has successfully delivered on its phase 1 milestones, including the expansion of shore power infrastructure to meet 100% electrification serving container vessels, deploying reduced lifecycle carbon-capable vessels, and scaling sustainable fuel bunkering operations.

The corridor partners presented their second Annual Progress Report at the North Bund International Shipping Forum 2025 on 20 October.

The report highlighted the significant progress made by the Partnership since the launch of the GSC, specifically over the past year, and outlines the steps planned to achieve future milestones, including demonstrating the feasibility of deploying zero lifecycle carbon emission container ships by 2030.

In March 2025, partners gathered at the Port of Long Beach for the second in-person meeting, in which the corridor partners reaffirmed their consensus on the corridor goals, further detailed additional actions for addressing challenges, and launched a fourth working group to focus on Metrics and Evaluation.

Along with the other dedicated working groups – Energy Supply, Carriers, and Ports– the partners continue to make progress towards their respective missions:

Ports Working Group

Expanded shore power infrastructure to reach 100% capability in Shanghai, Los Angeles, and Long Beach, cutting emissions while ships are docked and improving air quality for local communities. The Los Angeles and Long Beach Ports completed the installation of shore power to meet earlier mandated State regulations.

Bunkered more than 47,000 metric tonnes (mt) of green methanol at the Port of Shanghai, and realised China’s first linkage for domestically produced green methanol. Ports of LA and Long Beach are preparing for a methanol pilot project.

Commissioned a Clean Fuels Study for POLA/POLB and prepared for a clean marine fuel pilot project.

Building on the successful completion of Phase One milestone targets, the partners will continue to tackle significant challenges in 2026 and beyond:

Addressing the future of clean marine fuels due to the shifting regulatory, permitting, and policy landscape, such as the IMO’s Net Zero Framework.

Addressing market uncertainty on clean marine fuel supply and demand.

While some in the maritime industry has expressed disappointment as the International Maritime Organization (IMO) postponed its global Net-Zero Framework (NZF) for another year, others said the time should be used to close remaining gaps and further develop it.

NZF includes a global fuel standard for shipping and an economic measure, which consists of a pricing mechanism and credit trading scheme to drive down emissions and fund the transition to zero and low carbon fuels.

IBIA had expected, together with a significant number of international associations, a different outcome of the extraordinary MEPC.

“The MEPC Special Session this week demonstrated that the issue of reducing GHG emissions from ships, and in particular, the pricing of emissions, is politically contentious for many countries to the point that achieving a consensus at this stage is not possible and means the draft amendments for consideration will now have to be revised before being tabled again and pausing it for one year,” IBIA said in a statement.

IBIA supported the adoption of the NZF and were already engaged in crucial work on the detailed guidelines.

“Meanwhile, a majority of IMO’s Member States weren’t prepared to move ahead, making shipping the first sector with a global regulatory framework to decarbonise,” IBIA added.

“A working group meeting at IMO next week to prepare implementing guidelines will see an attempt to heal the diplomatic scars of this week.”

“IBIA will continue to support IMO and its work, and in doing so, represent the views of the whole of the marine energy supply chain.”

The International Association of Ports and Harbors (IAPH) considered the postponement of the adoption of the IMO Net Zero Framework as a major setback for a global framework that the industry needs to secure investments in decarbonisation at sea and on land.

IAPH managing director Patrick Verhoeven, said: “This is a major setback for the maritime industry. Shipping and ports need a global framework that provides them with legal certainty to make the necessary investments in decarbonisation.

“Only IMO can provide such a framework. We don’t know what this adjournment will lead to, but we fear it will simply open the door for more national and regional measures, which will add to an already complex regulatory patchwork resulting in unintended consequences.”

“The adjournment of the IMO Net Zero Framework now spells uncertainty about the incentives that are needed for the uptake of new low and zero carbon fuels.”

Thomas A. Kazakos, International Chamber of Shipping (ICS) Secretary General, said: “We are disappointed that member states have not been able to agree a way forward at this meeting. Industry needs clarity to be able to make the investments needed to decarbonise the maritime sector, in line with the goals set out in the IMO GHG strategy.

The World Shipping Council (WSC) has underlined the importance of using the year ahead to clarify and develop the IMO Net-Zero Framework.

“The IMO remains the right place to deliver a global solution. We are committed to continuing work with governments to deliver the necessary regulatory consistency, support renewable fuel production and infrastructure, and keep shipping’s energy transition on track,” the council said.

International nature conservation organisations Biofuelwatch, Forest Watch Indonesia and Global Forest Coalition on Monday (20 October) urged the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) to exclude harmful biofuels from compliance with the Net-Zero Framework.

Last week, during the Extraordinary Session of the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC ES.2) in London, countries decided to postpone the decision on the adoption of the Framework to 2026.

But important discussions will continue on 20 to 24 October on key details on clean energy incentives in the Framework, and the organisations stressed the importance of preventing biofuels from being included as a supposed “green” alternative to fossil fuels.

Decades of evidence show that indirect land use change (ILUC) emissions from crop-based biofuels – such as soy and oil palm – wipe out their claimed climate benefits, driving forest loss, food insecurity, and land and water grabbing as agriculture is displaced onto marginal or uncultivated land. Soy and oil palm-based biofuels can generate emissions even higher than fossil fuels.

“Biofuels are not a sustainable solution under any circumstances. In Latin America, the push for soy-based biofuels has accelerated deforestation and driven communities off their lands. If the IMO creates new demand for biofuels, it will unleash more emissions, more inequality, and more land grabbing” said Jana Uemura, Climate Campaigner at the Global Forest Coalition.

“Rejecting biofuels in the Net-Zero Framework means protecting the world’s remaining tropical forests – critical carbon sinks and biodiversity hotspots.” said Anggi Putra Prayoga, Forest Campaigner at Forest Watch Indonesia.

“The climate crisis is already real. It is crucial to take a firm stance on adopting truly zero-emission energy sources, rather than biofuels that generate new emissions through deforestation.”

“The loss of forests not only worsens emissions but also endangers the lives and rights of Indigenous peoples who depend on forest resources,” added the Forest Campaigner.

To avoid these impacts, the IMO should make sure high-ILUC fuels are excluded in the Framework. Major national and industry frameworks, including the EU’s Maritime and Aviation policies, the UK SAF Mandate, and the International Civil Aviation Authority’s CORSIA scheme, already exclude or cap high-ILUC biofuels, or include ILUC emissions in the life cycle accounting. The organizations said the IMO must not fall behind.

“We urge all IMO member governments to take a strong, united stance against the inclusion of biofuels in the Net-Zero Framework” said Pax Butchart, Biofuel Campaigner at Biofuelwatch.

“The science is clear: crop-based and waste-derived biofuels cannot deliver real emissions reductions. Governments now have a historic opportunity to steer the shipping sector toward truly clean, zero-emission solutions that protect people and the planet.”

Equally, biofuels produced from waste and residues such as used cooking oil (UCO), have limited availability and scalability, and won’t be able to satisfy the demand of international shipping in the long run.

“The IMO governments must now pursue truly sustainable alternatives, including improved energy efficiency, wind-assisted propulsion and reducing demand for maritime transport in international trade,” the organisations concluded.

They also point to the growing issues of agricultural displacement and food insecurity demanding that the IMO exclude biofuels from the green alternatives in the Net-Zero Framework.

“Biofuels are not a sustainable solution under any circumstances,” said Jana Uemura, Climate Campaigner at the Global Forest Coalition. “If the IMO creates new demand for biofuels, it will unleash more emissions, more inequality, and more land grabbing.”

The groups point to data released earlier this year by the NGO T&E that said international shipping could become the fourth largest biofuel consumer, driving more demand for biofuels coming from food and feed crops. T&E estimated that biofuels could make up more than a third (36 percent) of the global fuel mix by 2030 with the share increased to 59 percent by 2035 and 76 percent by 2040. It would be mostly derived from soy and palm oil.

“We urge all IMO member governments to take a strong, united stance against the inclusion of biofuels in the Net-Zero Framework” said Pax Butchart, Biofuel Campaigner at Biofuelwatch. “The science is clear: crop-based and waste-derived biofuels cannot deliver real emissions reductions.”

The groups fear because it is a lower cost alternative, used cooking oil biofuel will attract strong demand far beyond its capacity. They note that the supply is highly constrained and largely already used in the transport sector. The global waste oil supply currently used for biofuel production, they assert, could only meet about five percent of shipping’s energy demand. With the limited supply, they fear the next alternative will be indirect land use change biofuels, contributing to crop displacement and food insecurity.

The groups highlight that major national and industry frameworks, including the EU’s Maritime and Aviation policies, the UK SAF Mandate, and the International Civil Aviation Authority’s CORSIA scheme, already exclude or cap high-ILUC biofuels, or include ILUC emissions in the life cycle accounting.",https://maritime-executive.com/media/images/article/Biofuelwatch-protest-at-IMO.5f8467.jpg,N,,2025-10-21 02:17:09.984073

We now urge the public and industry to keep pushing for immediate action to cut emissions from global shipping.” Photo credit: iStock/ Tran Van Quyet","As a special meeting of the International Maritime Organization’s Marine Environment Protection Committee (IMO, MEPC/ES.2) closes in London, the Clean Shipping Coalition expressed its huge disappointment in the decision by member states to delay consideration of the adoption of the IMO’s Net-Zero Framework (NZF) for one year and called on member states to use the time to ensure the framework is strengthened and adopted next time round.

John Maggs, Clean Shipping Coalition’s representative at IMO, said: “By delaying adoption of its Net Zero Framework, IMO has today squandered an important opportunity to tackle global shipping’s contribution to climate breakdown.

“With climate warming impacts being felt everywhere on Earth, kicking this decision down the road is simply evading reality. Governments serious about climate action must spend the next 12 months rallying every nation that supports the framework, convincing those who are on the fence, or opposing, that its adoption is the only sane way forward.

“However, all is not lost – not by a long shot, as there is an immediate opportunity to slash GHG emissions from shipping, minimize fuel burn and the overall cost of the energy transition and that is to strengthen and make enforceable the Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII), the IMO’s cornerstone energy efficiency measure.

“There’s no time to waste, at MEPC 84 April 2026 member states need to focus all their attention on transforming the CII into the energy efficiency powerhouse needed to quickly right this ship and put it back on route to being a climate solution.

“While the Net-Zero Framework is far from perfect, adopting it would have been an important step to deliver on the IMOs commitment and send key signals to an industry that was not only asking for a global framework, but actively supported this deal.”

The IMO’s NZF is aimed at reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from ships, in line with its GHG Strategy. The NZF includes a global fuel standard, requiring ships “to gradually reduce how polluting its ship fuel can be (i.e., how much greenhouse gas is emitted for each unit of energy used, across a fuel’s life cycle)”. It also includes a mechanism for setting prices on the GHG ships emit, to encourage the shipping industry to lower emissions as per the global fuel standard.

Elissama Menezes, co-founder and director, Equal Routes, said: “Delay costs the climate — and coastal, Indigenous Peoples and Arctic communities are already paying the price for inaction.

“This week’s non-outcome should mean that states and the marine sector should double down on related efforts to reduce the impacts from the triple planetary crisis.

“Implementing revised CII targets to improve efficiency of the global fleet; investing in wind to promote its scaling up; agreeing to comprehensive well to wake LCA guidelines which ensure all methane-based fuels aren’t part of decarbonation pathways; and adopting mandatory measures in early 2026 at PPR13 to reduce black carbon from shipping emissions can all be moved on now to support the sector’s zero by 2050 ambitions.” LCA refers to life cycle assessment.

Alison Shaw, IMO manager, Transport & Environment, said: “The delay leaves the shipping sector drifting in uncertainty. But this week has also shown that there is a clear desire to clean up the shipping industry, even in the face of U.S. bullying.

“The world cannot let intimidation and vested interests dictate the pace of climate action. Climate-ambitious countries must use this moment to build a strong majority in support of meaningful decarbonization. They will be the ones that benefit from the economy of tomorrow, not the geopolitical power games of the past.”

Anaïs Rios, senior shipping policy officer, Seas At Risk, said: “Getting the NZF adopted in this MEPC ES.2, however imperfect, was fundamental for shipping to stay within reach of its own decarbonation targets.

“Emotions have run high this week at the IMO, with once high-ambitious alliances wavering and strategies eclipsing reason. With talk of unity versus division, no single flag should dictate the world’s climate course. With countries like Saudi Arabia leading efforts to delay, few expected a postponement to prevail but here we are.

“What matters now is that countries rise up and come back to the IMO with a louder and more confident yes vote that cannot be silenced. The planet and the future of shipping does not have time to waste.”

Jenny Helle, expert on decarbonization of aviation and shipping, Carbon Market Watch, said: “The adoption of NZF would have marked a crucial first step toward reducing global shipping emissions and supporting vulnerable countries in the transition.

“Far from rushed, it represented years of negotiations, research, and collective effort. It was a clear and urgent demand from both the industry and the public. Yet, due to pressure from the Trump administration and major fossil fuel producing countries, this opportunity for progress was lost. We now urge the public and industry to keep pushing for immediate action to cut emissions from global shipping.”

In the interim, UN member states will continue to work towards consensus on the framework.

The IMO is a specialized agency of the UN that regulates maritime transport. The organization in April 2025 took a step toward establishing a legally binding framework to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from ships globally, aiming to achieve net-zero emissions by or near 2050. The proposed framework is the first of its kind to combine mandatory emissions limits and GHG pricing across an entire industry sector.

The Net Zero Framework was approved by the IMO’s Marine Environmental Protection Committee in April. A vote to formally adopt the framework was expected to be held during the extraordinary session of the MEPC, which convened Oct. 14-17. The IMO, however, on Oct. 17 announced efforts to formally adopt the framework will be delayed for one year, with the extraordinary session set to reconvene in October 2026. The Intersessional Working Group on the Reduction of Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Ships, scheduled to meet Oct. 20-24, will go ahead an continue to work on the guidelines for implementing the Net Zero Framework.

The framework, as approved in April, was expected to enter into force in 2027 and be mandatory for large ocean-going ships of over 5,000 gross tonnage, which the IMO said emit 85% of total CO2 emissions from international shipping.

The draft regulations include a global fuel standard and global economic measure. Under the global fuel standard, ships would be required to recue their annual GHG fuel intensity (GFI) over time. GHG reductions would be calculated using a well-to-wake approach. Under the global economic measures, ships emitting above the GFI thresholds would have to acquire remedial units to balance its deficit emissions, while those using zero or near-zero GHG technologies would be eligible for financial rewards. The proposal included two levels of compliance with GFI targets, including a base target and a direct compliance target at which ships would be eligible to earn surplus units.

Adoption of the ICO’s Net Zero Framework was expected to boost demand for biobased fuels, according to comments made by U.S. renewable fuel producers ahead of the Oct. 17 vote. According to Roeslein Renewables, the framework could significantly boost demand for renewable natural gas (RNG)-based fuels and biodiesel. Vanguard Renewables also noted the framework was expected to boost RNG demand while the U.S. Grains & Bioproducts Council stressed the framework could create new opportunities for the ethanol industry.",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/archived/biomassmagazine/posts/web/2012/10/ShipBulkCarrier_13498013901506.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 20:16:33.766529

Three Cabinet secretaries have issued a warning to other countries not to approve the so-called Net Zero Framework (NZF), which is generally considered to be a carbon tax on global shipping.

See here for the text of the warning.

The IMO was supposed to pass the NZF at its October meeting, but the Trump warning had a clear effect, so that vote never happened. All they did was vote to postpone voting on the emission reduction compliance program until the next meeting. Now the fight really begins.

NZF is not actually a tax, just penalties for failing to meet agreed-on emission limits, but it is still potentially costly so call it a tax. The IMO fact sheet is here.

Basically, each ship gets an assigned cap on CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions per unit of energy expended. The caps get progressively lower over time, heading for zero in 2050.

If a ship gets below its cap it gets “surplus unit” (SU) credits for the difference that it can sell. If it exceeds the cap a little it must buy “Tier 1 remedial units (RU)” from IMO. If it exceeds the cap a lot it can either buy SUs or Tier 2 RUs which cost about four times as much as Tier 1 RUs.

It is buying the remedial units that amounts to a carbon tax on emissions, which by some estimates will be enormous. The Trump administration said in a press release that America “unequivocally rejects this proposal before the IMO and will not tolerate any action that increases costs for our citizens, energy providers, shipping companies and their customers, or tourists. The economic impacts from this measure could be disastrous, with some estimates forecasting global shipping costs increasing as much as 10% or more.”

Decarbonization of shipping is pretty much impossible, because it cannot be electrified. The sea lanes cannot be lined with charging stations. Refitting every ship in the world with nuclear propulsion would be even more expensive. Burning wood or corn might be even worse.

The net-zero thinkers are not known for reality, but, in this case, the greater the failure the more money they make. No wonder they like it!

Nor can the U.S. just walk away because shipping is truly global. Here is how the IMO fact sheet explains enforcement of things like NZF:

“Enforcement of all IMO regulations lies with the Member States, in their capacity as flag, port or coastal States. When a government accedes to an IMO Convention, it agrees to make it part of its own national law and to enforce it just like any other law. A Flag State must ensure that ships under its registry comply with IMO’s international rules and standards, including safety, environmental protection and labour conditions. A Port State has the right to inspect foreign ships in national ports to verify that compliance with IMO rules.”

How do foreign ports enforce NZF compliance on American ships? Or any ships for that matter. There is real potential for violence here, with a lot of money at stake.

Clearly the potential for disruption from the ill-conceived UN IMO NZF is enormous, and the fight is just beginning. Stay tuned to CFACT as this drama unfolds.",https://www.cfact.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Container-ship-dollars.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 21:01:25.257830

We will now have to double-down on other means to drive shipping GHG reduction and energy transition.
As long as that is the stated strategy, the IMO should in theory make progress toward adopting regulations in line with it.","A scheduled Extraordinary Session of the IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee has ended without adopting the policy measures agreed upon in principle in April 2025. These measures are intended to reduce emissions from the shipping sector and kick-start the sector’s energy transition.

The meeting failed to complete the next milestone toward the entry into force of the “Net Zero Framework”. In the decision taken at the end of the week, a vote was called for by Saudi Arabia to adjourn the meeting for one year. The vote resulted in 57 countries accepting the motion, forming a majority of those present and voting, and the meeting was subsequently adjourned.

Dr Tristan Smith, Professor of Energy and Transport at UCL Energy Institute Shipping & Oceans Research Group said: “This is catastrophic for confidence, and therefore also for the equitable and ambitious decarbonisation we need. We will now have to double-down on other means to drive shipping GHG reduction and energy transition. Climate science tells us that the challenge of decarbonisation does not go away, it gets harder. This delay therefore means those with the means must step up and lead more than ever, until this multilateral process can regain its composure.”

A vote was also called at the MEPC 83 meeting in April 2025, agreeing in principle to the legal amendment to MARPOL Annex VI. A number of countries changed their positions relative to that vote, providing evidence that well-publicised threats from the United States, including tariffs and reprisals for any country that supported the Framework, and related pressure, were effective at changing positions. On this occasion, that pressure appears to have been effective.

Dr Annika Frosch, Research Fellow at UCL Energy Institute Shipping & Oceans Research Group said: “The adoption of the Net Zero Framework by the IMO would have marked a crucial step forward for shipping decarbonization. Although adoption has been postponed, the process remains underway, with key technical guidelines now the focus before potential adoption in 2026.”

The decision on the IMO’s Net Zero Framework does not override or change the foundation of the GHG Reduction Strategy that was adopted at MEPC 80 in 2023. This unanimously adopted strategy commits the organisation to absolute GHG emission reductions of 20-30% in 2030 and 70-80% in 2040, on a pathway to reaching net-zero emissions by/around 2050. As long as that is the stated strategy, the IMO should in theory make progress toward adopting regulations in line with it. However the outcome at IMO means further work on regional and national regulation of international shipping has now been vindicated, making current regulations such as those in EU likely to be prolonged. We could now see more regions taking similar action.

Dr Pinar Langer, Research Fellow at UCL Energy Institute Shipping & Oceans Research Group said: “This unexpected delay highlights both the complexity and the high stakes of reaching global alignment on shipping’s net-zero transition. The year ahead offers a vital window for constructive engagement and for strengthening the evidence base to ensure that when the framework is finally adopted, it is both equitable and actionable across diverse national contexts.”",,N,,2025-10-20 23:16:34.078362

Although biofuels create far fewer emissions in transport than standard oil-based fuels, many still come at significant environmental costs, since their production can release carbon through deforestation and intensive farming practices that offset much of their supposed climate benefit. An analysis commissioned by the European Union in 2015 found that, in some cases, converting farmland to grow mass amounts of soy and palm oil creates more emissions than burning fossil fuels.

In Indonesia, large-scale expansion of oil palm plantations in order to meet global biofuel demand has driven widespread deforestation and peatland loss. According to Human Rights Watch, peatlands in Indonesia store roughly 80 billion tons of carbon, and when they are burned to clear the way for palm oil cultivation, that carbon is released into the atmosphere, causing massive spikes in greenhouse gas emissions, and creating toxic haze events that have blanketed much of Southeast Asia in recent decades.

In the interim, member states will continue to work towards consensus on the IMO framework.

The Intersessional Working Group on the Reduction on Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Ships, scheduled to meet Oct. 20-24, will continue work on the guidelines for implementing the net-zero framework, IMO stated.

The net-zero framework was approved at the MEPC 83 session in April, as a new Chapter 5 of the Draft Revised Annex VI of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL).

It comprises a set of international regulations aimed at reducing greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions from ships, in line with IMO’s 2023 strategy for the reduction of GHG emissions from ships.

It includes two key elements: a global fuel standard and global GHG-emissions pricing mechanism.

Various organizations responded to the IMO’s decision to delay the adoption of the framework.

The Singapore-based Global Centre for Maritime Decarbonization said on Oct. 17, “The team at GCMD, while disappointed by the outcome at MEPC last night, woke up with renewed resolve this morning. The industry faces a complex journey—one that requires us to be pragmatic yet forward-looking. GCMD’s approach will continue to reflect the reality of a heterogeneous sector: running alongside frontrunners who push technological boundaries, supporting followers who seek commercial certainty, and enabling conservatives who are ready to embark on their decarbonization strategy. Fundamentally, GCMD believes nothing has changed in the industry’s ultimate destination: net-zero emissions. Regional efforts, such as EU regulations, remain in force and are expanding, and other regions will likely also step up to take leadership in light of what happened last night. While a global framework would have provided uniform clarity sooner, the direction of travel is clear and should drive action—the work does not stop simply because the vote is postponed.”

Lloyd’s Register said the IMO’s adoption of the framework “would have provided a global regulatory framework for the reduction of GHG energy intensity of international shipping.”

Lloyd’s Register further added that it believes “the least disruptive and most equitable route for the maritime industry’s energy transition is through a global, multilateral, transparent policy with the IMO. This will provide the framework for how the industry should decarbonize, creating the consistency, confidence and collaboration needed to drive investment and accelerate progress. It will be seen in the coming weeks what actions the IMO member states will take in this matter.”","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/80995f_ee15dc8d9f474173a86b2ed514101d5f~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_1000,h_474,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/80995f_ee15dc8d9f474173a86b2ed514101d5f~mv2.jpg",N,,2025-10-20 21:01:34.897157

Last week, during the Extraordinary Session of the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC ES.2) in London, countries decided to postpone the decision on the adoption of the Framework to 2026. But important discussions will continue on 20–24 October on key details on clean energy incentives in the Framework, and the organizations stress the importance of preventing biofuels from being included as a supposed “green” alternative to fossil fuels.

Decades of evidence show that indirect land use change (ILUC) emissions from crop-based biofuels – such as soy and oil palm – wipe out their claimed climate benefits, driving forest loss, food insecurity, and land and water grabbing as agriculture is displaced onto marginal or uncultivated land. Soy and oil palm-based biofuels can generate emissions even higher than fossil fuels.

“Biofuels are not a sustainable solution under any circumstances. In Latin America, the push for soy-based biofuels has accelerated deforestation and driven communities off their lands. If the IMO creates new demand for biofuels, it will unleash more emissions, more inequality, and more land grabbing” said Jana Uemura, Climate Campaigner at the Global Forest Coalition.

“Rejecting biofuels in the Net-Zero Framework means protecting the world’s remaining tropical forests – critical carbon sinks and biodiversity hotspots.” said Anggi Putra Prayoga, Forest Campaigner at Forest Watch Indonesia. “The climate crisis is already real. It is crucial to take a firm stance on adopting truly zero-emission energy sources, rather than biofuels that generate new emissions through deforestation.”

The example of Indonesia should be a warning to other countries. In Indonesia, the expansion of palm oil plantations for biofuel continues to drive deforestation – even within protected and conservation forests which are highly vulnerable to climate change. “The loss of forests not only worsens emissions but also endangers the lives and rights of Indigenous peoples who depend on forest resources,” added the Forest Campaigner.

To avoid these impacts, the IMO should make sure high-ILUC fuels are excluded in the Framework. Major national and industry frameworks, including the EU’s Maritime and Aviation policies, the UK SAF Mandate, and the International Civil Aviation Authority’s CORSIA scheme, already exclude or cap high-ILUC biofuels, or include ILUC emissions in the life cycle accounting. The IMO must not fall behind.

“We urge all IMO member governments to take a strong, united stance against the inclusion of biofuels in the Net-Zero Framework” said Pax Butchart, Biofuel Campaigner at Biofuelwatch, “the science is clear: crop-based and waste-derived biofuels cannot deliver real emissions reductions. Governments now have a historic opportunity to steer the shipping sector toward truly clean, zero-emission solutions that protect people and the planet.”

Equally, biofuels produced from waste and residues such as used cooking oil (UCO), have limited availability and scalability, and won’t be able to satisfy the demand of international shipping in the long run.

Recent research estimates that while used cooking oil (UCO) will be the cheapest pathway for compliance, its supply is highly constrained and largely already used in the transport sector. The global waste oil supply currently used for biofuels production could only meet about 5% of shipping’s energy demand, leaving the sector reliant on the next-cheapest compliance pathway, high-ILUC biofuels, with major sustainability risks. UCO and palm derivatives, such as palm oil mill effluent (POME) and palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD), have been associated with fraud, weak auditing and risk displacement from their current use, increasing the use of unsustainable palm oil elsewhere.

The IMO governments must now pursue truly sustainable alternatives, including improved energy efficiency, wind-assisted propulsion and reducing demand for maritime transport in international trade.",https://www.ajot.com/images/uploads/article/_large/Credits__Biofuelwatch.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 21:01:39.377171

By James Lightbourn — While there’s plenty of soul-searching underway among supporters of the world’s first proposed carbon tax, its one-year delay could ultimately lead to a more resilient decarbonization framework — and perhaps an acknowledgment that the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and, in turn, the United Nations (U.N.), might not be the right body to oversee such a measure.

To understand what happened, and where we go from here, we need to understand the rationale behind the American-led rebellion against the Net Zero Framework (NZF).

The reason behind the NZF outcome is simple: “money”.

U.S. messaging around its opposition to the NZF focused on the potential cost to American consumers. But that argument rang hollow — especially since recently announced U.S. tariffs and fees on Chinese-built ships will likely have a similar effect.

However, the U.S.’ more compelling oppositional argument runs deeper and reflects waning confidence in the U.N. Even though it is headquartered in New York, only 32% of Americans believe it does a good job. Those figures are even worse amongst Republicans, 70% of whom believe the U.S. should decrease its funding of the U.N.

This is where the paradox starts to emerge.

The U.N. has an annual operating budget of $3.7 billion. The U.S. is the largest contributor to the U.N. and was assessed to be responsible for 22% of the regular budget, or $820 million in 2025. The Trump administration’s 2026 budget request seeks to withhold that contribution entirely.

The IMO, through the Net Zero Framework, is estimated to raise as much as $10 billion a year through carbon levies on the global shipping industry.

There would, no doubt, be tensions between a cash-strapped parent organization – the U.N. – and a cash-rich subsidiary – the IMO. This raises legitimate questions as to whether financial pressures could arise to such a level that IMO will feel compelled to divert funds collected under the NZF to cover shortfalls in the U.N. ‘s operating budget.

The U.N.’s financial situation (and the U.S.’ reluctance to fund it) aside, there was also the thorny question as to how the IMO would prudently allocate funds to support the decarbonization of the shipping sector without being heavy-handed in picking winners and losers amongst shipowners and fuel technologies.

With the NZF vote delayed, what is going to happen next?

NZF supporters often argue that a global industry needs global regulation, and that without it we’ll face a patchwork of regional rules.

But is that really such a bad outcome?

The European Union — one of the NZF’s biggest proponents — has already gone its own way, adding shipping to the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) and launching FuelEU Maritime. Brussels said that it would revisit those programs if the NZF passed, but never said exactly how. With the global plan now on hold, the EU framework remains intact. Similarly, African nations, led by Djibouti, have launched the African Sovereign Carbon Registry to collect fees from shipping companies based on their greenhouse gas emissions while calling their ports.

Other nations and regions are likely to follow suit. Yes, compliance will get more complex — but shipping companies already navigate a web of local regulations every time they arrive in port. Adding emissions requirements to that list won’t grind global trade to a halt.

Localized frameworks also ensure that the funds collected stay closer to the people and places most affected. Governments can decide how carbon revenues influence their own economies, export competitiveness, and consumer prices. And they can move faster — without waiting for consensus from 175 IMO member states.

We’re living in a fragmented, multipolar world. A fragmented, multipolar approach to decarbonization might actually fit it better.

Relying on a global institution struggling with governance, enforcement, and credibility might never have been a winning strategy.

A fragmented landscape of regional frameworks — from the EU’s ETS to whatever U.S., Asian, or Middle Eastern mechanisms emerge next — may actually prove more effective. Fragmentation allows nations to tailor policies to their own economic interests, move faster, and direct revenues toward local decarbonization rather than funneling billions into a centralized U.N. fund with limited oversight.

A decentralized, market-driven race to decarbonize — grounded in competition, instead of consensus — may be the most realistic solution in today’s geopolitical environment and, in turn, do more for the planet than a one-size-fits-all U.N. framework ever could hope to achieve.",https://gcaptain.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/shutterstock_142906477.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 16:16:27.468622

Some participants are feeling relief while many were disappointed and pointed to the near-term uncertainties that everyone hoped would have been resolved.

The working group, however, is going ahead to continue work on the guidelines for implementing the Net Zero Framework. They will be focusing on key issues related to greenhouse gas emissions as it works to develop consensus and clarifications on the architecture and implementation as well as the planned global fund. Further negotiations are expected on the carbon revenues as well as elements such as the use of biofuels and the supply of alternative fuels.

“The Framework’s success was always dependent on the development of strong and coherent implementation guidelines,” said Dr. Alison Shaw, IMO Policy Manager at the influential NGO T&E (European Federation for Transport and Environment). “This work can continue regardless of the delay.”

Jan Hoffmann, the Global Lead for Maritime Transport and Ports at the World Bank wrote in a social media posting that the delays were “sad news” and “a sad day for multilateralism.” He warned that it “extends uncertainty for the maritime industry, leading to delays in investments in ports and shipping capacity, which will ultimately also mean higher and more volatile freight rates.”

Some parts, however, also expressed their frustration and anger at the members and the IMO. The Ambassador of the Republic of the Marshall Islands who is the Marshall Islands Special Envoy for Maritime Decarbonization, Albon Ishoda, wrote, “Don’t pretend that the Pacific was voiceless; we were ignored, bullied, threatened, cornered, sidelined and harassed…. A year delay is a year of more devastation and displacement for our communities that have nothing to do with this catastrophe. We don’t have the luxury of time. The IMO owe our people an explanation!”

The industry has begun to comprehend the delay while still standing behind the IMO. “Global regulation is essential to ensure a level playing field at international level and to deliver the energy transition of international shipping. We will continue to work with our international partners to ensure an agreement on the IMO NZF can be reached,” said Sotiris Raptis, Secretary General of European Shipowners (ECSA).

The World Shipping Council also asserted that the IMO remains the right place to deliver a global solution. It wrote on Friday after the vote that it is committed to continuing to work with the government to deliver the necessary regulatory consistent for the industry.

The World Shipping Council is urging the IMO to use the time to close the remaining gaps in the agreement. INTERCARGO also reaffirmed its support for the IMO as the sole global regulator capable of delivering coherent and effective measures for international shipping. Similarly, the International Transport Workers’ Federation issue a statement calling for the governments to use the time to rebuild trust and reach agreement on a fair and practical path to decarbonizing shipping.

Many shipping companies have already said they will stay the course with their current efforts, while some owners of older ships are feeling a sense of temporary relief.",https://maritime-executive.com/media/images/article/IMO-MPEC-Session-Oct-2025.9ac2d9.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 14:56:08.258853
