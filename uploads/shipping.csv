By 2025, the European Union’s Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) is projected to add over $6 billion to global shipping costs.
By the end of the decade, a combination of regional and global price mechanisms could escalate this figure to over $50 billion annually, as estimated by Siglar Carbon, a shipping emissions analytics firm.

By 2025, the European Union’s Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) is projected to add over $6 billion to global shipping costs. By the end of the decade, a combination of regional and global price mechanisms could escalate this figure to over $50 billion annually, as estimated by Siglar Carbon, a shipping emissions analytics firm.

This financial burden reflects overlapping initiatives such as the EU ETS, the UK’s emissions trading scheme, FuelEU Maritime, and the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) forthcoming Greenhouse Gas Fuel Intensity (GFI) measure, which is scheduled to be implemented in 2028. Siglar suggests that if these schemes operate together and more countries adopt similar local taxes, shipping’s total annual carbon costs could approach $100 billion by 2030.

According to LSEG Research, European carbon prices may surge to $150 per tonne of CO₂ by 2030, further increasing the financial pressure on operators reliant on traditional fuels. Siglar analysts note that when carbon is priced, it significantly alters various dimensions of shipping operations—from chartering practices to financing. Emissions now carry a measurable commercial value affecting every voyage.

The IMO’s GFI will add a global carbon regulation across international shipping. When implemented, it could create compliance costs amounting to $22 billion in its initial years, rising potentially to $33 billion shortly thereafter. There remains uncertainty among regulators and industry stakeholders about whether the IMO’s framework will replace or coexist with regional schemes. If it merely adds another layer to existing regulations, the shipping sector may confront a fragmented, complex carbon regime that could disadvantage certain trades more than others.

For shipowners and operators, carbon pricing has transcended its role as an environmental metric; it has become a critical commercial variable that influences time charter equivalent (TCE) returns, voyage planning, and contract negotiations. Additionally, financial institutions and insurers are beginning to view carbon exposure as an emergent category of operational and credit risk. This new risk component must be scrutinized and priced with the same rigor applied to freight volatility and fuel costs, signaling a fundamental shift in how the shipping industry manages its economic and environmental responsibilities.",https://cdn-kdmmj.nitrocdn.com/rMIbIrPSYFfiGCokvtkImuATKIjcDThC/assets/images/optimized/rev-41bbbe8/maritimefairtrade.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/cropped-maritime-fairtrade-favicon-1-32x32.png,N,,2025-11-21 04:56:08.928087

Regular maintenance and monitoring are crucial to prevent equipment failures and ensure the integrity of the capture and storage systems.","The Global Centre for Maritime Decarbonisation (GCMD), AIM Horizon Investments and their partners on Thursday (20 November) announced the successful closing of the Fund for Energy Efficiency Technologies (FEET), securing total commitments of up to USD 35M, exceeding its initial target.

As the world’s first fund for vessel retrofits leveraging a pay-as-you-save repayment mechanism, FEET directly addresses the long-standing financial barriers hindering the sector’s uptake of vessel retrofits.

This fund has drawn strong interest from across the maritime value chain, including equipment manufacturers, shipowners, and investors. GCMD provides catalytic equity and is FEET’s appointed decarbonisation advisor.

FEET is managed by AIM Horizon Investments. Formerly known as FPG AIM Capital, AIM Horizon Investments is a Singapore-based fund manager specialising in maritime and aviation funds for institutional and accredited investors.

Shareholders of AIM Horizon Investments hold the fund’s commercial equity position, while the Development Bank of Japan Inc. (DBJ) holds the preferred equity position. DBS Bank and ING (which acted as Coordinating Bank) have in principle agreed to provide senior debt financing.

Improving energy efficiency remains one of the most effective strategies to reduce emissions and fuel costs. Energy Efficiency Technologies (EETs), such as wind-assisted propulsion systems (WAPS) and air lubrication systems (ALS), can deliver immediate fuel savings, assisting shipowners to stay competitive amid tightening regional carbon regulations. However, even with a retrofit market valued at over USD 20B, uncertainties around EET performance and access to financing continue to limit uptake.

A primary difficulty restricting adoption is the inherently variable fuel savings from EET retrofits, which depend on operational and environmental factors, such as routing and weather conditions. The lack of standardised methodologies to accurately measure fuel savings further challenges uptake.

This uncertainty has made the return on investment period difficult to predict and has exacerbated the split-incentive issue, where shipowners are expected to invest in retrofits whereas charterers realise savings.

A pay-as-you-save repayment mechanism addresses payback uncertainty with EETs by directly linking repayment to quantified and verified fuel and regulatory savings. Deploying this mechanism requires robust data collection and analysis to isolate the retrofit’s contribution to overall fuel savings.

To this end, GCMD has undertaken EET performance pilots, equipping vessels with additional sensors to acquire high-precision, high-resolution data and applying rigorous data analytics to quantify fuel savings with statistical confidence. As more data is collected across diverse operating and environmental conditions, these datasets can be used to model and predict savings under varying scenarios.

FEET is designed to scale beyond this initial closing, recognising the vast market size and shipping sector’s pressing decarbonisation needs. GCMD and AIM Horizon Investments are targeting to scale the fund to USD 500 million by 2030, capable of supporting around 200 ships.

Professor Lynn Loo, CEO, GCMD, said, “Bringing FEET to life has taken persistence and a willingness from everyone involved to step into the unknown. There was no playbook; our teams were learning as we went. This is exactly the kind of collaborative, problem-solving mindset needed to move the needle on maritime decarbonisation.”

“My hope is that FEET will accelerate the uptake of shipboard energy efficiency solutions and help unlock the scale of action needed to turn the industry’s decarbonisation ambition into tangible progress.”

The Maritime Technologies Forum (MTF) on Friday (14 November) announced the publication of guidelines for conducting qualitative risk assessments for alternative-fuelled ships: HAZID and HAZOP.

The use of alternative fuels will be key to addressing the ‘2023 IMO Strategy on Reduction of GHG Emissions from Ships.’

“While IMO has developed guidelines for design and operation of ships capable of using them, the Alternative Design and Approval process is required for most alternative fuels until mandatory regulations are in place,” MTF said in a statement.

“And this dictates using qualitative risk assessment to document an equivalent level of safety compared with a vessel designed to operate with conventional fuels.”

Existing guidelines, such as MSC.1/Circ.1455 and IACS Rec. 146, remain valuable references to the general process for handling alternative design, independent of technology. With the industry’s expanding adoption of alternative fuels and lessons learned from recent projects, MTF considered that there is a need to make supplement to these documents to cover a wider range of fuels and technologies.

The new MTF report provides guidelines for conducting qualitative risk assessments as a core component of the approval process for alternative-fuelled ships. This addresses both HAZID and HAZOP studies, detailing qualification requirements for involved personnel and outlining the procedural steps involved.

The guidelines also specify required input documents, reporting requirements and risk criteria. The guidelines support the identification of potential hazardous events and the development of preventive and mitigative safeguards to manage risks associated with the use of alternative fuels.

The new guidelines were presented at the MTF Seminar on Safe Maritime Decarbonisation held during Europort on 6 November 2025.

With the expected increase in alternative fuelled vessels, both newbuilds and retrofits, panel discussions with industry leaders focused on the relevance of the guidelines and their effective implementation to ensure consistent outcomes providing transparency and trust to the industry stakeholders.

John McDonald, ABS President and Chief Operating Officer, said: “As the industry scales up the use of new fuels, it’s essential to establish consistent and rigorous approaches to HAZIDs and HAZOPs. A unified framework is critical for maintaining safety equivalence as the industry adopts alternative fuel technologies.”

Alf Tore Sørheim, acting Director General, Norwegian Maritime Authority, said: “Consistency across methodologies will also help Administrations take decisions with more confidence. These guidelines are an important contribution, supporting Administrations and industry stakeholders in demonstrating safety for novel fuel systems through an alternative design process, in a more consistent and predictable manner.”

In a large-scale programme involving 50 different shipowners, A.P. Moller – Maersk (Maersk) on Thursday (2 October) said it is – in close collaboration with the owners – retrofitting around 200 vessels in its time-chartered fleet.

The main aim of the programme is to reduce the slot cost by improving fuel efficiency and cargo-carrying capacity leading to a decrease in both cost and greenhouse gas emissions.

Maersk has set the target of a 35% absolute reduction in its scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to the 2022 baseline year.

In total, Maersk and time-charter partners have executed more than 1,500 individual projects across 200 vessels with 50 shipowners, and an additional 1,000 projects are in the process of execution scheduled to be finalised by 2027. The investment cost for these solutions is split between Maersk and the vessel owners.

Given the scale of the project, it spans very different vessels in terms of size and configurations, also meaning that the retrofit tools being used vary.

Of the around 200 vessels being retrofitted, a common and significant change to the vessel configuration is the replacement of the propeller or bulbous bow. The integration of an optimally designed bulbous bow reshapes water flow around the hull to reduce drag and enhance hydrodynamic efficiency – ultimately lowering fuel consumption. Alongside this, the replacement of propellers combined with Pre-Swirl Devices plays a crucial role in maximising thrust while minimising energy loss.

Other retrofit solutions such as auxiliary engine waste heat recovery systems allow steam production from auxiliary engine heat, reducing the reliance on fuel-oil-fired boilers. Similarly, the installation of shaft generator systems cuts down auxiliary engine usage, contributing to significant fuel savings.

Cargo-carrying capacity is also being enhanced through a range of structural and technical improvements: elevating the wheelhouse to improve line of sight and increase intake, raising the lashing bridges, strengthening the vessel’s deadweight capacity for deeper drafts, and upgrading both lashing systems and loading computer functionalities.

Ahmed Hassan, Head of Asset Strategy and Strategic Partnerships at Maersk, said: “Our medium- and long-term chartered fleet makes up a significant proportion of our operations as well as of our total fuel consumption. By working closely with our partners, we aim to implement solutions that not only reduce emissions but also enhance the overall competitiveness of our fleet.”

“While fuel transition is needed to reach our long-term goal of net-zero emissions by 2040, investments in existing fleet efficiency enhancement technologies is a powerful tool to gain significant emissions reductions in the short term. Consequently, this strong emphasis on efficiency measures can deliver tangible progress towards our 2030 goal. That goes for owned as well as chartered vessels.”

As the maritime industry shifts towards low-GHG fuels, ensuring safety during this transition is paramount. This article by classification society DNV highlights the critical measures and considerations necessary for a safe and effective switch to low-carbon fuels and technologies:

Orderbooks are increasingly filled with LNG and methanol fuelled vessels as well as first ammonia ones, as shipowners respond to current emissions regulations and aim to lower carbon intensity in the near term. However, with the IMO targeting net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, both LNG and methanol derived from fossil sources are expected to serve primarily as transitional fuels, requiring a further shift to low or zero GHG alternatives.

Preparing for future fuel switches and their risks

To support this transition, it is essential that considerations for future fuel flexibility are embedded from the design and newbuilding phase. This includes ensuring sufficient space and structural integration for alternative fuel systems, selecting materials compatible with a range of fuels to the extent possible, and designing fuel storage and supply systems that can be retrofitted with minimal disruption. Conducting high-level risk assessments early in the design phase can be an effective strategy to avoid potentially costly design changes later, depending on the extent of re-arrangement required.

Risk mitigation measures for liquefied gases such as hydrogen and ammonia typically include physical barriers between fuel storage, processing, and pumping equipment, and, to the extent possible, maintaining a distance from crew accommodation and workspaces. Detection systems for hazards such as gas leakages and fire are crucial safeguards to implement in relevant locations, enabling early warnings and the initiation of mitigating measures in case of occurrence. A practical and appropriate level of personal protective equipment (PPE) should be mandatory in hazardous areas.

Biofuels: Immediate alternatives with specific risks

From a safety and design perspective, enabling a future switch from conventional fossil fuels to biofuel involves practical and operational risks that need to be addressed to ensure compatibility of fuel systems with varying purity levels or slight differences in properties resulting from various production processes. Certain biofuels have a shorter shelf life compared to conventional marine fuels, which necessitates careful storage and handling considerations. For some biofuels there may be a need for additional training of crew with regard to handling.

Switching safely from LNG

While LNG addresses today’s challenges, the successful adoption of next-generation fuels depends on proactive planning and a design approach that anticipates both safety and regulatory demands. As the industry looks towards fuels such as ammonia, hydrogen, and green methanol, safety must remain a top priority due to their unique risk profiles – ammonia’s toxicity, hydrogen’s flammability and dispersion behaviour as well as its properties in both liquefied and compressed state, and methanol’s low flash point and near-invisible flame. Hydrogen is prone to leakage and can cause severe explosions when escaping. When stored in liquid form at ultra low temperature of -253°C, it requires sophisticated vacuum-insulated pressure tanks that must meet even stricter requirements than LNG tanks. Interaction of liquefied hydrogen with air or other gases harbours additional safety risks that must be considered in the design of storage and processing systems. As an alternative to liquid storage, hydrogen may be stored in compressed form at very high pressure; here again, the containment system must meet strict requirements to reduce the likelihood of leakage.

Liquefied ammonia leakages may damage ship structures due to low-temperature embrittlement, likewise requiring suitable material choices for tanks, processing systems and their surroundings. Ammonia is also highly corrosive to certain types of commonly used construction materials, which has to be accounted for in material selection. The focus of the ship design should be on minimizing and mitigating ammonia releases.

Ensuring safe and prepared fuel transitions

Comprehensive risk assessments should be initiated early to guide technical decisions and ensure safe operations. These may include qualitative assessments like Hazard Identification (HAZID), Hazard and Operability studies (HAZOP), Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA), as well as quantitative studies like Quantitative Risk Assessment (QRA), Gas Dispersion Analysis (GDA) or Explosion Risk Analysis (ERA). It is also imperative that the organizations deciding to utilize alternative fuels evolve in parallel with the technical development, ensuring that aspects concerning crew training, operational procedures, and emergency preparedness all are ready to take on the transition to new fuels.

Switching from methanol

Methanol offers a relatively flexible platform for future fuel transition because it does not require cryogenic storage and can be handled with simpler infrastructure compared to LNG or hydrogen. Ships designed for conventional methanol from fossil sources can, with minimal technical modification, switch to green or blue methanol.

While retrofitting for green or blue methanol would not typically require major structural or system changes, continued compliance with evolving safety standards, emissions reporting, and certification frameworks must be factored in during the design phase.

Looking beyond methanol, a switch to even lower-emission fuels such as ammonia or hydrogen is technically more complex and would generally require significant redesigning of fuel storage, supply systems, and safety measures. These fuels come with different physical properties and risk profiles, demanding tailored containment, ventilation, and fire suppression systems.

Available interim guidelines for ships using alternative fuels (methanol, ammonia and hydrogen (draft)) are all based on the safety principles of the IGF code (International Code of Safety for Ship Using Gases or Other Low-flashpoint Fuels) as a starting point. Until comprehensive statutory regulations are in place, an alternative design assessment for any alternative fuel project is essential. The IMO’s risk-based alternative design (ADA) process (MSC.1/Circ.1455) provides a basis for individual approvals.

Safe installation of onboard carbon capture and storage (OCCS)

Carbon dioxide (CO2) captured from the exhaust gas stream using chemical solvents is purified and compressed for onboard storage. While CO2 is classified as a dangerous good by the IMDG Code and has recently been classified as toxic by IMO, its risks can be effectively managed with proper safety measures. CO2 displaces oxygen in the air, posing a risk of asphyxiation or intoxication, which must be mitigated through adequate ventilation and monitoring systems. The solvents and refrigerants used in the liquefaction and storage of compressed CO2 also require careful handling. However, with relevant training, PPE and safety protocols, these risks can be minimized.

The installation of onboard carbon capture systems must adhere to strict guidelines covering exhaust pre-treatment, absorption processes, liquefaction, storage, and transfer systems. Regular maintenance and monitoring are crucial to prevent equipment failures and ensure the integrity of the capture and storage systems. Comprehensive crew training on the operation and emergency procedures related to OCC systems is essential to enhance safety and preparedness. These measures, combined with continuous regulatory updates and adherence to international safety standards, are vital for the successful deployment of onboard carbon capture technologies.

IMO plans to incorporate the application of onboard carbon capture in the IMO Lifecycle Assessment (LCA) Guidelines. DNV has published guidelines for the safe installation of onboard carbon capture, as well as comprehensive storage and classification rules, and offers its OCCS and OCCS Ready class notations. Flag state administrations have the final say on accepting these guidelines and may impose additional requirements for safe implementation on board.

The momentum for this important decision is building: the Nordic Council of Ministers has just made a recommendation for the Nordic governments to work towards the recognition of polar fuels by the IMO and the MARPOL Convention.

“The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has spent more than a decade on scientific analysis and discussions, but black carbon emissions from Arctic shipping remain unregulated”, said Sigurd Enge, Senior Advisor, Shipping at Bellona, a member of the Clean Arctic Alliance. “Now Arctic nations, including Norway, need to act without further delay, to make cleaner fuels (polar fuels) mandatory for shipping in this unique region that is already being affected by climate change. Norway has a unique opportunity to demonstrate joint leadership on this issue, as it has many vessels operating in polar waters.”

“Black carbon is one of the longest, unresolved issues running at the IMO, and must now be dealt with without delay”, said Dr Sian Prior, Lead Advisor, of the Clean Arctic Alliance. “The next opportunity comes in February 2026, when the IMO’s Sub-Committee on Pollution Prevention and Response will meet (PPR 13) to discuss polar fuels.”

“A strong agreement on polar fuels to set rules which will reduce black carbon emission levels from shipping in the Arctic region is essential”, added Prior. “The deadline for submitting proposals is December 5th – and we want to see a concrete proposal led by Arctic states on polar fuels that will ensure a rapid reduction in Arctic black carbon emissions, ahead of longer-term decarbonisation efforts.”

A regulation requiring the use of polar fuels in the Arctic must set the foundation in MARPOL Annex VI (International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships) for reductions in emissions which reduce the impact of black carbon on the Arctic.

“Norway has been a leader in the past on action to reduce atmospheric emissions from shipping leading to improvements in air quality both domestically in Norway’s fjords, and in the Norwegian Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) through an emission control area for the Norwegian sea which takes effect in 2026”, said Enge. A PPR 13 submission, supported by Norway, would showcase Norwegian leadership, place Norway at the centre of mitigating climate impacts from black carbon emissions from shipping across the whole Arctic, and set the global shipping community on the right pathway”.

A recent report by NGO Pacific Environment lays out the case for why the International Maritime Organization (IMO) should immediately act on reducing black carbon pollution — a climate super-pollutant. On Thin Ice: Why Black Carbon Demands Urgent Action, explores how the expansion of Arctic shipping is causing an increase in the release of black carbon into the air, which then settles on snow and ice, accelerating dangerous melting.

From the report: “one major cause of the accelerated Arctic warming is black carbon, a super-pollutant characterized mainly by its high degree of warming potential as a powerful “short-lived climate forcer” — small particles with a relatively brief lifespan in the atmosphere compared to long- lived greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide (CO2). Cutting black carbon emissions will result in immediate climate benefits that slow warming in the Arctic and improve public health”.

Despite over a decade of scientific analysis and discussions at the International Maritime Organization (IMO), black carbon emissions from Arctic shipping remain unregulated, with only non-binding guidance in place. On thin ice: Why black carbon demands urgent action, presents a clear and urgent call for IMO member states to require vessels operating in and near the Arctic to switch to readily available and cleaner “polar fuels” — such as marine distillates DMA and DMZ or new fuels with comparable black carbon emissions levels — to rapidly cut emissions, protect vulnerable ecosystems and safeguard communities.",https://cyprusshippingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Clean-Arctic-Alliance-Logo-New.jpg,N,,2025-11-20 22:56:30.722852

The world’s oceans, covering over 70% of Earth’s surface, are central to climate regulation. They absorb nearly 25% of anthropogenic CO₂ and over 90% of excess heat, acting as planetary thermostats.

Yet, oceans remain underrepresented in climate policy, receiving less than 1% of global climate finance. As climate risks intensify, sea-level rise, marine heatwaves, and declining fish stocks, global attention has shifted towards ocean-based climate action as a core pillar of sustainable development.

At COP30, a powerful shift in global climate diplomacy emerged as 17 nations, including France, Brazil, Belgium, Canada, Indonesia, and Singapore, joined the Blue NDC Challenge, committing to embed ocean-based climate solutions into their national climate pledges. The move signals recognition of a long-ignored truth: without integrating oceans, the world cannot meet the 1.5°C climate target.

Ocean-Based Climate Action: Why it matters?

Carbon Sequestration

Blue carbon ecosystems, mangroves, seagrass meadows, and salt marshes store carbon at rates far higher than terrestrial forests.

Restoring blue carbon ecosystems can reduce emissions while protecting coastlines.

Heat and Weather Regulation

Oceans absorb the majority of excess heat, moderating the temperature rise.

Ocean warming, however, worsens cyclones, coral bleaching, and biodiversity loss.

Livelihoods and Economy

3 billion people depend on marine and coastal ecosystems for livelihoods.

Fisheries, shipping, and coastal tourism are vulnerable to climate shocks.

Key Components of Ocean-Based Climate Action

Blue Carbon Ecosystems

Conservation and restoration of mangroves, seagrasses, and salt marshes.

These ecosystems provide carbon sinks, storm protection, and biodiversity support.

Countries are now incorporating them into their NDCs.

Sustainable Ocean Food Systems

Climate-resilient fisheries and aquaculture.

Reducing overfishing and shifting to low-carbon aquaculture models.

Offshore Renewable Energy

Oceans hold immense potential for:

Offshore wind energy

Tidal and wave power

Offshore wind alone can contribute significantly to global net-zero pathways.

Decarbonising Global Shipping

Shipping accounts for ~3% of global CO₂ emissions.

IMO is pushing for:

Zero-emission fuels (green hydrogen, ammonia)

Energy-efficient vessels

Carbon intensity reduction measures

Coastal and Marine Conservation

Expanding Marine Protected Areas (MPAs).

Protecting coral reefs, hotspots, and migratory species.

Reducing marine pollution-plastics, chemicals, and oil spills.

Nature-Based Coastal Adaptation

Mangroves and reefs act as natural barriers against erosion and storm surges.

Essential for climate-risk mitigation in vulnerable coastal regions.

What is the Blue NDC Challenge?

The Blue NDC Challenge is a global initiative encouraging countries to include ocean-based mitigation and adaptation strategies in their Paris Agreement commitments.

It addresses the “ocean opportunity gap”, the disconnect between oceans’ climate potential and their limited representation in global climate policy.

Objectives:

Mainstream marine conservation and blue carbon ecosystems into national climate plans

Accelerate offshore renewables and decarbonise shipping

Build coastal resilience through science-based adaptation strategies

Mobilise global finance for marine-based solutions

It is supported by a coalition led by France and Brazil, reflecting their growing leadership in ocean diplomacy.

Key Features of the Initiative

Expanded Global Coalition

Seventeen countries now participate, with new members including:

Belgium

Canada

Indonesia

Singapore

This cross-continental participation strengthens political momentum for ocean-centric climate action.

Creation of an Ocean Taskforce

This taskforce, anchored by France and Brazil-helps countries integrate ocean solutions into their updated 2030 NDCs, especially ahead of the next NDC cycle due in 2025-26.

The “Blue Package”

A coordinated blueprint covering five ocean breakthrough sectors:

Marine Conservation & Restoration

Ocean Food Systems (sustainable fisheries, aquaculture)

Offshore Renewable Energy (wind, tidal, wave)

Shipping Decarbonisation

Coastal & Marine Tourism

This expands climate planning beyond land-based actions.

Mitigation & Adaptation Priority

Oceans could deliver up to 35% of the global emissions reductions needed for the 1.5°C pathway. The initiative emphasises:

mangrove and seagrass restoration,

blue carbon mapping,

coastal ecosystem protection,

clean shipping corridors

early-warning systems for coastal hazards.

Closing the Climate Finance Gap

With less than 1% of global climate finance flowing to ocean-based solutions, the initiative aims to:

create blue finance frameworks,

boost multilateral funding,

mobilise private capital for blue-economy projects, and

support small island and coastal nations vulnerable to sea-level rise.

Blue Carbon Pathways

Blue carbon ecosystems, mangroves, seagrasses, and salt marshes are among the most efficient carbon sinks on Earth. Many participating nations plan to include:

national blue carbon inventories,

carbon credit mechanisms,

marine protected area (MPA) expansion.

International Frameworks

UN Ocean Decade (2021-2030)

High Ambition Coalition for Nature and People

Global Biodiversity Framework (30×30)

These frameworks promote integrated land–sea climate planning.

Challenges

Poor Governance & Fragmented Policy: Land-based ministries, fisheries, and environment departments often work in silos.

Underfunding: Ocean climate finance is <1% of global climate finance, despite huge mitigation potential.

Vulnerability to Climate Extremes: Marine heatwaves, acidification, coral bleaching are escalating.

Technological & Data Gaps: Limited monitoring, data, and modelling of marine ecosystems.

This delay comes after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened sanctions against countries supporting the plan, marking a significant setback for global climate action. The postponement was narrowly decided by a vote of 57-49 and reflects the U.S.’s withdrawal from IMO negotiations earlier in April, where it denounced the carbon tax as a “scam.”

The Philippines is particularly vulnerable to the consequences of this decision, given its substantial reliance on a maritime workforce that includes many Filipino seafarers.

This framework aimed to push shipping companies to gradually decrease their carbon emissions starting in 2028, with financial penalties for non-compliance. The funds generated were intended to support low-emission ships and assist climate-vulnerable countries like the Philippines in adapting to challenges posed by rising sea levels and extreme weather events.

Shipping is responsible for about 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions. The proposal had garnered backing from numerous countries advocating for climate action, such as the European Union, China, Brazil, and various Pacific Island nations. However, strong opposition emerged from oil-producing countries like Saudi Arabia, Russia, and the United Arab Emirates. These nations argued that the carbon measure would threaten food security and economic growth. Argentina also shifted from an abstention stance to outright opposition in the latest discussions.

By Michael Ethan Gold

The ships that keep global trade afloat face a complex path toward decarbonization. Accounting for roughly 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions, the maritime sector needs a bold strategy to reach net zero – a reality that the International Maritime Organization (IMO) appeared set to acknowledge with the introduction of a carbon pricing framework, the first-ever for the sector. As a vote to approve the framework inched closer last month, climate advocates were cautiously optimistic that it would set a new milestone for the industry.

They did not account for intervention of the climate-denying Trump administration.

Under intense lobbying, pressure and threats from US officials, delegates to the IMO ultimately delayed the carbon price decision by a year. The vote, 57 to 49, followed what diplomats described as an unprecedented campaign of bullying tactics by the Trump administration. According to a New York Times investigation, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio personally called officials in small and developing countries, threatening tariffs, visa bans and sanctions if they supported the measure.

For the maritime community gathered in Barcelona at the Tomorrow.Blue Economy World Congress in early November, the reaction was one of shock and frustration, mixed with determination to press ahead nonetheless.

“It came to a screeching halt,” said Stewart Sarkozy-Banoczy, CEO of the World Ocean Council, whose members include major shipping lines and port authorities. “We’re disappointed, but cities, ports and corporations now have to step in. We’ve seen this before, when the US walked out of the Paris Agreement. Subnational actors kept the work going.”

That subnational momentum, from ports, cities and coastal states, has become a lifeline for maritime climate progress, according to Allyson Browne, CEO of the High Ambition Climate Collective.

“The US is not a monolith,” Browne told Earth.Org in Barcelona. “Individual ports are still pushing ahead. The real work is happening on the ground.”

Browne emphasized, however, that local initiatives cannot replace an international framework. “Shipping is inherently international,” she said. “Without standardized rules and a collective fund for a just and equitable transition, we’ll get a patchwork of policies that makes it harder for developing nations to keep up.”

The tension between global ambition and fractured national politics has long defined shipping’s struggle to decarbonize. London-based IMO is a UN agency founded in 1948 to improve maritime safety after the Titanic disaster. It began addressing climate change in the 2010s, with a set of mandatory measures to improve energy efficiency. While a 2018 commitment to cut shipping’s emissions by at least 50% by 2050 earned plaudits, it was only with the proposed carbon price that the body made concrete moves toward decarbonization.

Under the plan, ships would pay fees as high as $380 per tonne of CO2 equivalent for emissions above set thresholds, with the revenues supporting green innovation and climate adaptation in Small Island and Developing States.

It had the makings of “excellent regulation,” Tristan Smith, Professor at University College London focused on the decarbonization of international shipping, said on the Cleaning Up podcast. Smith called the US pressure campaign “an appalling deployment of pressure” and believes the move reflected a gross distortion of the normal rules of international diplomacy, to the extent that long-held principles became all but meaningless. “It felt apocalyptic,” he said.

Panelists at the Barcelona summit agreed that while the delay was political, it should not derail progress. Hector Calls, Director of Environmental Sustainability and Energy Transition at the Port of Barcelona, called it “disappointing, but not a stop. We’ll keep the course, because clarity and regulation are good for the sector.”

Patrik Benrick, Head of Strategic Development and Innovation at the Port of Gothenburg, echoed Calls’s sentiment: “Better to postpone and keep working than to get a rejection. The risk is that others lose courage, so the EU must stay firm and show leadership.”

Despite the setback, green shipping remains a growing trend. Global shipping giant Maersk sails methanol-powered vessels, and several ports, from Los Angeles to Singapore, are building green corridors to support zero-emission trade routes. Browne said such examples can help build the confidence of member states to resist continued US pressure ahead of next year’s postponed vote. Whether that will be enough to garner majority support remains uncertain, but for many in the maritime community, retreat is not an option.

“We know what our goals are and we need to meet them,” said Sarkozy-Banoczy. “Ports and shipping lines are moving towards greener fuels. I’m hopeful that’s the direction.”

…said Ingvar M. Mathisen, Port Director of Oslo.

By 2030, the city aims to cut emissions by 95%, and Oslo Port by 85%, to become emission-free. Oslo Port is working systematically to become a zero-emission port. Since 2018, NOK 225 million has been invested in zero-emission infrastructure, reducing emissions from port activities by 26%.

Shore power has been installed for cruise ships, international ferries, bulk carriers, and container ships. A new facility for cruise ships will open at Filipstad in 2026, and shore power for tankers is under planning. Fast-charging stations for heavy vehicles have been established at Grønlia and Revierkaia.

“We are changing previous discounts for scheduled traffic to reward ships that cut emissions. Cargo ships using shore power will receive a 20% discount. The goal is to promote environmentally friendly sea transport,” commented Commercial Director Einar Marthinussen.

Shore power and electric ferries have delivered good results, but more measures are needed to reach the targets. The next steps include alternative fuels, green transport corridors, and improved charging infrastructure.

Secretary-General António Guterres lambasted world leaders for failing to keep global warming below 1.5°C. Coming in the wake of the failure of delegates at the International Maritime Organisation’s to vote to adopt landmark regulations to drastically cut emissions, the omens were not auspicious.

These would have made shipping the first sector with binding global emissions targets. After ten years’ of negotiations, the IMO had agreed in April an ambitious greenhouse gas reduction target of 8-21% by 2030 and 30-63% by 2035.

The IMO package included limits on the level of emissions per unit of energy and setting a global price for maritime carbon emissions. Shipping generates three per cent of global emissions.

Revenues were to be recycled back into the scheme to help fund zero- and near-zero-emission technologies, making transition costs fairer for poorer countries.

Without the scheme, shipping emissions could rise by as much as 50% by 2050.

However, in October, intense lobbying from Washington led to several nations, including China and Greece changing their stance. The Financial Times reported one IMO veteran describing the U.S. delegation as “behaving like gangsters,” disrupting proceedings and challenging the chair. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio later hailed the delay as a “huge win” for the Trump administration.

What It Means For Decarbonisation

For the IMO, and the environment, it’s a setback. But what does it mean to those in the shipping industry?

“Norway has been steaming ahead for years in the transition to lower emissions,” says Helene Tofte, director of the Norwegian Shipowners Association. Shipping accounts for 10 - 15 % of GDP in Norway.

She believes the immediate impact of the IMO delay in countries such as Norway will be very limited. Europe already has the tightest regional net zero shipping regulations and targets in the world, and Tofte expects EU countries will continue to fulfil them.

However, if the transition delay becomes prolonged, the implications could have a significant impact on shipping companies, creating uncertainty and higher costs.

As Tofte says, “We’ve been asking for one set of global regulations for many years, not just to have some certainty, but so that everybody will follow the same regulations. If more regional regulations come in instead, with one set in Europe, another in China and so on, it will make it much more difficult for the industry.”

Regional Momentum

Elsewhere, for innovative companies that have invested heavily in green technology, demand remains strong. Torbjörn Bäck, Group CEO of Swedish battery-systems provider Echandia, argues that the market will continue to surge ahead.

“The momentum toward more electrification in maritime remains strong, particularly in Europe and among forward-leaning governments, owners, naval architects, and operators,” he says.

“The market drivers are higher efficiency, better comfort and improved safety in many different areas of application. For example, fuel savings, the provision of heavy power levels for cranes and propulsion systems, back-up power and many more areas.”

“Regional leadership (for example Nordics, EU, India, Singapore, part of US) is already creating practical examples that others will be able to follow at the right time,” adds Bäck.

The drive towards greater efficiency - such as adding wind sails to the decks of cargo vessels or using AI to streamline operations - isn’t just about the environment after all. It’s about cost reduction.

Nevertheless, Lloyd’s List journalist Declan Bush argues the anticlimax ‘leaves shipping in the green purgatory to which it has become accustomed.’

The delay adds another layer of uncertainty: multiple regional standards are harder to navigate than one global rulebook.

More importantly, the IMO proposal’s real strength lay in its redistributive design—channelling revenues to poorer nations most vulnerable to problems caused by warming. In the Trump-led zeitgeist, is this achievable?

Tofte questions the nature of discussions and plans the leading members of the IMO will have before the next conference, at which the motion is likely to be re-presented. “How will they try to steer this process? It’s not just about what we would like to achieve but what is it possible to achieve, the way the world looks right now?”

According to a statement from WinGD, the delay in adopting the International Maritime Organization's Net Zero Framework (NZF) has made more operators consider LNG propulsion. Without a global carbon pricing policy and immediate e-fuel incentives, LNG remains the most affordable, widely available and well-established of all marine alternative fuels. The company stated that even fossil LNG can push vessels a long way towards the 30% reduction in emissions sought by 2030, which is an intermediate checkpoint under the IMO's GHG reduction strategy that remains in place despite the NZF vote postponement.

WinGD emphasized that the NZF does not mean the case for LNG fuel or for installing dual-fuel LNG technology is over. The company's X-DF dual-fuel LNG engines are ready to use zero or near-zero emissions fuels, specifically bio-methane and e-methane, which can be used without modification and in any blend.

The company reported that its X-DF concept has been in service since 2016, with more than 900 engines sold and over 8 million running hours of experience. WinGD stated it has continuously refined fuel consumption and emissions performance through innovations including iCER and VCR technology, reducing methane slip by 60% in less than a decade.

WinGD claims that X-DF outperforms current high-pressure LNG engines in total greenhouse gas emissions in several vessel applications and that low operational expenses and initial system costs mean total vessel lifecycle costs remain lower for X-DF than for high-pressure counterparts, regardless of IMO penalties.

The company noted that if the global framework were to fail, a patchwork of regional regulatory regimes would likely follow. In such scenarios, X-DF technology offers the best air pollution profile of any LNG dual-fuel engine, including advantages in SOx, NOx and particulate matter emissions that could translate to cost savings under pollution pricing schemes.

In 2025 alone, 80 companies went public with a pipeline of 300, whilst companies raised nearly $60b through IPOs, placements, convertibles, and exchangeable bond offerings.

“Shipping is the backbone of global trade, and decarbonisation is creating new markets for fuels, technologies, and services — all of which require capital,” Banga said. Hong Kong’s deep capital markets, record IPO activity, and strong green finance ecosystem make it uniquely placed to fund this transition.

The outlook had seemed contrastingly upbeat in the first half of the year, when at the International Maritime Organisation’s 83rd session in April, the Marine Environment Protection Committee proposed a world first net zero initiative, the IMO Framework, combining mandatory emissions limits and greenhouse gas emissions pricing in order to increase the uptake of green fuel technology and reach net zero GHG emissions by 2050.

Given that the shipping industry generates 3% of global GHG emissions, the news was promising, and had received support from many countries, as well as the International Chamber of Shipping. The IMO Framework was designed to operate through amendments to MARPOL Annex VI, the primary international convention regulating ship emissions. Without agreement on these amendments, the framework cannot be legally enforced, leaving the industry without a unified route to decarbonisation.

It was disappointing, then, that when the MEPC held its second extraordinary session in October, the parties could not reach consensus on the necessary enacting amendments to MARPOL Annex VI. Further negotiations were adjourned to October 2026, thus jeopardising the timeframe for decarbonisation. While the IMO Framework ultimately fell as a geopolitical pawn (with the US administration lobbying widely to ensure it was not adopted), concerns were also raised as to the potential compliance costs associated with its adoption and the viability of green fuels more generally.

The latter concern arises from the fact that no single green fuel has emerged as a frontrunner for global adoption. Indeed, each of the main contenders (ammonia, methanol, hydrogen, biofuels and liquefied natural gas) possesses inherent risks that have the potential to compromise environmental and human safety in the event of a disaster.

Unfortunately, the law does not yet have an answer as to how a catastrophe would be compensated; none of the oil pollution conventions deal with green fuels. Ratification of the International Convention on Liability and Compensation for Damage in Connection with the Carriage of Hazardous and Noxious Substances by Sea is, however, gaining momentum.

Despite the outcome, Australia remains focused on its Maritime Emissions Reduction National Action Plan, establishing a Green Shipping Corridor with Singapore by the end of 2025, and investigating other green corridors with South-East Asian neighbours. At a domestic level, TasPorts is working to position itself as a hydrogen production centre.

Likewise, major global shipping companies are taking it upon themselves to develop green technology and decarbonise the industry. The difficulty, of course, is that in the absence of a unified approach, they are left to dissect a multitude of regulations, regimes and reporting requirements as they traverse the world. It is, therefore, hoped that supporters of the IMO Framework can build consensus over the coming year in the hopes of a successful negotiation in October 2026.",https://www.cirmagazine.com/cir/images/BethSparkeH.PNG,N,,2025-11-20 09:56:33.645266

Maritime Energy Transition Accelerated In Hong Kong, China

Industry leaders gathered during Hong Kong Maritime Week for an IMO Future Fuels and Technology Project seminar (18 November) focused on accelerating the energy transition in global shipping.

The event brought together representatives from the shipping, port and energy sectors, alongside government officials and environmental NGOs, to explore how cross-sector collaboration can drive meaningful progress.

Central to the discussions was the role of Hong Kong, China in fostering sustainable and innovative global shipping, showcasing initiatives designed to advance the energy transition of shipping and highlighting the role of terminal operators at the port of Hong Kong.

Speakers emphasized the importance of regulation to make the transition a reality and discussed approaches to developing viable business cases for alternative fuels and the industry's drive to accelerate innovation. Speakers also highlighted the critical role of financial institutions in driving production to narrow the cost gap between emerging alternatives and conventional marine fuels and scaling up cleaner fuel solutions.

Keynote remarks were delivered by Mr. Liu Chun San, JP, Under Secretary for Transport and Logistics; H.E. Mr. Even Tronstad Sagebakken, State Secretary of the Norwegian Ministry of Trade, Industry and Fisheries; Mr. Angad Banga, Chairman of the Hong Kong Shipowners Association; and Mr. Roel Hoenders, Head of Climate Action and Clean Air at IMO.

Mr. Sveinung Oftedal, Chair of the IMO Working Group on Greenhouse Gas Emissions, delivered a presentation outlining IMO's global actions to advance zero and near-zero emission fuels and technologies.

The project's next technical seminar on biofuels will take place on 12 February 2026.

As stated, the momentum for this important decision is building as the Nordic Council of Ministers has just made a recommendation for the Nordic governments to work towards the recognition of polar fuels by the IMO and the MARPOL Convention.

The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has spent more than a decade on scientific analysis and discussions, but black carbon emissions from Arctic shipping remain unregulated. Now Arctic nations, including Norway, need to act without further delay, to make cleaner fuels (polar fuels) mandatory for shipping in this unique region that is already being affected by climate change.

…said Sigurd Enge, Senior Advisor, Shipping at Bellona, a member of the Clean Arctic Alliance, highlighting that Norway has a unique opportunity to demonstrate joint leadership on this issue, as it has many vessels operating in polar waters. Norway and Arctic States Should Drive the Shift to Cleaner Arctic Shipping Fuel

Furthermore, said Dr. Sian Prior, Lead Advisor, Clean Arctic Alliance, explained that black carbon is one of the longest, unresolved issues running at the IMO, and must now be dealt with without delay. The next opportunity comes in February 2026, when the IMO’s Sub-Committee on Pollution Prevention and Response will meet (PPR 13) to discuss polar fuels.

A strong agreement on polar fuels to set rules which will reduce black carbon emission levels from shipping in the Arctic region is essential. The deadline for submitting proposals is December 5th – and we want to see a concrete proposal led by Arctic states on polar fuels that will ensure a rapid reduction in Arctic black carbon emissions, ahead of longer-term decarbonisation efforts.

…added Prior.

A regulation requiring the use of polar fuels in the Arctic must set the foundation in MARPOL Annex VI (International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships) for reductions in emissions which reduce the impact of black carbon on the Arctic.

“Norway has been a leader in the past on action to reduce atmospheric emissions from shipping leading to improvements in air quality both domestically in Norway’s fjords, and in the Norwegian Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) through an emission control area for the Norwegian sea which takes effect in 2026”, said Enge.

With over 50 events organised by more than 70 international, Chinese Mainland and local organisers, HKMW 2025 has drawn a record of over 18,000 participants from around the globe. It provides a high-level platform for policymakers, senior representatives of international organisations as well as industrial luminaries and practitioners to share their perspectives and exchange views on various topics of interest to the global maritime industry.

Speaking at the opening ceremony (November 17), John Lee, Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), urged stronger international collaboration to overcome challenges and forge a more sustainable future for maritime industries.

“In a world being reshaped by geopolitical discord, technological disruption and climate change, these themes are more than aspirational. They sound an alarm, a wake-up call to collective action,” Mr Lee said. “Hong Kong’s role as a stable, reliable and dynamic maritime hub has never been more vital. The principle of ‘one country, two systems’ is the cornerstone of our success, providing us with an unshakeable foundation.”

Mr Lee also attended the opening of the two-day Asian Logistics, Maritime and Aviation Conference (ALMAC) (November 17-18), an anchor event of HKMW that welcomed some 2,300 high-profile logistics leaders and professionals from more than 40 countries and regions . During the event, he unveiled the first batch of ports under the newly established Partner Port network.

“I am particularly pleased to announce that Hong Kong has established Partner Port relationships with Guangxi port and Dalian port in the Chinese Mainland, and Port San Antonio in Chile,” Mr Lee said. “These ports are of strategic importance, and true to our character and policy priorities. As an international maritime centre, we connect the Chinese Mainland with the world and seek partners who support an open, international trade order.”

Echoing the theme of the HKMW 2025, the HKSAR Government’s Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Mable Chan, said green transformation is a major global trend in the maritime industry. To help meet the International Maritime Organization (IMO)’s target of achieving net-zero carbon emissions from international shipping by 2050, the government was bringing together all parties, including fuel suppliers and other IMO members to achieve this goal as a joint force.

In a media interview, Ms Chan outlined recent government initiatives to promote green shipping. These include announcing the Code of Practice on LNG Bunkering and Code of Practice on Methanol Bunkering, and launching the Green Maritime Fuel Bunkering Incentive Scheme to provide incentives to pioneer companies conducting green maritime fuel bunkering businesses in Hong Kong for relevant bunkering operations.

“The government facilitated the conduct of the first liquefied natural gas (LNG) ship-to-ship bunkering demonstration by the industry in February 2025. Since then, 13 commercial LNG bunkering operations have been successfully conducted, regularising the provision of commercial LNG bunkering services in Hong Kong,” Ms Chan said. “These demonstrate Hong Kong’s great potential in developing green maritime fuel bunkering.”

Paul Chan, Financial Secretary of the HKSAR Government, highlighted opportunities arising from decarbonisation. Speaking at the Hong Kong Global Maritime Trade Summit (November 17) themed “Building Resilience, Driving Growth and Investment”, Mr Chan said that maritime decarbonisation represents a “multi-trillion-dollar investment opportunity” through 2050.

“The transition to zero-emission marine fuels could create up to 4 million jobs globally across the energy supply chain,” he said. “Here in Hong Kong, we are embracing this. For example, we have published an Action Plan on Green Maritime Fuel Bunkering, positioning ourselves as a regional hub for sustainable fuel supply. Our goal is to provide bunkering services for green fuels to ocean-going vessels more than 60 times per year by 2030, involving over 200,000 tonnes of green maritime fuels.”

Hong Kong ranks fourth, globally, in the International Shipping Centre Development Index for six consecutive years and is home to more than 1,200 port and maritime-related companies, a thriving cluster of global leaders in ship management, finance, insurance and law.

To enhance the city’s leading position in high value-added maritime services, Mr Lee said Hong Kong would make good use of its “one country, two systems” advantages, including being China’s only bilingual common law jurisdiction as well as offering a simple and low tax regime, free port status and the unfettered flow of capital, information and talent.

Ms Chan said, “We will strengthen collaboration with international marine insurance organisations to upscale the training of marine insurance talents, whilst expanding the scope of the Maritime and Aviation Training Fund to cover more green energy courses, thereby reinforcing Hong Kong maritime strengths.”

By harnessing the power of AI, blockchain, cloud computing and other cutting-edge technologies, Hong Kong is developing a Port Community System, to be launched in January 2026. It will enable real-time cargo tracking and facilitate data exchange across transport modes, boosting trade and capital flows digitally, opening up new opportunities, from trade financing to more efficient customs declaration.

Just like our X-DF-A ammonia-fuelled and X-DF-M methanol-fuelled engines, our X-DF dual-fuel LNG engines are ready to use zero or near-zero emissions (ZNZ) fuels.
A pause in implementing the policy only pushes the transition from fossil LNG further down the road.
Combined with low fuel consumption, this means that X-DF outperforms current high-pressure LNG engines in total greenhouse gas emissions in several vessel applications.
Regardless, WinGD’s near decade of optimising the X-DF platform mean operators will pay less, whether they use fossil LNG or transition to cleaner variants.","Going into the extraordinary session of IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee in mid-October, many in the industry had high hopes that the Net-Zero Framework (NZF) would be adopted. Marine engine designer WinGD was and remains one of the believers; incentivising the production and uptake of clean fuels is the only way to meet both IMO emissions ambitions and wider global climate targets.

The NZF does not mean, as some have suggested, that the case for LNG fuel or for installing dual-fuel LNG technology is over. Just like our X-DF-A ammonia-fuelled and X-DF-M methanol-fuelled engines, our X-DF dual-fuel LNG engines are ready to use zero or near-zero emissions (ZNZ) fuels. In the case of LNG, those ZNZ fuels are bio-methane and e-methane, produced using captured carbon and renewable electricity, which can be used without modification and in any blend in X-DF engines.

“A pause only pushes the transition from fossil LNG further down the road”

Had the NZF been adopted with reduction targets and penalties stringent enough to drive people towards bio-methane, and rewards high enough to encourage e-methane production and use, the transition towards those fuels would have come sooner. A pause in implementing the policy only pushes the transition from fossil LNG further down the road.

That is why the NZF delay has made more operators consider LNG propulsion. Without a global carbon pricing policy and immediate e-fuel incentives, it remains the most affordable, widely available and well-established of all marine alternative fuels. Even fossil LNG can push vessels a long way towards the 30% reduction in emissions sought by 2030, an intermediate checkpoint under IMO’s GHG reduction strategy (which remains in place even after the NZF vote postponement).

WinGD’s X-DF concept has been in service since 2016, with more than 900 engines sold. Over that time, we have amassed more than eight million running hours of experience and continuously refined fuel consumption and emissions performance via innovations including iCER and VCR technology.

Advancing GHG benefits

Take methane slip as an example, in less than a decade we have reduced slippage by 60%, thanks to iCER, VCR and other design adaptations. Combined with low fuel consumption, this means that X-DF outperforms current high-pressure LNG engines in total greenhouse gas emissions in several vessel applications. In even more applications, low opex and initial system costs mean that total vessel lifecycle costs remain lower for X-DF than for high-pressure counterparts, regardless of IMO penalties.

Time in the market and continuous improvement have enabled us to develop an engine platform that will yield the best performance, whether operating in fossil LNG or biological or synthetic derivatives. Regardless of the status of NZF, those years of refinements will pay dividends for operators choosing methane.

What happens next is far from clear. If the global framework were to fail, a patchwork of regional regulatory regimes would likely follow. Across several regions, port authorities are working to lower air pollution in their communities. It is therefore possible that, as regions regulate, they expand the scope of their emissions policy to include not only GHG but also air pollutants.

“We have reduced slippage by 60%”

In such a case, X-DF again has benefits for operators, offering the best air pollution profile of any LNG dual-fuel engine. That includes SOx, NOx and particulate matter. While IMO’s threshold requirements for NOx and SOx hide X-DF’s advantages, under schemes where operators pay for polluting the air, its low emissions profile would translate to real cost savings.

The Net Zero Framework would not have killed the use of LNG, but its pause certainly enhances the business case. Regardless, WinGD’s near decade of optimising the X-DF platform mean operators will pay less, whether they use fossil LNG or transition to cleaner variants. And it opens up new opportunities for air pollution improvements that could also have a significant financial impact on operators.",https://dvzpv6x5302g1.cloudfront.net/AcuCustom/Sitename/DAM/184/Benny_Hilstr_m_Vice_President_of_Market_Development_WinGDwebzjhgf1_Main.png,N,,2025-11-21 00:56:09.410974

The report, which draws on data from SHS’s own projects, the ICS Barometer 2024-2025, the IMO-WISTA Women in Maritime Survey 2024 and other key research, positions seafarer wellbeing as a core factor influencing safety, retention, and the success of the transition to net zero. It argues that the industry cannot achieve a “just transition” without a supported workforce.

Meaningful support can be simple and effective. However, to build long-term resilience for the industry, we need systemic investment and coordinated action.

…said Sandra Welch, CEO, Seafarers Hospital Society.

Seafarers under pressure

When faced with rapidly evolving operational expectations, limited clarity on training pathways, and regulatory inconsistencies exist across regions, it is no surprise that seafarers are reporting higher levels of anxiety. Concerns around criminalisation in the event of onboard incidents or being held liable for compliance issues are also on the rise, further exacerbating the issue.

The International Chamber of Shipping’s Maritime Barometer Report 2024–2025 revealed a sector under significant external pressure, particularly from geopolitical instability, cyber risks, regulatory burdens, and crew shortages. The ripple effects are felt most acutely by seafarers, many of whom operate at the sharp edge of these global disruptions. The report calls for greater collaboration with governments and regulators, a clear regulatory framework, and targeted investment in crew welfare and training to ensure long-term sustainability.

That question of investment is a critical one. There can be no doubt that businesses are under pressure, from compliance costs to market fluctuations, and that investment in crew health and wellbeing may sometimes seem like a secondary priority.

However, the value of retaining experienced crew is far more cost-effective than replacing them with new trainees. The institutional knowledge held by long-serving officers and ratings is invaluable, and once lost, it can be extremely difficult to replace.

Investing in the future workforce

The financial burdens borne by seafarers, from training costs to wage insecurity, are unsustainable. These should not fall on individuals but be addressed through systemic investment and coordinated action. Similarly, mental health challenges are increasing, fuelled by intense workloads, fatigue and isolation.

Initiatives such as SHS’ work with Togetherall and the Seafarers Advice & Information Line (SAIL) have provided support, but further industry-wide action is needed to reduce stigma, increase access, and protect psychological safety at sea.

The industry must also act decisively on recruitment and retention. This includes creating career pathways that attract and retain skilled professionals, especially women and other underrepresented groups, and ensuring seafarers are trained and equipped for the evolving demands of sustainable shipping. Diversity must be more than a target; it must be embedded into every part of maritime life, from policy to practice.

Recruitment and retention

The maritime industry faces the critical challenge of attracting, training, and retaining a steady stream of qualified seafarers. Geopolitical tensions, decarbonisation, expansion of supply chains, and the need for gender parity demand a proactive and holistic approach to maintain and grow a strong maritime workforce.

The IMO-WISTA Women in Maritime Survey 2024 highlighted that progress on gender equality is struggling in places. It found that while the number of women working in maritime globally has grown by 14% since 2021, their overall share of the workforce has dropped to just under 19%, down from 26%. The situation is even more stark at sea, where women make up just 1% of the total seafarer population.

There is now a strong industry-wide consensus on the need to tackle these challenges. Seafarers are finally being officially recognised as key workers – and with that recognition comes a responsibility for employers to provide safe, supportive working environments that enable them not just to perform, but to thrive.

Speaking at the opening ceremony (November 17), John Lee, Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), urged stronger international collaboration to overcome challenges and forge a more sustainable future for maritime industries.

""In a world being reshaped by geopolitical discord, technological disruption and climate change, these themes are more than aspirational. They sound an alarm, a wake-up call to collective action,"" Mr Lee said. ""Hong Kong's role as a stable, reliable and dynamic maritime hub has never been more vital. The principle of 'one country, two systems' is the cornerstone of our success, providing us with an unshakeable foundation.""

Mr Lee also attended the opening of the two-day Asian Logistics, Maritime and Aviation Conference (ALMAC) (November 17-18), an anchor event of HKMW that welcomed some 2,300 high-profile logistics leaders and professionals from more than 40 countries and regions . During the event, he unveiled the first batch of ports under the newly established Partner Port network.

""I am particularly pleased to announce that Hong Kong has established Partner Port relationships with Guangxi port and Dalian port in the Chinese Mainland, and Port San Antonio in Chile,"" Mr Lee said. ""These ports are of strategic importance, and true to our character and policy priorities. As an international maritime centre, we connect the Chinese Mainland with the world and seek partners who support an open, international trade order.""

Echoing the theme of the HKMW 2025, the HKSAR Government's Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Mable Chan, said green transformation is a major global trend in the maritime industry. To help meet the International Maritime Organization (IMO)'s target of achieving net-zero carbon emissions from international shipping by 2050, the government was bringing together all parties, including fuel suppliers and other IMO members to achieve this goal as a joint force.

In a media interview, Ms Chan outlined recent government initiatives to promote green shipping. These include announcing the Code of Practice on LNG Bunkering and Code of Practice on Methanol Bunkering, and launching the Green Maritime Fuel Bunkering Incentive Scheme to provide incentives to pioneer companies conducting green maritime fuel bunkering businesses in Hong Kong for relevant bunkering operations.

""The government facilitated the conduct of the first liquefied natural gas (LNG) ship-to-ship bunkering demonstration by the industry in February 2025. Since then, 13 commercial LNG bunkering operations have been successfully conducted, regularising the provision of commercial LNG bunkering services in Hong Kong,"" Ms Chan said. ""These demonstrate Hong Kong's great potential in developing green maritime fuel bunkering.""

Paul Chan, Financial Secretary of the HKSAR Government, highlighted opportunities arising from decarbonisation. Speaking at the Hong Kong Global Maritime Trade Summit (November 17) themed ""Building Resilience, Driving Growth and Investment"", Mr Chan said that maritime decarbonisation represents a ""multi-trillion-dollar investment opportunity"" through 2050.

""The transition to zero-emission marine fuels could create up to 4 million jobs globally across the energy supply chain,"" he said. ""Here in Hong Kong, we are embracing this. For example, we have published an Action Plan on Green Maritime Fuel Bunkering, positioning ourselves as a regional hub for sustainable fuel supply. Our goal is to provide bunkering services for green fuels to ocean-going vessels more than 60 times per year by 2030, involving over 200,000 tonnes of green maritime fuels.""

Hong Kong ranks fourth, globally, in the International Shipping Centre Development Index for six consecutive years and is home to more than 1,200 port and maritime-related companies, a thriving cluster of global leaders in ship management, finance, insurance and law.

To enhance the city's leading position in high value-added maritime services, Mr Lee said Hong Kong would make good use of its ""one country, two systems"" advantages, including being China's only bilingual common law jurisdiction as well as offering a simple and low tax regime, free port status and the unfettered flow of capital, information and talent.

Ms Chan said, ""We will strengthen collaboration with international marine insurance organisations to upscale the training of marine insurance talents, whilst expanding the scope of the Maritime and Aviation Training Fund to cover more green energy courses, thereby reinforcing Hong Kong maritime strengths.""

By harnessing the power of AI, blockchain, cloud computing and other cutting-edge technologies, Hong Kong is developing a Port Community System, to be launched in January 2026. It will enable real-time cargo tracking and facilitate data exchange across transport modes, boosting trade and capital flows digitally, opening up new opportunities, from trade financing to more efficient customs declaration.

With LNG bunkering networks already sprawled across key trade routes, operators can start onboard hydrogen production without waiting on specialized infrastructure.","DNV has handed out an Approval in Principle (AIP) to Hycamite TCD Technologies’ onboard methane splitting system for LNG-powered vessels. After months of rigorous tech checks and safety deep-dives, this marks the first-ever green light for a pre-combustion carbon capture approach in shipping—finally taking onboard hydrogen production out of the lab and onto real ships.

The drive towards maritime decarbonization has never been hotter. The IMO is aiming to slash greenhouse gases in half by 2050, and Europe’s Fit for 55 rules are ratcheting down emissions even faster. Sure, fuels like ammonia, methanol or liquid hydrogen get tossed around as alternatives, but each one brings headaches—be it tricky storage, hefty bills or shaky supply chains. That’s where methane splitting comes in, letting operators stick with mature LNG bunkering while cranking out near-zero-emission hydrogen onboard.

Could this be the answer to shipping’s carbon problem?

Here’s the thing: most LNG ships still burn methane, pumping out CO₂ and that sneaky “methane slip.” Meanwhile, steam methane reforming onshore racks up 9–20 kg CO₂e to produce every kilo of H₂, and electrolyzers demand mountains of renewable power. With Hycamite’s thermocatalytic decomposition (TCD), CH₄ is split into two gold stars—hydrogen and solid carbon—while locking in emissions before they ever see daylight. The result? Under 1 kg CO₂e per kg H₂ on deck.

At the center of it all is Kokkola, a tight-knit Finnish city tossing its weight around in heavy industry. Home to Hycamite’s customer sample facility (CSF), one of Europe’s biggest TCD plants, Kokkola benefits from Finland’s forward-thinking climate policies, a buzzing research scene and a knack for spinning deep-tech ideas into commercial gold.

How the TCD process delivers hydrogen and solid carbon

Think of it like this: methane from the ship’s LNG tanks enters a sealed reactor warmed to 800–1000 °C. Inside, a proprietary catalyst gets to work, cleaving CH₄ into two handy products:

Hydrogen gas – piped straight to fuel cells or dual-fuel engines, offering high power density and nary a whiff of CO₂ on exhaust.

Solid carbon – captured in onboard bins at room temperature, then offloaded at port and sold off as graphite or specialty carbon materials.

No oxygen means no CO₂ slip, and the whole setup needs about 87% less energy than electrolyzers. It’s efficiency and maritime decarbonization rolled into one slick package.

Best part? The TCD module is built to integrate with existing LNG fuel systems—think Wärtsilä’s LNGPac. That means minimal design tweaks, shorter dock times and an easier retrofit path for both old hulls and new builds. Capital outlay stays in check, letting shipowners hit the water faster.

Safety and certification on the high seas

Playing with hydrogen at sea demands bulletproof safety. Hycamite’s setup features double-walled reactors, automated pressure relief valves and nonstop process monitoring. The reactor’s oxygen-free zone keeps flammables at bay, and DNV’s exhaustive risk assessment gave it a seal of approval. With this DNV Approval in the logbook, Hycamite is gearing up for type approval and full-class certification—opening the door to commercial rollouts worldwide.

Who’s steering the ship?

Hycamite TCD Technologies sprang from Finland’s top research institutes, amassing a suite of patents around methane splitting. Their Kokkola CSF proves continuous, reliable hydrogen and carbon output at scale. On the flip side, DNV—the venerable Norwegian classification society—brings a century of maritime safety expertise, assessing risk, ensuring compliance and fast-tracking innovative tech through its AIP process.

Why operators should be excited

Shipowners and operators stand to gain big time:

Immediate emissions cuts – onboard hydrogen production emits zero CO₂ at point of use, helping you hit IMO and EU targets.

Competitive costs – producing H₂ on deck for roughly $2–3/kg using stranded LNG feedstock undercuts delivered liquid hydrogen prices.

Additional revenue – turn the solid carbon byproduct into cash by selling to battery, steel or composite makers.

Compliance and credits – pre-combustion carbon capture aligns with emerging carbon markets, unlocking tradable credits.

Negative carbon potential – swap in biomethane feedstock and you lock away CO₂, making your vessel a floating carbon sink.

Retrofit-ready design – modular units slot into a range of ship types, from small chemical tankers to giant container vessels.

Looking ahead, Hycamite plans to roll out over 50 shipboard modules by 2030. Partnerships with major engine builders and leading shipyards mean the first retrofits could hit the water in as little as two years—exactly the pace maritime decarbonization needs.

What could this mean for global shipping?

Imagine a container vessel crossing the Pacific, generating its own hydrogen each voyage, then offloading its solid carbon byproduct at port as a valuable commodity. A fleet-wide rollout could eliminate millions of tonnes of CO₂ from maritime operations annually. Ports would transform from simple bunkering stops into vibrant carbon-material trading hubs—linking seaborne trade directly to onshore decarbonization efforts.

Setting sail towards a greener future

This DNV Approval in Principle isn’t just a technical nod—it’s a signal that pre-combustion carbon capture via methane splitting has matured. With LNG bunkering networks already sprawled across key trade routes, operators can start onboard hydrogen production without waiting on specialized infrastructure. As IMO regulations tighten and shipowners hunt for cost-effective decarbonization routes, Hycamite’s solution is poised to become the standard for next-generation propulsion.

So, what’s next? Keep your eyes peeled for those first Hycamite retrofits and purpose-built newbuilds. If they deliver on their promise, we’ll likely see a wave of cleaner vessels charting greener courses—proof that the voyage to net-zero shipping is already underway.",https://www.hydrogenfuelnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/resized-1763460361927.jpeg,N,,2025-11-20 09:57:28.013599

The board emphasizes that this represents a groundbreaking instance of the U.N. attempting to levy a tax, with revenues directed into a U.N.-controlled fund.

The proposed framework aims to impose fees of $100 to $380 per metric ton of carbon dioxide emissions above certain thresholds, potentially generating $10 billion to $12 billion annually. The board warns that these charges could lead to a 10% increase in global shipping costs, ultimately raising prices for American households dependent on imported goods.

Unlike traditional U.N. funding, which comes mainly from accountable governments, this carbon tax would be directed into a new “Net Zero Fund” managed directly by IMO staff. While the fund aims to promote green shipping innovations and initiatives to help developing countries cope with climate change impacts, the editorial criticizes it as a means for income redistribution based on U.N. bureaucratic priorities.

The piece raises significant governance concerns, asking how decisions regarding tax rate increases would be made by a committee of over 170 member states, suggesting that local voters, such as those in Boston or Berlin, would have minimal influence. The board interprets Western governments’ support for the plan as an attempt by climate-focused politicians to solidify their agenda before facing voter backlash against net-zero initiatives in democracies.

The Trump Administration has threatened sanctions against countries that support the measure. The board concludes that the president should deter the IMO from pursuing the global carbon tax plan, viewing it as beneficial to both Americans and other democracies.

From Issue 6, 2025 of Breakbulk Magazine

(2-minute read)

Luke Mace, senior vice president, freight forwarding / project logistics, GEODIS

One of the main challenges lies in finding a balance between growth ambitions and reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. There is a clear imbalance between transit times and cost efficiency versus customer expectations.

If we look at short-term and impactful actions, it’s about using the most efficient solutions available today, such as prioritizing sea or rail transport over air whenever possible, selecting the most energy-efficient aircraft or vessels (for example through GEODIS AirSmart), increasing the use of available low-carbon fuels such as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), sustainable marine fuel (SMF) or hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO), which can reduce GHG emissions by up to 80%, and ensuring space utilization so we don’t ship empty space.

GEODIS AirSmart is a great illustration. The company has recently launched this new low-carbon airfreight solution, designed to significantly reduce GHG emissions by optimizing aircraft performance and routing. By selecting the most energy-efficient aircraft and leveraging external flight data and advanced analytics, GEODIS AirSmart enables smarter routing decisions and enhances performance.

This innovation represents a major step forward in GEODIS’s journey toward decarbonization and supports customers in achieving their climate goals. With GEODIS AirSmart we can achieve up to 40% reduction in GHG emission per shipment.

Roger Strevens, director, low carbon regulation and advocacy, Methanex

In mid-October, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) held a meeting to consider the adoption of the Net Zero Framework (NZF), the regulatory package that is intended to deliver on the goals of its 2023 GHG strategy, which was unanimously supported by member states. The NZF had been approved, the first step in the regulatory process, by a large majority back in April at Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) 83.

However, due to widely reported pressure from the U.S., many member states changed their positions. The outcome was that a vote was called to adjourn the adoption meeting by a year, and it was carried 57-49.

While adjournment of the adoption meeting was disappointing to many, it is important to note the NZF has not been rejected, rather member states are not in a position to adopt it yet. Critically, there is now time to develop the NZF to a point where there is consensus for adoption.

It is important for the IMO not to lose momentum. Work continues on the supporting guidelines, and the IMO Secretariat will consult closely with member states to determine the best path forward. The consistent support from global shipping organizations highlights the industry’s readiness to advance sustainability and clean fuels. A unified global approach for a global industry is economically and environmentally preferable to fragmented regulations that are separated by national and regional borders.

For breakbulk shipping companies, the NZF deferral may temporarily pause decisions around retrofitting or ordering vessels for alternative fuels, but it also offers a window to monitor developments like the upcoming review of FuelEU Maritime. Given the long-term nature of fleet investments, it remains prudent to anticipate the growing prominence of decarbonization regulations.

In this context, methanol stands out as a compelling option for breakbulk vessels due to its favorable overall cost, lower complexity and minimal impact on cargo space. It is compatible with tramp operations due to the relatively low cost of port infrastructure needed, making it an attractive choice. Methanex is committed to supporting shipping companies as they navigate these decisions.

In summary, given that the shipping industry wants to progress and leading clean fuel producers are poised to deliver, the pace of political alignment will be crucial for future progress.

INFORMATION REQUIRED IN REGISTRATION STATEMENT

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

Overview

HyOrc Corporation (“HyOrc,” “we,” “our,” or the “Company”) is a Wyoming corporation engaged in the research, development, and commercialization of clean-energy technologies designed to decarbonize heavy-duty transport, industrial power generation, and distributed energy applications. Our mission is to develop commercially viable alternatives to diesel engines and fossil fuels, with a focus on hydrogen, methanol, and waste-to-energy solutions.

Our business is structured around three primary technology and market verticals:

1.Green Methanol Production – producing renewable methanol from waste, targeting shipping and aviation fuel markets.

2.Hydrogen Power Systems – developing modular hydrogen-fueled ORC (Organic Rankine Cycle) engines for off-grid power and pay-as-you-go (“PAYG”) deployment.

3.Hydrogen Locomotive Retrofits – converting existing diesel locomotives to hydrogen-fueled systems.

Through our wholly owned subsidiary, SRE Power, Inc., we also developed a 2MW geothermal power plant in Biliran, Philippines. While that facility is currently offline due to disputes with counterparties and storm damage, it demonstrates our technical execution capability in building power plants under challenging conditions.

Corporate History

The Company was originally incorporated in Nevada in 1998 as Asia Properties, Inc. (“ASPZ”), focused initially on unrelated businesses. The company was re-domiciled in Wyoming in 2019. In August 2024, ASPZ completed a reverse merger with SRE Power, Inc., a renewable energy company with a history of geothermal project development and hydrogen combustion technologies. As part of the transaction, ASPZ was renamed HyOrc Corporation. Following the merger, former SRE shareholders became the controlling shareholders of HyOrc.

This merger provided HyOrc with:

●Operational experience in power plant construction.

●A platform to commercialize hydrogen and methanol technologies.

●A publicly traded vehicle to access capital markets.

Technology Platform

HyOrc’s core innovation is its External Combustion Technology (ECT) engine, which integrates with ORC turbines. Unlike conventional internal combustion engines or fuel cells, the ECT engine can run on multiple fuels while maintaining high efficiency and durability.

Key features include:

●Fuel Flexibility: Operates on hydrogen, LPG, natural gas, biogas, or syngas.

●Hydrogen Tolerance: Achieves >45% efficiency even with hydrogen purity as low as 97%, whereas PEM fuel cells typically require >99.9%.

●Durability: Stable efficiency over long operating hours, compared with efficiency degradation in PEM fuel cells.

●Cost Competitiveness: Comparable total cost of ownership to diesel engines, but with zero emissions when operating on hydrogen.

In addition to the ECT engine, HyOrc has developed intellectual property for waste-to-methanol production. This technology gasifies municipal solid waste and catalytically converts syngas into methanol. Methanol is an established global commodity chemical, increasingly adopted as a green fuel for shipping and aviation.

Principal Business Lines

1. Green Methanol Production

●Market Context: The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has mandated carbon reduction in global shipping. Green methanol is emerging as a favored solution, with major shipping lines such as Maersk and CMA CGM announcing large methanol-powered fleet orders. Aviation regulators are also exploring methanol-based synthetic fuels.

●HyOrc Projects: The Company is advancing development of methanol projects in Portugal and the United Kingdom, each based on proprietary waste-to-methanol technology. Discussions are underway with potential off-takers and partners.

●Competitive Advantage: HyOrc’s process leverages waste as a feedstock, reducing reliance on costly green hydrogen inputs and addressing municipal waste management challenges.

2. PAYG Hydrogen Power Systems

●Market Context: Critical infrastructure such as ports, hospitals, and data centers require zero-emission, reliable backup or off-grid power. Existing fuel cell solutions face challenges in cost, durability, and hydrogen purity requirements.

●HyOrc Solution: Modular PAYG hydrogen power units powered by our ECT engine. Customers purchase electricity on a pay-as-you-go model, minimizing upfront CAPEX.

●Pilot Projects: HyOrc is preparing pilot deployments in California (e.g., Port of Long Beach) and the EU.

●Competitive Advantage: Higher efficiency than fuel cells over time, lower total cost of ownership, and multi-fuel security.

3. Hydrogen Locomotive Retrofits

●Market Context: Rail is a major contributor to transportation emissions. Europe alone has more than 15,000 diesel locomotives in need of decarbonization. India, with its massive rail network, is aggressively pursuing hydrogen pilots.

●HyOrc Solution: Retrofit kits replacing diesel engines with hydrogen-fueled ECT turbines.

●Progress to Date:

○Advanced proposals submitted to Banaras Locomotive Works (BLW) of Indian Railways for retrofitting the first of 1,500 diesel locomotives.

○Initiatives under discussion with EU partners for a fleet retrofit program.

●Competitive Advantage: Retrofit approach allows reuse of rolling stock at lower cost than purchasing new locomotives.

4. Geothermal Legacy Asset

●Through SRE, HyOrc developed a 2MW geothermal power plant in Biliran, Philippines, completed in September 2023.

●The plant has remained offline since October 2024 due to a legal dispute with our counterparty. SRE Power retains economic rights and is pursuing legal remedies.

●Classified as Work-in-Progress on the balance sheet, with potential future recovery.

Intellectual Property

HyOrc’s IP portfolio includes:

●Patents filed/granted in India covering hydrogen engines, waste-to-methanol processes, and locomotive retrofits.

●Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) extensions into the United States and European Union, currently under review.

●Trade secrets relating to catalytic conversion and system integration.

Competition

Our competitors fall into several categories:

●Fuel Cells (PEMFC, SOFC): Compete in hydrogen applications, but face challenges with purity requirements, high CAPEX, and limited lifespan.

●Battery-Electric Solutions: Effective in light vehicles and short-range applications but impractical for heavy trucks, locomotives, or long-haul shipping.

●Conventional ICEs: Diesel and natural gas engines remain entrenched but are rapidly facing regulatory phase out in multiple jurisdictions as they cannot economically run with very low or zero greenhouse emissions required to achieve net zero needed to stabilise and reverse climate change. HyOrc differentiates through efficiency, durability, fuel flexibility, and lower lifecycle cost.

Regulatory Environment

HyOrc operates in industries subject to evolving regulations:

●Shipping: IMO 2023 regulations require significant CO2 reductions.

●Aviation: ICAO CORSIA program driving demand for sustainable aviation fuels.

●Power Generation: Renewable portfolio standards and carbon pricing schemes in the EU and U.S. create tailwinds for hydrogen and methanol.

●Rail: India and EU have launched hydrogen locomotive initiatives.

Growth Strategy

HyOrc intends to:

●Secure long-term offtake agreements for green methanol.

●Deploy PAYG hydrogen pilots in ports and critical infrastructure.

●Close locomotive retrofit agreements in India and the EU.

●Raise capital via OTCQB uplist and eventual Nasdaq listing to fund commercialization.

●Expand patent portfolio globally.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

An investment in our common stock involves significant risks. Investors should carefully consider the risks described below, together with the other information included in this Form 10, before making an investment decision. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.

Going Concern and Liquidity Risks

We have incurred recurring operating losses since inception, including a net loss of $1.63 million in 2024. As of December 31, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of $8.2 million. Our auditors have included a going concern emphasis in their report. Unless we can secure additional financing in the near term, we may be unable to continue our operations as planned. There is no assurance that such financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all.

Dependence on Access to Capital

Our business strategy requires significant capital expenditures for R&D, manufacturing, and commercialization of our hydrogen engines and methanol projects. We estimate that we will need to raise at least $20 million over the next 24 months to achieve our objectives. If we cannot raise sufficient capital, we may have to delay or reduce the scope of our projects, which would adversely affect our growth prospects.

Dilution of Shareholders

We expect to finance future operations primarily through the issuance of equity or equity-linked securities. Any such issuances will dilute existing shareholders. Because we are currently an OTCID company with limited trading volume, new financings may be highly dilutive.

Early Stage of Commercialization

Our hydrogen engine technology and waste-to-methanol processes are in the pilot or development stage. Commercial adoption depends on successful scale-up, demonstration projects, and customer acceptance. If we are unable to prove reliability and cost-effectiveness at commercial scale, our business could fail to gain traction.

Technology and Development Risks

While we believe our technology offers advantages over fuel cells and batteries, it remains unproven at scale in commercial operations. Unexpected technical challenges could delay or prevent commercialization. Competing technologies may also advance more rapidly than anticipated, reducing our competitive advantage.

Reliance on Third-Party Manufacturing and Partners

We currently do not operate large-scale manufacturing facilities. Our business plan contemplates reliance on third-party manufacturers, such as Toyo Denki, Leroy Somer, Siemens, Kirloskar, RJ Italia, John Crane, Crompton, and Schneider for production of engines and components. If these manufacturers cannot deliver to our specifications or within agreed timelines, our operations will be adversely affected.

Counterparty Risks – Biliran Project

Through SRE Power, we constructed a 2MW geothermal plant in Biliran, Philippines. The plant is currently offline due to legal dispute for which we are pursuing legal remedies, but the outcome is uncertain. Our inability to recover value from this project could negatively impact our financial condition.

Customer Concentration and Project Risks

Our near-term opportunities involve large projects, such as locomotive retrofits with Indian Railways and methanol plants in Europe. If we fail to secure or execute these projects, our revenue generation could be delayed for years. In addition, delays, cost overruns, or cancellations could materially harm our financial position.

Market Adoption Risks

The success of our products depends on adoption by customers who have historically relied on diesel, natural gas, or grid power. Customers may be reluctant to adopt new technologies due to perceived risk, cost, or lack of familiarity. If adoption is slower than anticipated, our revenue and growth will be adversely affected.

Competitive Risks

We compete against established technologies including: (i) PEM fuel cells, supported by significant investment; (ii) battery-electric systems; and (iii) conventional diesel and gas engines. Many of our competitors have greater financial, technical, and manufacturing resources than we do. If these competitors succeed in improving efficiency or lowering costs, our products may not achieve significant market share.

Regulatory and Policy Risks

Our operations are subject to complex and evolving regulations across multiple jurisdictions. For example, methanol projects depend on renewable fuel standards in the EU, while hydrogen deployment depends on government incentives and mandates in India and Europe. Changes in political priorities or reductions in incentives could materially impact demand for our products.

Intellectual Property Risks

Our competitive advantage depends on our patents and proprietary technology. While we have secured patents in India and filed PCT extensions in the U.S. and EU, there is no assurance that additional patents will be granted or that existing patents will not be challenged. Competitors may develop similar technology that circumvents our IP. Enforcement of IP rights is costly and uncertain, particularly in emerging markets.

Supply Chain Risks

Our technology depends on the availability of high-grade materials, catalysts, and components. Disruptions in global supply chains—such as shortages of metals, electronics, or catalysts—could increase costs or delay projects.

Geopolitical Risks

Our projects span multiple jurisdictions including the Philippines, India, the EU, and the United States. Political instability, changes in trade policies, or currency fluctuations in these regions could negatively affect operations.

Management and Key Personnel Risks

We are highly dependent on a small group of executives and technical leaders. The loss of any key personnel, particularly our CEO or CTO, could harm our ability to execute our strategy. We currently have limited bench strength and may struggle to recruit qualified personnel.

Risks of Operating as a Public Company

As a public company, we are subject to SEC reporting requirements and associated costs. We are in the process of uplisting from OTCID to OTCQB and eventually Nasdaq. Failure to successfully uplist could limit liquidity, reduce investor interest, and impair our ability to raise capital.

Share Price Volatility

Our common stock has experienced, and may continue to experience, extreme price volatility and low trading volume. The market price of our stock may be influenced by announcements regarding project milestones, financing events, or litigation. Such volatility may discourage institutional investors from participating.

Litigation and Legal Risks

We are engaged in disputes concerning the Biliran project. Litigation is costly, time-consuming, and uncertain. Adverse rulings could materially affect our financial position.

Cybersecurity and IT Risks

Our operations and intellectual property are dependent on digital systems. A cyberattack or data breach could result in the theft of proprietary technology or disruption of our operations.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2024, and the related notes thereto, which are included elsewhere in this Form 10. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements due to factors set forth in “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Form 10.

Overview

HyOrc Corporation is in the development and early commercialization phase of its clean-energy technology business. Our 2024 financial results reflect the first year of revenue recognition, primarily from technical services provided through our subsidiary SRE Power. The Company also incurred significant expenses related to research and development, legal proceedings, and the reverse merger transaction with SRE.

Expansion of our business is capital intensive, and we expect to continue to incur operating losses in the near term as we build infrastructure, develop pilot projects, and pursue commercialization of our hydrogen engines, waste-to-methanol technology, and locomotive retrofit systems.

Results of Operations

Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2024, Compared to Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2023

●Revenues: In 2024, we generated revenues of approximately $617,000, primarily from technical service contracts related to SRE Power’s geothermal power station project. In contrast, we recorded no revenues in 2023. The initiation of revenues reflects early commercialization of SRE’s engineering expertise, though not yet related to hydrogen or methanol products.

●Operating Expenses: Operating expenses increased significantly to approximately $2.2 million in 2024 from $63,000 in 2023. The increase reflects higher R&D and equipment expenditures, legal and professional fees associated with litigation and the merger and expanded corporate governance costs.

●Net Loss: Net loss for 2024 was approximately $1.63 million, compared to a net loss of $63,000 in 2023. The increase reflects the scaling of operations, investment in technology, and legal/professional expenses.

●Balance Sheet Highlights: Total assets increased to approximately $22.2 million at December 31, 2024, compared to $6.5 million at December 31, 2023. The increase is primarily attributable to recognition of intangible assets and goodwill from the reverse merger, as well as classification of the Biliran plant contract asset as a non-current asset. Liabilities remained modest, reflecting limited use of debt financing.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

As of December 31, 2024, we had limited cash resources and remain dependent on external financing to fund operations. Subsequent to year-end, we raised approximately $110,000 through the issuance of common stock to investors. These proceeds provide near-term working capital but are not sufficient for commercialization.

We estimate that we will require at least $20 million in additional capital over the next 24 months to:

●Develop and construct our first commercial waste-to-methanol facilities in Portugal and the UK.

●Deploy pilot PAYG hydrogen units in California and Europe.

●Advance locomotive retrofit programs with Indian Railways and EU partners.

Sources of capital may include equity issuances, convertible debt, strategic joint ventures, engineering services and project financing. If we are unable to secure financing, we may delay or scale back projects.

Cash Flows

●Operating Activities: Net cash used in operating activities was approximately $550,000 in 2024, compared to minimal usage in 2023. The increase reflects higher expenditures related to R&D, litigation, and professional services.

●Investing Activities: Minimal, other than expenditures related to technology development and project preparation.

●Financing Activities: Provided cash inflows through equity issuances, including share sales to Richard Oblath and Carl Mueller in early 2025.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Preparation requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Key policies include:

1.Revenue Recognition (ASC 606) – We recognize revenue when performance obligations are satisfied, which in 2024 primarily related to technical service contracts.

2.Business Combinations (ASC 805) – The reverse merger with SRE required purchase price allocation and recognition of goodwill and intangible assets.

3.Impairment of Long-Lived Assets (ASC 360) – We evaluate plant, equipment, and intangible assets for impairment if events indicate carrying amounts may not be recoverable. The Biliran project is classified as Work-in-Progress but not impaired at this time.

4.Going Concern (ASC 205-40) – Given recurring losses and limited capital, management has evaluated going concern considerations and disclosed the need for additional financing.

Going Concern Considerations

Our financial statements include an emphasis of matter regarding doubts about our ability to continue as a going concern. While management believes we can raise sufficient funds and secure contracts to support operations, there is no assurance of success.

Outlook

Looking ahead, we are focused on:

●Advancing green methanol projects in Portugal and the UK toward FEED studies and offtake agreements.

●Deploying PAYG hydrogen power pilots in California and Europe.

●Securing agreements with Banaras Locomotive Works in India for locomotive retrofits.

●Defending our position in the Biliran dispute to protect shareholder value.

●Uplisting to OTCQB and pursuing Nasdaq listing to access broader capital markets.

Management believes these initiatives, if successfully executed, will position the Company for significant revenue generation beginning in 2026.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of HyOrc Corporation (f/k/a Asia Properties Inc)

Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of HyOrc Corporation and the subsidiary (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity (deficit) and consolidated statements of cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024, and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles of United States of America.

Matters related to Going Concern

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements if it is unable to obtain sufficient amount of additional capital, it may be required to reduce the scope of its planned development. The company has suffered losses from operations and has an accumulated deficit that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Explanatory Paragraph - Other Non-Current Assets and Related Impairment

We draw attention to Note 1 and Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements regarding recognition of Other Non Current Assets towards the lien by the company over the Geothermal facility establishing the right over those assets and the subsequent impairment on account of the facility being non operational due to persistent grid instability and the physical damage caused by the typhoon and dispute with BGI and realisability of the claim from the insurance company and the consequential management estimate towards recognition of impairment of

$300,000.

Our opinion is not modified with respect to this matter.

Basis for Opinion

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The company is not required to have, nor we have engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.

Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

HYORC CORPORATION. AND SUBSIDIARY

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1. ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The Company was initially organized in the name of Asia Properties, Inc. on April 6, 1998, as a Wyoming Corporation, seeking opportunities to invest in real estate. On April 3, 2019. the Company moved its jurisdiction from the State of Nevada to the State of Wyoming. The Company’s common stock is trading in the OTC Market under the symbol “ASPZ”.

From 2022, the Company has been exploring different potential gold mining opportunities and is focused on gold mines with NI 43-101 or JORC geological reports with indicated or measured reserves.

On June 27, 2024, the Company acquired a Texas hydrogen technology company, SRE Power, Inc (“SRE”) for 655,374,256 newly issued ASPZ common stock. SRE is now 100% owned by ASPZ. ASPZ is now conducting the business of developing the HyOrc hydrogen engine technology and the other technologies owned by SRE. ASPZ filed for a name change with Wyoming in September 2024 and is currently doing business as HyOrc Corporation. (“HyOrc” / “we”/ “our”/ “us”) (Refer to Principles of Consolidation below).

Basis of Presentation

The Company’s fiscal year ends on December 31.

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S.GAAP”) in all material respects and have been consistently applied in preparing the accompanying financial statements.

Reverse Acquisition and Principles of Consolidation

As described above, on June 27, 2024 (the “Acquisition Date”), the Company entered into a reorganization and stock purchase agreement (“agreement”) with SRE and the 100% shareholders of SRE whereby the SRE shareholders desired to sell and the Company agreed to purchase SRE shares thereby making SRE, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The Company issued 655,374,256 shares as the purchase consideration to the SRE shareholders. Following the closing of the agreement, SRE shareholders collectively owned around 90% of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company on a fully diluted basis.

Further, at the closing, the then Board member of the Company. Debra Childers had tendered her resignation as the director and the officer of the Company and the then Board considered and deemed it advisable to the best interest of the Company to fill the vacancy in the Board by appointing Reginald Fubara, Shinichi Hirano and James McNaught-Davis as the members of the Company’s Board of Directors effective as of the closing.

We determine SRE an accounting acquirer based on the following facts: (i) after the reverse acquisition, former shareholders of SRE held a majority of the voting interest of the combined company; (ii) former Board of Directors of SRE possess majority control of the Board of Directors of the combined company; (iii) Reginald, being the member of the management of SRE is responsible for the management of the combined company. As such, we have treated the financial statements of SRE as the historical financial statements of the combined company (“consolidated financial statements” / “financial statements”).

We have identified the Company as the legal acquirer, as it is the entity that issued securities. Comparatively, we have identified SRE as the legal acquiree, the entity whose equity interests are acquired in line with ASC 805-40 – Reverse Acquisitions. (Refer to Note 3).

Consequent to the reverse acquisition, the financial statements of the newly combined entity represent a continuation of the financial statements of the accounting acquirer/legal acquiree. As a result, the assets and liabilities of the accounting acquirer are presented at their historical carrying values in the consolidated financial statements of the newly combined entity and the assets and liabilities of the accounting acquiree/legal acquirer are recognized on the acquisition date and measured by using the acquisition method. The results of the accounting acquiree’s/legal acquirer’s results of operations are included in the combined company’s financial statements beginning on the acquisition date.

The accompanying financial statements prepared following the reverse acquisition are issued under the name of the accounting acquiree, HyOrc but described as a continuation of the financial statements of the accounting acquirer, SRE, with one adjustment, which is to retroactively adjust the accounting acquirer’s legal capital to reflect the legal capital of the accounting acquiree.

That adjustment is required to reflect the capital of the accounting acquiree. Comparative information presented in these consolidated financial statements also is retroactively adjusted to reflect the legal capital of the accounting acquiree.

The accompanying financial statements represent all of the following:

a. The assets and liabilities of SRE recognized and measured at their pre-combination carrying amounts.

b. The assets and liabilities of HyOrc recognized and measured in accordance with the guidance in ASC 805 applicable to business combinations.

c. The retained earnings and other equity balances of the SRE before the business combination.

d. The amount recognized as issued equity interests in the financial statements determined by adding the issued equity interest of SRE outstanding immediately before the business combination to the fair value HyOrc determined in accordance with the guidance in ASC 805 applicable to business combinations. However, the equity structure (that is, the number and type of equity interests issued) reflects the equity structure of HyOrc, including the equity interests which HyOrc issued to the SRE shareholders to effect the combination. Accordingly, the equity structure of SRE is restated using the exchange ratio established in the Agreement to reflect the number of shares of HyOrc issued in the reverse acquisition.

For periods before the reverse acquisition, the stockholders’ equity of the combined entity is presented on the basis of the historical equity of SRE before the acquisition, retroactively recast to reflect the number of shares received in the acquisition.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of the Company’s financial statements in conformity with U.S.GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets and liabilities; the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods covered and certain amounts disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. These estimates are based on information available through the date of the issuance of the financial statements and actual results could differ from those estimates. Areas requiring significant estimates and assumptions by the Company include, but are not limited to:

●provisions for income taxes and related valuation allowances and tax uncertainties

●business combinations and purchase price allocations

●recoverability of long-lived assets and contract assets and their related estimated lives

●evaluation of goodwill for impairment

●accruals for estimated liabilities

●net-realizable value of inventory and credit loss on accounts receivable and contract assets.

Comprehensive Loss

Comprehensive loss includes net loss as well as other changes in stockholders’ equity that result from transactions and economic events other than those with stockholders. There was no difference between net loss and comprehensive loss presented in the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.

Segment Reporting

The Company’s chief operating decision-maker is its Chief Executive Officer, who, together with the Board of Directors, is accountable for overall strategy, resource allocation, and operational oversight. The CODM evaluates financial performance and makes key decisions based on consolidated financial information. There are no individual segment managers who are held accountable for discrete business activities, and the Company does not manage operations or allocate resources based on distinct business lines or geographic components. Accordingly, the Company operates as a single reportable and operating segment for the purposes of financial reporting under ASC 280 - Segment Reporting.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, certificates of deposits and money market funds that are readily convertible into cash, all with original maturity dates of three months or less.

Concentration of Credit Risks

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and receivables. The Company places its cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions.

Customer Concentration Risk

For the year ended December 31, 2024, the entire sales pertained to only one customer. The Company’s reliance on this major customer presents a concentration risk. Loss of this customer or a significant reduction in their order could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial performance. The Company continues to focus on efforts to diversify its customer base to mitigate such risks. There was no revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Related Parties

Parties are considered to be related to the Company if the parties, directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, control, are controlled by, or are under common control with the Company. Related parties also include principal owners of the Company, its management, members of the immediate families of principal owners of the Company and its management and other parties with which the Company may deal with if one party controls or can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the other to an extent that one of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests. The Company follows ASC 850, Related Party Disclosures, for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party transactions. All transactions are recorded at arm’s length prices, reflecting the fair value of the goods or services exchanged.

Income Taxes

The Company uses the liability method of accounting for income taxes as set forth in ASC 740, Income Taxes. Under the liability method, deferred taxes are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates expected to be in effect during the years in which the basis differences reverse. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is unlikely that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company assesses its income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon our evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. In accordance with ASC 740-10, for those tax positions where there is a greater than 50% likelihood that a tax benefit will be sustained, our policy will be to record the largest amount of tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where there is less than 50% likelihood that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit will be recognized in the financial statements.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. A hierarchy has been established for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability and are developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company’s assumptions of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best information available in the circumstances. The financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities are classified based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The hierarchy is presented down into three levels based on the reliability of the inputs.

Level 1 Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 Unobservable pricing inputs that are generally less observable from objective sources, such as discounted cash flow models or valuations.

The carrying amounts of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair value because of the short-term nature of these instruments.

Accounts Receivable, Net

Accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. Accounts receivable are the dues from customers and are shown net of applicable reserves for doubtful accounts as shown on the face of the balance sheet. There were no accounts that had been placed on non-accrual status. The allowance for doubtful accounts has been estimated by management based on historical experience, current market trends and, for larger customer accounts, their assessment of the ability of the customers to pay outstanding balances. Past due balances and other higher risk amounts are reviewed individually for collectability. Changes in circumstances relating to the collectability of accounts receivable may result in the need to increase or decrease the allowance for doubtful accounts in the future.

The allowance for bad debt recognized was $512,815 and $0 within general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Property, Plant and Equipment, Net

Property, plant and equipment, net (“PP&E”) is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization and any accumulated impairment losses. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line method over the assets’ estimated useful lives.

PP&E consists of unproved properties and, thus, the costs associated with such properties are not subject to depletion. The Company historically has acquired unproved properties by purchasing individual or small groups of leases directly from mineral owners which leases historically have not been subject to specified drilling projects. Capitalized costs associated with unproved properties, which includes leases that have expired or have been deemed uneconomic, are fully impaired.

Major renewals and improvements are capitalized. Replacements, maintenance, and repairs, which do not significantly improve or extend the useful life of the assets, are expensed when incurred.

Upon the sale or retirement of assets, costs and the related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is included in the results of operations.

The Company evaluates its long-lived assets or asset groups for indicators of possible impairment by determining whether there were any triggering events that could impact the Company’s assets. If events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable the Company performs a comparison of the carrying amount to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by such asset or asset group. Should an impairment exist, the impairment loss is measured based on the excess carrying value of the asset over the asset’s fair value generally determined by estimates of future discounted cash flows.

Revenue Recognition

The Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606 upon inception.

To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that the Company determines are within the scope of ASC 606, the Company performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligation(s) in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligation(s) in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer. At contract inception, once the contract was determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, the Company assessed the goods or services promised within each contract and determined those that were performance obligations, and assessed whether each promised good or service was distinct. The Company then recognizes as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied.

A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer and is the unit of account in ASC 606.

PFBT Agreement with BGI

SRE and Biliran Geothermal, Inc. (BGI) entered into a 25-year Project Funding, Build and Transfer Agreement (PFBT Agreement) in June 2021 for a 50 MW geothermal facility at Sitio Pulang Yuta, Brgy. Cabibihan, Caibiran, Biliran Province, Philippines. Under this arrangement:

●SRE finances, designs, constructs, installs and commissions the geothermal power plant in phases, beginning with a 2 MW module commissioned in September 2023. ●SRE also finances and upgrades the existing 13.2 kV distribution lines of Biliran Electric Cooperative (Bileco) to evacuate energy to the national grid. ●Upon final acceptance, SRE Power provides operation and maintenance (O&M) and technical support services over the 25-year term. ●Revenue comprises fixed construction and commissioning fees, reimbursements for agreed costs, and a variable share of electricity generation proceeds, all invoiced monthly per the contractual formula.

The Company identified the PFBT Agreement constitutes a single, enforceable contract. The distinct performance obligations under the Agreement are as follows:

●Design, construction, installation and commissioning of plant modules ●O&M and technical support services during operations ●Revenue share from daily electricity generation

Transaction price for the agreement consists of fixed fees for construction and commissioning, variable consideration based on BGI’s monthly electricity sales share and reimbursements of agreed costs. Estimates of variable consideration are included only to the extent that significant reversals are not probable.

Construction & Commissioning: Revenue is recognized at the point in time when the module passes commissioning tests and BGI has practical acceptance evidence.

O&M & Technical Support: Revenue is recognized over time using an input method (e.g., labor hours, machine- hours) as support services are rendered.

Electricity-Generation Share: Recognize over time on an output basis tied to daily meter readings of power delivered.

For the year ended December 31, 2024, the revenue recognized of $617,115 comprised only of the O&M & technical services provided to BGI.

Other Non-Current Assets

Other non-current assets represent capitalized costs incurred for the construction of geothermal plant, which is in progress, that is constructed and commissioned by SRE under the PFBT Agreement (Refer to Revenue Recognition).

BGI will own all equipment, machinery, supplies, facilities, and designs that are supplied, installed, or utilized for the Geothermal Facility. However, BGI agrees to create a Lien over these assets in favor of SRE. This Lien serves as security to ensure repayment for the work that SRE performs on the Geothermal Facility. The Lien will not extend to Bileco Lines because The Bileco Lines are owned by Bileco, not BGI. The parties acknowledge this distinction, ensuring BGI does not impose financial claims over infrastructure it does not control. This provision protects SRE’s financial interests while clarifying ownership limitations regarding the distribution lines. Accordingly, the said asset is recognized and presented under Other non-current assets for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.

Considering the persistent grid instability in April 2024 of the equipment which resulted in over 250 grid trips that caused progressive stress and wear to critical equipment and the legal dispute with BGI as described in Note 2 below, the management assessed that the qualitative indicators for impairment existed and hence a qualitative assessment was performed. Based on the management’s judgement, the Company has recognized an impairment loss to the extent of around $300,000 in the statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2024. Accordingly, the same was reduced from the carrying value of the non-current assets and the net carrying value of other non-current assets amount to $2,700,000 as of December 31, 2024.

Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities

Accounts payable represents dues to vendors against whom operating expenses are incurred.

Business Combinations

The Company accounts for acquisitions in which it obtains control of one or more businesses as a business combination. The purchase price of the acquired businesses is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over those fair values is recognized as goodwill. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company may record adjustments, in the period in which they are determined, to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. If the assets acquired are not a business, the Company accounts for the transaction or other event as an asset acquisition. Under both methods, the Company recognizes the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquired entity. In addition, for transactions that are business combinations, the Company evaluates the existence of goodwill or a gain from a bargain purchase.

Goodwill

Goodwill is an asset representing the excess cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations. In accordance with Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350), goodwill is not amortized but is tested annually for impairment or on an interim basis when indicators of potential impairment exist. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. The Company’s reporting units discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews the operating results. For purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the applicable reporting units based on the reporting structure.

The Company has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Qualitative factors assessed for each of the applicable reporting units include, but are not limited to, changes in macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, discount rates, competitive environments and financial performance of the reporting units. If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, a quantitative test is required.

The Company also has the option to proceed directly to the quantitative test. Under the quantitative impairment test, the estimated fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the carrying value of the reporting unit including goodwill exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge equal to the excess would be recognized, up to a maximum amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Management can resume the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period for any reporting unit.

For December 2024, management performed a qualitative impairment assessment of our reporting units, of which there were no indications that it was more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units were less than their respective carrying values. As such, a quantitative impairment test was not required, and no impairment was recognized during the year ended December 31, 2024.

Earnings (Loss) per Common Share

Net earnings or loss per share is computed by dividing net income or loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, excluding shares subject to redemption or forfeiture. The Company presents basic and diluted net earnings or loss per share. Diluted net earnings or loss per share reflect the actual weighted average of common shares issued and outstanding during the period, adjusted for potentially dilutive securities outstanding. Potentially dilutive securities are excluded from the computation of the diluted net loss per share if their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.

The financial statements of the combined entity reflect the equity of the HyOrc including the equity interests issued as part of the reverse acquisition. As a result, EPS is calculated on the basis of the capital structure of HyOrc. In line with ASC 805-40-45-2(d), the following is considered:

In calculating the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding (the denominator of the earnings-per- share [EPS] calculation) during the period in which the reverse acquisition occurs:

a. The number of common shares outstanding from the beginning of the period to the acquisition date is computed on the basis of the weighted-average number of common shares of SRE outstanding during the period multiplied by the exchange ratio established in the agreement.

b. The number of common shares outstanding from the acquisition date to the end of the period is the actual number of common shares of the HyOrc outstanding during that period.

The basic EPS for each comparative period before the acquisition date presented in the financial statements following a reverse acquisition is calculated by dividing (a) by (b):

a. The income of the SRE attributable to common shareholders in each of those periods.

b. SRE’s weighted-average number of common shares outstanding multiplied by the exchange ratio established in the agreement.

The issued and outstanding common shares of SRE through the acquisition date was 1,000,000 and the exchange ratio established in the agreement was 655.36, thereby resulting in the pro-rated weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the purposes of computing EPS to be 382,301,649. Weighted average common shares of Hyorc outstanding from acquisition through December 31, 2024 was 303,414,008. This resulted in the weighted-average total number of common shares for computing EPS to be 685,715,657 for the year ended December 31,2024.

The weighted-average number of common shares multiplied by the exchange ratio established in the agreement resulted in 655,374,256 common shares for 2023.

Intangible Assets

Intangible assets primarily consist of patents owned by SRE which have been granted by the Indian government due to work done at the Indian R&D centre. HyOrc is expanding patent coverage with the application process primarily in the USA, EU, Japan through existing bilateral and multilateral cooperation agreements. These patents were acquired through an assignment agreement entered by SRE in May 2024 through which SRE acquired ownership interests in the patents including utility models and design patents and registrations and applications assigned by the Assignor.

The consideration terms were agreed in such a way that the Assignor is entitled to 5% of all the shares received by SRE upon SRE achieving a reverse takeover of a publicly traded company whose shares are traded on the OTC markets or similar stock exchanges.

Accordingly, the Company issued 32,768,712 common shares of SRE as the consideration for the acquisition of the patents which represented 5% of the shares acquired by the owners of SRE through the reverse acquisition with the Company at a value of $0.11 per common share. (Refer to Note 3) resulting in a total consideration of

$3,604,588.

The patents have an indefinite useful life because it is expected to contribute to cash flows indefinitely and the associated costs of renewal are not significant. The patents are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired in accordance with ASC 350-30-35-18. For December 2024, management performed a qualitative impairment assessment, of which there were no indications that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the patents were less than their respective carrying values. As such, a quantitative test was not required, and no impairment was recognized during the year ended December 31, 2024.

In connection with the reverse acquisition, the Company identified intangible assets, which are solely customer relationships (refer to Note 3). For December 2024, management performed a qualitative impairment assessment of these intangible assets, of which there were indications that it is more likely than not that the fair value of these intangible assets units were less than their respective carrying values. As such, a quantitative impairment test was performed and the intangible assets were fully impaired with a corresponding impairment loss recognized in the Statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2024.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

The Company continually monitors events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of long-lived assets (including other non-current assets) may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances are present, the Company assesses the recoverability of long-lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the total of the future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets, the Company recognizes an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value less costs to sell.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

The Company has implemented all new relevant accounting pronouncements that are in effect through the date of these financial statements. The pronouncements did not have any material impact on the financial statements unless otherwise disclosed., and the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.

ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, establishes incremental disaggregation of income tax disclosures pertaining to the effective tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, and requires prospective application with the option to apply it retrospectively. We intend to adopt this standard in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2025. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this standard on our disclosures.

ASU 2024-03, Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses, requires disaggregation of specific expense categories in the notes to the financial statements and a qualitative description of the remaining expense amounts not separately disaggregated. This standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and requires prospective application with the option to apply it retrospectively. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this standard on our disclosures and we intend to adopt this as and when applicable.

NOTE 2. GOING CONCERN

The Company has a net loss of $1,632,163 for the year ended December 31, 2024 and an accumulated deficit of $8,216,241 as of December 31, 2024.

SRE is the operator of the 2MW geothermal power plant in Biliran Philippines and is entitled to 60% of the operating profits from the project for the lifetime of the project which is expected to be 25 years.

Biliran Geothermal Project (2MW) – Operational Status as of December 31, 2024

As of December 31, 2024, the 2MW geothermal power plant in Biliran remained offline and non-operational due to infrastructure damage. The project began experiencing persistent grid instability in April 2024, resulting in over 250 grid trips that caused progressive stress and wear to critical equipment. On October 05, 2024, the plant was taken offline following a technical inspection that revealed accumulated damage to key systems, making continued operation unsafe. Shortly after this shutdown, Typhoon Kristine-Trami struck the region and caused additional physical damage to the facility. Despite the existence of an insurance policy intended to cover such events, we have not received confirmation that a claim has been activated, and we have not received cooperation from the project counterparties responsible for managing the insurance process.

The company continues to engage stakeholders and explore legal and commercial remedies to protect our position, recover losses, and restore the project’s operational viability.

The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern in the next twelve months following the date the financial statements are available to be issued is dependent upon its ability to produce revenues and/or obtain financing sufficient to meet current and future obligations and deploy such to produce profitable operating results.

Management Plans

Management has evaluated these conditions and plans to generate revenues and raise capital as needed to satisfy its capital needs.

While uncertainties remain with respect to the timing of insurance recovery and revenue realization, management is reasonably certain in the Company’s ability to meet its operational and financial obligations over the next twelve months through a combination of funding, asset deployment, and resolution of existing claims but it cannot provide assurances that it will be successful in doing so.

These circumstances raise substantial doubt as to the ability of the Company to meet its obligations as they come due. If it is unable to obtain sufficient amount of additional capital, it may be required to reduce the scope of its planned development. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from these uncertainties.

Since the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company has successfully raised post-balance sheet capital through share issuances and continues to actively pursue funding opportunities to support operations and growth. In parallel, the Company has made strategic progress in hydrogen engine development, secured new business opportunities in the UK, EU, and India, and commenced ISO certification to facilitate future deployments in regulated sectors such as rail and energy. (Refer to Note 8 for subsequent events)

The Company has evaluated whether there are certain conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued.

NOTE 3. REVERSE ACQUISITION

The Company evaluated the acquisition of SRE pursuant to ASC 805 and ASU 2017-01, Topic 805, Business Combinations. As described in Note 1, we have identified the Company as the legal acquirer, as it is the entity that issued securities. Comparatively, we have identified SRE as the legal acquiree, the entity whose equity interests are acquired in line with ASC 805-40 – Reverse Acquisitions.

Accordingly, the acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred by SRE was based on the number of equity interests SRE would have had to issue to give the owners of HyOrc the same percentage equity interest in the combined entity that results from the reverse acquisition.

The acquisition method of accounting requires, among other things, that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination be measured at their estimated respective fair values as of the closing date of the acquisition. Goodwill recognized in connection with this transaction represents primarily the potential economic benefits that the Company believes may arise from the acquisition. In the reverse acquisition described above, HyOrc’s assets and liabilities were measured in accordance with the guidance in ASC 805 on Business Combinations and Goodwill is measured as the excess of fair value of consideration effectively transferred by SRE, the accounting acquirer over the fair value of the net assets of HyOrc, the accounting acquiree on the acquisition date.

The following table summarizes the preliminary purchase price allocation of HyOrc:

Total Customer relationship - Intangibles $932,088 Goodwill 15,755,344 Purchase price consideration effectively transferred $16,687,432

The fair value consideration effectively transferred was determined based on the number of common stock which SRE would have had to issue to the owners of HyOrc at the fair value per share of SRE on the date of acquisition to provide the same ratio of ownership (90%) in the combined entity as a result of the reverse acquisition.

Pursuant to the reverse acquisition, the Company engaged an independent third-party valuation specialist to determine the fair value per share of SRE which as determined using the fair value of net assets as on the acquisition date. Given the limited operations of HyOrc in the period preceding the acquisition, the fair value per common share of SRE was considered to be more reliable and reflects the economic substance of the consideration effectively transferred.

The fair value of net assets of SRE as on the acquisition date is as follows:

Total Property, plant and equipment, net $- Other intangible assets 150,000,000 Cash and cash equivalents 347,058 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities (160,169) Fair value of net assets $

150,186,889

Number of SRE shares outstanding on the acquisition date 1,000,000 Fair Value per share on the acquisition date $150.19

SRE’s balance sheet includes a geothermal plant, which is classified as Other non-current assets. The fair value of this asset was determined to be $15,000,000 by an independent third-party valuation at the time of acquisition. However, management has concluded that this fair value should not be factored into the overall business valuation of SRE. This decision is based on the fact that the plant is not yet fully commissioned and therefore does not contribute to the company’s business operations. Furthermore, the terms of the agreement with BGI, along with the rights BGI exercises over the asset, limit SRE’s control and ability to derive economic significant benefits from the plant. This rationale aligns with the principles of U.S. GAAP, where the value of an asset in a business valuation is tied to its operational contribution and the economic benefits it provides, not merely its standalone fair value.

SRE would have had to issue 111,111 shares to the owners of HyOrc to maintain the 90% ownership in the combined entity which effectively would have made the total common stock issued and outstanding of SRE to be 1,111,111 as of December 31, 2024.

HyOrc had 72,819,362 common shares issued and outstanding of par value $0.001 each prior to the closing of the reverse acquisition. Further, SRE shareholders received 655,374,256 common shares of HyOrc as the consideration for the share exchange.

Accordingly, the equity structure in the financial statements reflect the sum of SRE’s issued equity immediately before the reverse acquisition, and the fair value of the hypothetical consideration effectively transferred. The equity structure (i.e., the number and type of equity interests issued) reflects the equity structure of HyOrc. However, the balance is adjusted to reflect the par value of the outstanding shares of HyOrc, including the number of shares issued in the reverse acquisition and the difference is recognized as an adjustment to the Additional paid-in capital. For periods before the reverse acquisition, the stockholders’ equity of the combined entity is presented on the basis of the historical equity of the SRE before the acquisition, retroactively recast to reflect the number of shares received by SRE in the acquisition.

Goodwill is primarily attributable to the go-to-market synergies that are expected to arise as a result of the acquisition and other intangible assets that qualify for separate recognition. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes.

The results of HyOrc have been included in the consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date.

NOTE 4. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, NET

Property, plant and equipment consist of the following:

December 31, 2024 2023 Plant and Equipment – unproved properties 60,000 60,000 Property, plant and equipment, gross 60,000 60,000 Less: Accumulated depreciation and amortization (60,000) (60,000) Property, plant and equipment, net $- $-

Depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2024, and 2023 amounted to $0 and $0, respectively.

The unproved property interests comprise the consideration paid in March 2017 for Symba America Oil & Gas’s working interest in an oil well near Ganado, Texas. Having since ceased oil extraction activities, management performed a qualitative impairment assessment in accordance with ASC 360-10-35. That assessment indicated that the fair value of these unproved properties was negligible or nominal; accordingly, the entire carrying amount has been written down to $0.

NOTE 5. INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Intangible assets consist of the following:

December 31, 2024 2023 Customer relationships – reverse acquisition $932,088 $- Patents 3,604,558 - 4,536,646 - Accumulated impairment loss (932,088) Accumulated amortization - - Intangible assets, net $3,604,558 $0

NOTE 6. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

From time to time, the Company is involved in legal proceedings arising from the normal course of business activities. The Company, in conjunction with its legal counsel, assesses the need to record a liability for litigation or loss contingencies. A liability is recorded when and if it is determined that such a liability for litigation or loss contingencies is both probable and estimable.

Although the results of legal proceedings and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company is not currently a party to any legal proceedings, which would, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, cash flows, or financial position except as described in Note 2.

NOTE 7. INCOME TAXES

Deferred taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial statement and income tax purposes. The differences relate primarily to net operating loss carry forwards. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company did not record a current or deferred income tax expense or benefit due to current and historical losses incurred by the Company.

The Company has evaluated its income tax positions and has determined that it does not have any uncertain tax positions. The Company will recognize interest and penalties related to any uncertain tax positions through its income tax expense.

The Company is not presently subject to any income tax audit in any taxing jurisdiction, though its 2022-2023 tax years remain subject to examination by U.S. federal and state jurisdictions.

NOTE 8. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

In the first quarter of 2025, the Company issued 11,000,000 common shares and raised around $110,000 through private share placements to individual investors. The Company has also commenced formal procedures for ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 certification to support manufacturing and environmental compliance for upcoming contracts.

The Company has submitted technical proposals to Banaras Locomotive Works (BLW) under Indian Railways for hydrogen retrofit deployment and has advanced few methanol project initiatives in Portugal and UK, and hydrogen retrofitting engagements with local operators and OEM partners. No other events have occurred subsequent to the balance sheet date and through the date of these financial statements that would require adjustment to or disclosure in the financial information referred to above. Management has evaluated subsequent events through July 31, 2025, the date the financial statements were available to be issued.

We are providing this letter in connection with your audit of the Consolidated Balance Sheets, Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss, Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity (Deficit) and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of HyOrc Corporation. (referred as “Consolidated Financial Statements”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 and for the period January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024 and January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023 for the purpose of expressing an opinion as to whether the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows of HyOrc Corporation in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We confirm that we are responsible for the fair presentation in the consolidated financial statements of financial position, results of operations, and cash flows in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

Certain representations in this letter are described as being limited to matters that are material. Items are considered material, regardless of size, if they involve an omission or misstatement of accounting information that, in the light of surrounding circumstances, makes it probable that the judgment of a reasonable person relying on the information would be changed or influenced by the omission or misstatement. We confirm, to the best of our knowledge and belief, as of July 29, 2025, the following representations made to you during your audit(s).

1. The consolidated financial statements referred to above are fairly presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

2. We have made available to you all—

(a) Financial records and related data, including the names of all related parties and all relationships and transactions with related parties.

(b) Minutes of the meetings of stockholders, directors, and committees of directors, or summaries of actions of recent meetings for which minutes have not yet been prepared.

3. There have been no communications from regulatory agencies concerning noncompliance with or deficiencies in financial reporting practices.

4. There are no material transactions that have not been properly recorded in the accounting records underlying the consolidated financial statements.

5. We believe that the effects of the uncorrected financial statement misstatements summarized in the accompanying schedule are immaterial, both individually and in the aggregate, to the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole.

6. We acknowledge our responsibility for the design and implementation of programs and controls to prevent and detect fraud.

7. We have no knowledge of any fraud or suspected fraud affecting the entity involving—

(a) Management,

(b) Employees who have significant roles in internal control, or

(c) Others where the fraud could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.

8. We have no knowledge of any allegations of fraud or suspected fraud affecting the entity received in communications from employees, former employees, analysts, regulators, short sellers, or others.

9. The company has no plans or intentions that may materially affect the carrying value or classification of assets and liabilities.

10. The following have been properly recorded or disclosed in the consolidated financial statements wherever applicable:

(a) There are no Related-party transactions involved, including sales, purchases, loans, transfers, leasing arrangements, and guarantees, and amounts receivable from or payable to related parties.

(b) Guarantees, whether written or oral, under which the company is contingently liable.

(c) Significant estimates and material concentrations known to management that are required to be disclosed.

Significant estimates are estimates at the balance sheet date that could change materially within the next year. Concentrations refer to volumes of business, revenues, available sources of supply, or markets or geographic areas for which events could occur that would significantly disrupt normal finances within the next year.

11. There are no—

(a) Violations or possible violations of laws or regulations whose effects should be considered for disclosure in the consolidated financial statements or as a basis for recording a loss contingency.

(b) Unasserted claims or assessments that our lawyer has advised us are probable of assertion and must be disclosed in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies.

(c) Other liabilities or gain or loss contingencies that are required to be accrued or disclosed by FASB Statement No. 5.

(d) Side agreements or other arrangements (either written or oral) that have not been disclosed to you.

12. The company has satisfactory title to all owned assets, and there are no liens or encumbrances on such assets, nor has any asset been pledged as collateral except as disclosed.

13. To the best of our knowledge and belief, we make the following representations regarding Other Non-Current Assets and related impairment, as disclosed in Note 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024:

☐ The balance of Other Non-Current Assets represents capitalized costs incurred for the construction of the geothermal facility under the Power Facility Build-Transfer Agreement between BGI and SRE.

☐ Under that Agreement, BGI retains title to all equipment, machinery, supplies, facilities and proprietary designs, and has granted SRE a lien on those assets (excluding the Bileco distribution lines, which are owned by Bileco) as security for payment of SRE’s construction and commissioning services.

☐ During April 2024, persistent grid instability resulted in over 250 grid trips that progressively stressed and wore critical equipment and gave rise to a legal dispute with BGI (see Note 2).

☐ Management concluded that these events constituted qualitative indicators of impairment and, accordingly, recorded an impairment loss of $300,000 in the year ended December 31, 2024.

☐ As a result of that impairment, the net carrying value of Other Non-Current Assets was reduced to $2,700,000 as of December 31, 2024.

☐ All material facts and circumstances related to the lien arrangement, grid-trip events, legal dispute and impairment decision have been disclosed to you and are reflected appropriately in the consolidated financial statements.

14. The company has complied with all aspects of contractual agreements that would have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements in the event of non-compliance.

15. To the best of our knowledge and belief, we confirm that the geothermal plant recorded under Other Non-Current Assets at a fair value of $15,000,000 determined by an independent third-party valuation as of the acquisition date has not been included in SRE’s overall business valuation. Management’s conclusion rests on two primary factors: first, the plant is not yet fully commissioned and therefore does not contribute to SRE’s operating cash flows; second, the Build-Transfer Agreement with BGI grants BGI title and certain control rights (including a lien on plant assets and the right to direct commissioning timing), which materially restrict SRE’s ability to direct the use of the asset and to derive its economic benefits. This treatment is consistent with U.S. GAAP, under which asset values incorporated in a business valuation must reflect an asset’s operational contribution and its capacity to generate future economic benefits, rather than its standalone fair value. We did not include this fair value of the noncurrent asset in the computation of goodwill.

16. We agree with the findings of specialists in evaluating Existence and valuation of the Intellectual Property Portfolio and have adequately considered the qualifications of the specialist in determining the amounts and disclosures used in the consolidated financial statements and underlying accounting records.

We did not give or cause any instructions to be given to specialists with respect to the values or amounts derived in an attempt to bias their work, and we are not otherwise aware of any matters that have had an impact on the independence or objectivity of the specialists.

17. We represent that the inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value and valuation allowances are made accurately for the inventories whose net realizable value is lower than the cost. Net realizable value is estimated by the management experience and expertise.

18. We further represent that the net realizable value of the inventories has been considered based on the estimated selling prices after deducting the estimated selling expenses of those inventories in the ordinarycourse of business. These are estimated considering the present condition of the inventory along with the contracts entered into by the company.

19. We are currently maintaining inventory records in Excel sheets as part of our early-stage accounting system. However, we have initiated a migration to QuickBooks, which will enable more automated and structured inventory tracking",http://www.streetinsider.com/images/silogo-new.png,N,,2025-11-19 15:56:44.474110

The NGO, through its shipbuilder Freire Shipyard, selected Andorra, Spain-headquartered marine battery manufacturer AYK Energy to supply a 3-MWh Aires+ battery system that has been recently approved by classification society DNV.

Greenpeace said the 75-m vessel, which is due for delivery in 2027, will be the most environmentally advanced ship in Greenpeace International’s fleet, and is being designed to operate with near-zero emissions. The vessel’s propulsion will be generated by a combination of two electric drive propellers as well as 1,746 m2 of sails. Solar panels and the AYK battery packs will provide supplemental power for the vessel. Greenpeace International said the vessel will be as close to fossil fuel-free as possible at the launch, and that it is designed to transition to 100% fossil fuel-free power as soon as technically possible.

In September 2024, Hexagon Purus Maritime received a €2.5M (US$2.8M) purchase order from the shipyard for a compressed hydrogen fuel system for the vessel. The vessel is expected to use hydrogen and e-methanol power systems among its various propulsion technologies.

AYK chief executive Chris Kruger has been active in the marine battery technology industry after moving into the maritime sector from the electric car industry. According to AYK, Mr Kruger developed the battery for the first hybrid propulsion ferry, Prinsesse Benedikte, and the first fully electric ferry, Ampere, in 2012. Now based in Andorra, Mr Kruger established AYK Energy in 2018, building its first factory in 2023 in China ""to be close to the centre of the battery industry supply chain which he said is 10 years ahead of Europe in China,"" according to AYK.

Freire shipyard laid the keel for the vessel in July 2025. Greenpeace said it ordered the new vessel to replace Esperanza which had reached the end of its working life.

""Greenpeace was founded on the ocean, when the first Greenpeace crew set out in an old fishing boat to stop a nuclear weapons test in the Aleutian Islands in 1971. Ordinary people set sail with the belief they had a responsibility to make the world a more peaceful place for all of us,"" the organisation said.

""Ships have been at the heart of Greenpeace’s campaigns ever since. From the jungle waterways of Indonesia to the wilderness of Antarctica, we are able to confront environmental destruction in places otherwise impossible to reach.

Esperanza, one of our three oceangoing ships, has just reached the end of its working life after 20 years of service. Unless we replace it, our ability to campaign at sea will suffer.""",https://dvzpv6x5302g1.cloudfront.net/AcuCustom/Sitename/DAM/184/Greenpeace-newbuild-NC737-Freire-Shipyard1_Main.png,N,,2025-11-19 14:56:47.559746

The regulatory push for maritime decarbonisation is certainly influencing turbocharger design at Napier.
Best practices for turbocharged marine engines, as advocated by Napier, revolve around holistic system integration and proactive management.
As maritime decarbonisation gathers pace, Napier’s turbochargers will not only power ships but propel the industry toward a sustainable horizon, balancing environmental imperatives with economic viability.
As the maritime industry navigates towards net-zero, Napier sees turbochargers as enablers rather than mere accessories.","Napier Turbochargers has been a stalwart in the marine industry for over six decades, producing more than 60,000 units that power vessels across global oceans. As part of Wabtec Corp since 2013, the company has honed its expertise in high-efficiency turbochargers for marine propulsion, emphasising durability in harsh environments and compatibility with diverse fuels.

While the drive is still towards maritime decarbonisation, driven by the changing and constantly updated IMO regulations mandating reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, Napier is forging ahead adapting turbocharger designs to embrace the range of potential low- and zero-carbon fuels like natural gas, biofuels, and hydrogen blends. This is easier said than done, because until there is a clear leader in the ‘alternative’ fuel race, there are quite a few bases to be covered.

The regulatory push for maritime decarbonisation is certainly influencing turbocharger design at Napier. Traditional marine diesel engines, reliant on heavy fuel oil and marine diesel oil, are giving way to alternatives that demand turbochargers capable of handling variable combustion characteristics without compromising performance. Napier’s latest developments, such as the NT Series, exemplify this evolution. Launched with market-leading efficiencies, these turbochargers incorporate advanced aerodynamic profiles that optimise air intake across a broader range of engine loads.

“We specialise in retrofitting older engines to align with current standards”

During a recent discussion with Napier, it was clear that continuous developments are ongoing to constantly improve the company’s offerings. For instance, in response to the uptake of low-carbon fuels, Napier has engineered units that maintain high-pressure ratios even with fuels of lower calorific value, ensuring engines operate at peak efficiency.

Napier business development executive, Sam Tonks, said: “Alongside our core expertise in supplying OEMs with cutting-edge turbochargers that meet both current and future emissions regulations, we also specialise in retrofitting older engines to align with current standards as well as provide benefits of fuel saving. This approach helps engine operators avoid the high costs of investing in entirely new technologies, significantly reducing their overall cost of ownership while ensuring compliance and performance.”

Mr Tonks said Napier collaborates with OEM engine manufacturers to advance “turbocharger technologies that maximise combustion efficiency and emissions control across alternative fuel platforms such as methanol, ammonia, and LNG.” He said the company’s systems are designed to deliver precise air management and robust thermal performance, enabling significant reductions in NOx, SOx, and CO2 emissions. “These developments support compliance with IMO Tier III and emerging regulatory frameworks, while allowing retrofit solutions that extend the lifecycle and environmental viability of existing marine engines,” added Mr Tonks.

One of the main driving forces for Napier is to enable a seamless transition to sustainable fuels while reducing fuel consumption by up to 10-15% in retrofitted systems. This design flexibility addresses the challenge of fluctuating fuel quality, a common issue in global shipping routes, by incorporating corrosion-resistant materials and enhanced sealing systems to prevent leaks and maintain integrity over longer periods. Another potential development down the line may be the development of fuel cells, where only the compressor side of a turbocharger would be required to drive the air across the fuel-cell pack, so an electrically driven turbocharger might be the answer.

Efficiency is central to Napier’s strategy, and by integrating computational fluid dynamics (CFD) in design processes, the company has reduced energy losses in compressor and turbine stages, allowing engines to achieve lower specific fuel consumption (SFC). In marine applications, where vessels operate under varying loads, from idling in ports to full throttle at sea, this translates to significant energy savings. Napier’s retrofitting programmes further amplify these benefits; upgrading older turbochargers with NT1 or NT2 models can extend engine life by 20-30%, improve power output, and cut emissions through better combustion control.

For example, in power generation sets aboard ships, these upgrades support dual-fuel operations, blending HFO with natural gas to lower carbon intensity. The result: vessels comply with Energy Efficiency Design Index standards while minimising operational costs, aligning with the industry’s goal of net-zero by 2050.

Best practices for turbocharged marine engines, as advocated by Napier, revolve around holistic system integration and proactive management. First, operators should prioritise fuel quality monitoring to prevent contaminants from eroding turbine blades, a risk amplified with biofuels. Regular inspections using borescopes can detect early wear, but Napier’s good practice recommendation is to adopt variable speed operations that match turbocharger output to engine demand, avoiding surge or choke conditions that waste energy.

Supporting ammonia

Napier’s trajectory is one of innovation amid uncertainty. With investments in hybrid turbocharger concepts, combining electric assist for low-load efficiency, the company is poised to support emerging zero-carbon technologies like ammonia-fuelled engines.

Challenges remain, such as material compatibility with corrosive alternative fuels, but Napier’s collaborative approach with engine OEMs promises solutions. As maritime decarbonisation gathers pace, Napier’s turbochargers will not only power ships but propel the industry toward a sustainable horizon, balancing environmental imperatives with economic viability.

As the maritime industry navigates towards net-zero, Napier sees turbochargers as enablers rather than mere accessories. They will of course, continue innovating for fuel flexibility and efficiency, collaborating on hybrid systems or hydrogen applications. Partnerships with major OEM’s and Future R&D may focus on digital twins for predictive maintenance and materials for extreme conditions.

Yet challenges remain. Regulatory flux and supply chain issues mean working with engine makers, shipowners, and regulators is key to accelerating decarbonisation.

Napier’s story is one of adaptation, turning a century-old technology into a cornerstone of modern sustainability. As vessels worldwide adopt greener fuels, and endeavour to reduce emissions that are harmful to people and the environment, companies like Napier ensure the journey is efficient, reliable, and environmentally sound. It is a challenging environment, but one that innovative companies like Napier revel in and are stepping up to that challenge.",https://dvzpv6x5302g1.cloudfront.net/AcuCustom/Sitename/DAM/183/NT156_1webzhgf1_Main.png,N,,2025-11-19 13:57:34.174695

Canada has spent the past decade pursuing climate policies that promised environmental transformation but delivered economic decline. Ottawa’s fixation on net-zero targets – first under Justin Trudeau and now under Prime Minister Mark Carney – has meant staggering public expenditures, resource project cancellations and rising energy costs, all while failing to

reduce the country’s dependence on fossil fuels. Now, as key international actors reassess the net-zero doctrine, Canada stands increasingly alone in imposing heavy burdens for negligible gains.

The Trudeau government launched its agenda in 2015 by signing the Paris Climate Agreement aimed at limiting the forecast increase in global average temperature to 1.5°C by the end of the century. It followed the next year with the Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change that imposed more than 50 measures on the economy, key among them a

carbon “pricing” regime – Liberal-speak for taxes on every Canadian citizen and industry. Then came the 2030 Emissions Reduction Plan, committing Canada to cut greenhouse gas emissions to 40 percent below 2005 levels by 2030, and to achieve net-zero by 2050. And then the “On-Farm Climate Action Fund,” the “Green and Inclusive Community Buildings Program” and the “Green Municipal Fund.”

It’s a staggering list of nation-impoverishing subsidies, taxes and restrictions, made worse by regulatory measures that hammered the energy industry. The Trudeau government cancelled the fully-permitted Northern Gateway pipeline, killing more than $1 billion in private investment and stranding hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of crude oil in the ground. The

Energy East project collapsed after Ottawa declined to challenge Quebec’s political obstruction, cutting off a route that could have supplied Atlantic refineries and European markets. Natural gas developers fared no better: 11 of 12 proposed liquefied natural gas export terminals were abandoned amid federal regulatory delays and policy uncertainty. Only a single LNG project in Kitimat, B.C., survived.

None of this has had the desired effect. Between Trudeau’s election in 2015 and 2023, fossil fuels’ share of Canada’s energy supply actually increased from 75 to 77 percent. As for saving the world, or even making some contribution towards doing so, Canada contributes just 1.5 percent of global GHG emissions. If our emissions went to zero tomorrow, the emissions

growth from China and India would make that up in just a few weeks.

And this green fixation has been massively expensive. Two newly released studies by the Fraser Institute found that Ottawa and the four biggest provinces have either spent or foregone a mind-numbing $158 billion to create just 68,000 “clean” jobs – an eye-watering cost of over $2.3 million per job “created”. At that, the green economy’s share of GDP crept up only 0.3

percentage points.

The rest of the world is waking up to this folly. A decade after the Paris Agreement, over 81 percent of the world’s energy still comes from fossil fuels. Environmental statistician and author Bjorn Lomborg points out that achieving global net-zero by 2050 would require removing the equivalent of the combined emissions of China and the United States in each of the next five

years. “This puts us in the realm of science fiction,” he wrote recently.

In July, the U.S. Department of Energy released a major assessment assembled by a team of highly credible climate scientists which asserted that “CO 2 -induced warming appears to be less damaging economically than commonly believed,” and that aggressive mitigation policies might be “more detrimental than beneficial.” The report found no evidence of rising frequency or severity of hurricanes, floods, droughts or tornadoes in U.S. historical data, while noting that U.S. emissions reductions would have “undetectably small impacts” on global temperatures in any case.

U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright welcomed the findings, noting that improving living standards depends on reliable, affordable energy. The same day, the Environmental Protection Agency proposed rescinding the 2009 “endangerment finding” that had designated CO₂ and other GHGs as “pollutants.” It had led to sweeping restrictions on oil and gas development and fuelled policies that the current administration estimates cost the U.S. economy at least US$1 trillion in lost growth.

Even long-time climate alarmists are backtracking. Ted Nordhaus, a prominent American critic, recently acknowledged that the dire global warming scenarios used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change rely on implausible combinations of rapid population growth, strong economic expansion and stagnant technology. Economic growth typically reduces population increases and accelerates technological improvement, he pointed out, meaning emissions trends will likely be lower than predicted. Even Bill Gates has tempered his outlook, writing that climate change will not be “cataclysmic,” and that although it will hurt the poor, “it will not be the only or even the biggest threat to their lives and welfare.” Poverty and disease pose far greater threats and resources, he wrote, should be focused where they can do the most good now.

Yet Ottawa remains unmoved. Prime Minister Carney’s latest budget raises industrial carbon taxes to as much as $170 per tonne by 2030, increasing the competitive disadvantage of Canadian industries in a time of weak productivity and declining investment. These taxes will not measurably alter global emissions, but they will deepen Canada’s economic malaise and

push production – and emissions – toward jurisdictions with more lax standards. As others retreat from net-zero delusions, Canada moves further offside global energy policy trends – extending our country’s sad decline.

Unelected regulators and bureaucrats from the United Nations have pushed for crushing the global economy in the name of saving the planet.

In October, the International Maritime Organization (IMO), a specialized agency within the U.N., proposed a carbon tax in order to slash the emissions of shipping vessels. This comes after the IMO’s April 2025 decision to adopt net-zero standards for global shipping.

Had the IMO agreed to the regulation, it would have been the first global tax on greenhouse gas emissions. Thankfully, the United States was able to effectively shut down those proposals; however, while these regulations have been temporarily halted, the erroneous ideas behind them continue to grow in support.

Proponents of carbon taxes generally argue that since climate change is an existential threat to human existence, drastic measures must be taken in all aspects of our lives to address the projected costs. People should eat less meat and use public transportation more often. In the political arena, they should vote out so-called “climate deniers.” In the economic sphere, carbon taxes are offered as a technocratic quick fix to carbon emissions. Is any of this worth it? Or are the benefits greater than the costs? In the case of climate change, the answer is no.

Carbon taxes are not a matter of scientific fact. As with all models, the assumptions drive the analysis. In the case of carbon taxes, the time horizon selected plays a major role in the outcome. So, too, does the discount rate and the specific integrated assessment models.

In other words, “Two economists can give vastly different estimates of the social cost of carbon, even if they agree on the objective facts underlying the analysis.” If the assumptions are subjective, as they are in carbon taxes, then they are not scientific facts. As I’ve pointed out, “carbon pricing models are as much political constructs as they are economic tools.” One must also ask whether carbon taxes will remain unchanged or gradually increase over time to advance other political agendas. In this proposal, the answer is that it increases over time.

Additionally, since these models are driven by assumptions, one would be right in asking who gets to impose these taxes? Of course, those would be the unelected bureaucrats at the IMO. No American who would be subject to these taxes ever voted for the people attempting to create the “world’s first global carbon tax.” It brings to mind the phrase “no taxation without representation.”

In an ironic twist, imposing carbon taxes on global shipping might actually be one of the worst ways to slash emissions, given the enormous gains from trade. Simply put, trade makes the world grow rich. Not just wealthy nations like those in the West, but every nation, even the most poor, grows richer. In wealthy countries, trade can help address climate change by enabling adaptation and innovation. For poorer countries, material gains from trade can help prevent their populations from starving and also help them advance along the environmental Kuznets curve.

In other words, the advantages of trade can, over time, make a country go from being so poor that a high level of air pollution is necessary for its survival to being rich enough to afford reducing or eliminating pollution. Carbon taxes, if sufficiently high, can prevent or significantly delay these processes, thereby undermining their supposed purpose. Not to mention, as of today, maritime shipping accounts for only about 3% of total global emissions.

The same ingenuity that brought us modern shipping will continue to power the global economy and fund growth and innovation, if we let it. The world does not need a layer of global bureaucracy for the sake of virtue signaling. What it needs is an understanding of both economics and human progress.

History shows that prosperity, innovation, and free trade are what make societies cleaner, healthier, and richer. Our choice is not between saving the planet and saving the economy; it is between free societies and free markets or surrendering responsibility to unelected international regulators and busybodies. The former has lifted billions out of poverty, and the latter threatens to drag us all backwards.

A finance department review suggested women, youth, Indigenous, LGBTQ, Black and racialized entrepreneurs are underserved by Farm Credit Canada.

The Cabinet of Prime Minister Mark Carney said in a note that a Canadian Crown bank mostly used by farmers is too “white” and not diverse enough in its lending to “traditionally underrepresented groups” such as LGBT minorities.

Farm Credit Canada Regina, in Saskatchewan, is used by thousands of farmers, yet federal cabinet overseers claim its loan portfolio needs greater diversity.

The finance department note, which aims to make amendments to the Farm Credit Canada Act, claims that agriculture is “predominantly older white men.”

Proposed changes to the Act mean the government will mandate “regular legislative reviews to ensure alignment with the needs of the agriculture and agri-food sector.”

“Farm operators are predominantly older white men and farm families tend to have higher average incomes compared to all Canadians,” the note reads.

“Traditionally underrepresented groups such as women, youth, Indigenous, LGBTQ, and Black and racialized entrepreneurs may particularly benefit from regular legislative reviews to better enable Farm Credit Canada to align its activities with their specific needs.”

The text includes no legal amendment, and the finance department did not say why it was brought forward or who asked for the changes.

Canadian census data shows that there are only 590,710 farmers and their families, a number that keeps going down. The average farmer is a 55-year-old male and predominantly Christian, either Catholic or from the United Church.

Data shows that 6.9 percent of farmers are immigrants, with about 3.7 percent being “from racialized groups.”

Historically, most farmers in Canada are multi-generational descendants of Christian/Catholic Europeans who came to Canada in the mid to late 1800s, mainly from the United Kingdom, Ireland, Ukraine, Russia, Italy, Poland, the Netherlands, Germany, and France.",https://i1.wp.com/www.todayville.com/edmonton/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/01/tvrd-dowbiggin-carney-trudeau-image-2025-01-30.jpg?fit=600%2C337&ssl=1,N,,2025-11-19 12:56:42.915667

According to the report, progress in climate action in 2024 was not uniform across countries, sectors and policy instruments. While progress was recorded in emissions trading systems, transport-related policies (e.g. new phase outs of internal combustion engines), and carbon neutrality targets; other market-based instruments, such as carbon pricing, remain less used and cover less than half of global emissions.

Other positive developments included higher government spending on low-carbon research and development as well as regulations such as updated building codes and accelerated phase outs of coal plants. Sectoral challenges remain significant.

Fossil fuel use in electricity and heat and transport, continue to drive emissions, with only limited progress in shifting towards cleaner alternatives. Although electric vehicle uptake and internal combustion engine phase-outs are advancing, transport emissions remain high and overall policy action lags compared to other sectors despite recent progress.

Countries’ GHG emissions are not on track to reach net zero by 2050

Countries’ aggregate emissions are 8% (around 2.5 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent – Gt CO₂e) above the level needed to meet their 2030 targets. Furthermore, their current trajectories are inconsistent with NDCs and long-term net-zero goals, resulting in both an NDC Delivery Gap for 2030 and a large Target Consistency Gap for 2050. The forthcoming 2035 NDCs provide an opportunity to strengthen ambition and enhance credibility.

Only 18% of GHG emissions, covered by net-zero targets, are backed by legally binding commitments

As of September 2025, 114 countries and the European Union – together accounting for 92% of country-based emissions – have adopted net-zero targets. However, the scope and timing of existing net-zero commitments varies considerably. Not all pledges cover all greenhouse gases and sectors, nor are they uniformly set for 2050. For instance, China and India have set net-zero targets for 2060 and 2070 respectively, while Uruguay’s target is limited to CO₂.

As a result of both the absence of commitments in some countries and delayed targets in others, the aggregate global GHG emissions trajectory implied by net-zero commitments by 2050 remains above the 1.5-2°C range. Due to gaps in implementation and the absence of enforceable commitment even these pledges may not be met. Most countries have pledged net-zero targets through policy documents, such as Long-Term Low Emissions Development Strategies (LT-LEDS), NDCs or non-binding declarations.

Although the number of countries pledging net-zero emissions has increased in recent years, only 30 countries and the EU (27 Parties) – representing 17.7% of global GHG emissions – have enshrined their targets into law (Figure 1.6). Progress has stagnated with the share of global country-based emissions covered by legally binding net-zero targets increasing only by 0.5% since 2024 with only Moldova and Ukraine putting new legislation into force. Embedding net-zero targets in legally binding frameworks is important to ensure accountability and secure long-term implementation.

Continued momentum for net-zero pledges in international aviation and shipping

In 2023, member states of the International Maritime Organization also committed to reach net-zero emissions “by around 2050” for the international maritime sector. In April 2025, the IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee approved a draft Net‑Zero Framework – including a global emissions pricing mechanism and fuel standards – for adoption by October 2025 and enforcement from 2027.

While net-zero pledges in international aviation and shipping provide welcome signals of intent, they risk remaining aspirational without immediate action and innovation.

In Latin America (LATAM), that question takes a sharper form. Trade dependence, infrastructure constraints, and long, complex corridors create a landscape where sustainability begins as a cost challenge and becomes a systems challenge.

A practical way to understand that challenge is through a single metric: emissions intensity – grams of CO₂ per ton-kilometer in shipping or per available ton-kilometer in aviation. It is a measure of discipline – how effectively each unit of cargo moves across a network.

Efficiency first: Why emissions intensity matters

Global frameworks increasingly anchor their climate goals around efficiency metrics. The International Maritime Organization’s 2023 GHG Strategy calls for at least a 40 percent improvement in carbon intensity by 2030 compared with 2008 and sets indicative checkpoints for cutting total GHG emissions by 20 percent (striving for 30 percent) by 2030 and 70 percent (striving for 80 percent) by 2040, with a net zero target “by or around 2050.”

In parallel, the EU’s FuelEU Maritime regulation sets limits on the well-to-wake GHG intensity of energy used on board ships, starting with a 2 percent reduction in 2025 and tightening to an 80 percent reduction by 2050.

In aviation, IATA’s net zero 2050 work and SAF fact sheets consistently use emissions intensity and fuel efficiency indicators as core metrics in the decarbonization pathway.

For operators, emissions intensity is where efficiency, cost, and climate impact converge. Every improvement in route design, aircraft weight, vessel speed, load factor, or network utilization appears immediately in this measure. It turns sustainability into something quantifiable and actionable.

Shipping: Regulation, fuel, and the economics of cleaner miles

Shipping is undergoing a structural shift driven by regulation and economics. The EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) now applies to maritime transport. Under the phase-in rules, companies must surrender allowances for 40 percent of emissions reported for 2024, 70 percent of emissions reported for 2025, and 100 percent of emissions from 2026 onwards.

Alongside this, FuelEU Maritime mandates progressive reductions in the GHG intensity of the energy used on board, again putting efficiency and fuel choice at the center.

These policies apply to any ship calling at European ports, including services connecting LATAM with Europe and Asia, which are critical for agricultural exports, reefer cargo, and manufactured goods.

Fleet technology is already evolving. Analyses based on DNV’s Alternative Fuels Insight show strong growth in orders for ships capable of using alternative fuels, with LNG still leading the orderbook, methanol growing quickly, and early ammonia and hydrogen projects emerging.

For LATAM, these trends are not abstract. Export corridors often combine mountain passes, inland trucking, limited rail infrastructure, port congestion, and long ocean legs. Any friction in that chain increases fuel burn per ton-kilometer. Efficiency becomes both a climate lever and a competitiveness lever.

Register for All Access: Future of BPM 2026!

Aviation and LATAM cargo: Doing more with every ton-kilometer

In aviation, the transition is shaped by technological and physical constraints. Long-haul fleets will rely on liquid fuels for years, so the near-term focus is operational excellence (OPEX), fleet renewal, and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

The LATAM Airlines Group embeds its climate agenda in a strategy called “A Necessary Destination,” which includes a path to carbon neutrality by 2050 and a commitment to offset 50 percent of domestic emissions by 2030.

On its climate-change pages, LATAM highlights fuel-efficiency programs, route optimization initiatives, energy management efforts, and SAF development as the core levers of its environmental strategy.

The global context for SAF illustrates the scale of the challenge. IATA and related industry analyses report that SAF production in 2024 reached around 1 million tons, covering roughly 0.3 percent of global jet-fuel demand, even after doubling from 2023.

In this reality, most short-term emissions reductions depend on how well each flight is planned and flown, and how efficiently fleets are used and renewed. Emissions intensity is a direct proxy for the quality of these decisions.

LATAM’s position: Progress under constraint

LATAM faces a demanding operational reality: logistics chains cross uneven infrastructure, long distances, weather-exposed corridors, and macroeconomic volatility. Margins are often tight, meaning volatility is common.

At the same time, SAF typically costs several-times more than conventional jet fuel, and emerging marine fuels require new infrastructure and vessel investments, as underlined by IATA and multiple SAF and shipping-cost assessments. These pressures shape which decarbonization projects move first and at what pace.

Yet the region is advancing. Efficiency programs that stabilize fuel burn help defend margins. Better planning improves reliability along multi-modal corridors. Alignment with IMO, EU, and aviation climate frameworks preserves access to key markets that are progressively integrating climate requirements into trade and transport policy.

LATAM progresses under constraint, and that discipline is becoming a competitive asset.

Principles for leaders: Turning intensity into action

Four principles stand out for leaders navigating this transition:

1. Use emissions intensity as a management metric

Tracking CO₂ per ton-kilometer or per available ton-kilometer anchors sustainability in the same dashboards as cost, reliability, and service quality. It becomes part of operational performance, not a separate narrative.

2. Connect climate objectives with OPEX

Network design, speed, and load-factor policies, coordination at ports and airports, and reduction of dwell times deliver immediate efficiency and lower emissions. These are familiar levers for operations and business process management (BPM) teams.

3. Build collaboration around shared data

Shipping and air freight depend on coordination with terminals, ground handlers, forwarders, and customers. Shared data on schedules, loads, and bottlenecks allows the entire chain to reduce waste and avoid unnecessary movements.

4. Invest where efficiency and resilience overlap

Fleet renewal, digital planning platforms, and advanced analytics often reduce fuel burn, strengthen capacity planning, and improve service resilience at the same time. These investments sit at the intersection of performance and sustainability.

Moving with purpose

Sustainability in logistics becomes tangible when every kilometer and every ton moved follow a deliberate plan. Emissions intensity makes that intent measurable – an indicator of how consistently teams translate planning, alignment, and discipline into cleaner, more efficient operations.

The organizations that treat emissions intensity as a core performance indicator, more than just a side metric, will set the pace of this transition in LATAM and beyond.",,N,,2025-11-19 10:56:16.302994

South Korea’s minister of climate, energy and environment, Kim Sung-hwan, said it demonstrated the country’s commitment to “accelerating a just and clean energy transition”.
The north Asian country has the world’s seventh-largest coal power fleet and is the world’s fourth-largest thermal coal importer behind China, India and Japan, responsible for about 8% of global trade.
The analytics firm Kpler estimates Australia will sell about A$2.3bn (US$1.5bn) worth of thermal coal to South Korea this year.
Total thermal coal sales from Australian mines last financial year were $32bn.","The Australian government has been urged to prepare for a shift away from thermal coal exports and accelerate green industries after one of its main international customers signed up to close all coal-fired power plants by 2040.

South Korea, Australia’s third-biggest market for coal burned to generate electricity, announced at the Cop30 climate conference in Brazil that it was joining the “Powering Past Coal Alliance”, a group of about 60 nations and 120 sub-national governments, businesses and organisations committed to phasing out the fossil fuel.

South Korea’s minister of climate, energy and environment, Kim Sung-hwan, said it demonstrated the country’s commitment to “accelerating a just and clean energy transition”.

The north Asian country has the world’s seventh-largest coal power fleet and is the world’s fourth-largest thermal coal importer behind China, India and Japan, responsible for about 8% of global trade. Coal provides about 30% of its electricity.

“The shift from coal to clean power is not only essential for the climate. It will also help both the Republic of Korea and all other countries increase our energy security, boost the competitiveness of our businesses, and create thousands of jobs,” Kim said in a statement.

The pledge commits Korea to retiring 62 coal plants, 40 of which already have confirmed closure dates. The analytics firm Kpler estimates Australia will sell about A$2.3bn (US$1.5bn) worth of thermal coal to South Korea this year.

James Bowen, the director of consultancy ReMap Research, said South Korea’s decision would send a powerful signal across the Asia-Pacific.

“For Australia to continue to rely on fossil fuel exports in the medium to long term is a risky strategy,” he said.

He cited Australian Treasury modelling that suggested the country’s fossil fuel exports would fall in value by about 50% over the next five years regardless of where the country set its national emissions reduction target. Total thermal coal sales from Australian mines last financial year were $32bn.

“South Korea’s decision should prompt Australia to show leadership by discussing timeframes for its own fossil fuel phaseout while helping its regional neighbours to embrace clean energy,” Bowen said.

Tim Buckley, the director of Climate Energy Finance, said the Korean announcement was “brilliant” news and showed Australia’s trading partners were “responding to climate science and their treaty obligations”.

“Australia needs to pivot our export focus to low-emissions industries of the future, in particular exporting green iron and aluminium, critical minerals and lithium hydroxide to help our key trade partners jointly deliver on their decarbonisation objectives,” he said.

Australia is not a member of the Powering Past Coal Alliance, though the government has a target of increasing the proportion of electricity from renewable energy from about 42% over the past year to 82% by 2030.

The Australia political debate in recent days has been focused on the federal opposition dropping support for a bipartisan target of reaching net zero emissions by 2050 and indicating it would subsidise coal power if it won the next election, due in 2028.

South Korea has faced criticism for dropping a 100% renewable energy target and not acting faster to address the climate crisis. The Climate Action Tracker found it should phase out coal power by 2030 and gas power shortly after if its action were to be compatible with the goals of the Paris agreement.

It is also a significant importer of metallurgical coal, used in steelmaking. It has substantial nuclear and gas-power fleets, each supplying roughly 30% of its electricity.",,N,,2025-11-19 12:56:49.958387

""It has to be more sophisticated than that, and more collaborative than we have seen to date in that regard.""

Last month's MEPC meeting voted for a delay after significant opposition to the NZF emerged, in particular from the US. The US had threatened to impose tariffs and other punitive measures on countries voting for the deal if it passed, with President Donald Trump characterising the framework as 'this global green new scam tax on shipping'.

57 delegations voted to delay, 49 countries opposed the motion and 21 abstained. Two EU member states, Greece and Cyprus, went against the bloc's usual practice of voting together, with both abstaining on the delay measure.

""That needs to happen now, and the industry, I think, needs to be calling for it, and we need to work together.""

The net-zero framework, provisionally approved in April of this year, would have set progressively tougher carbon intensity requirements for marine fuels from the years 2028 to 2035, having first come into force in March 2027.

Nordic energy company Gasum, a FuelEU Maritime pooling service provider in Europe, on Tuesday (18 November) has started publishing a daily price for FuelEU Maritime compliance units on its website.

The quoted price is not an index but Gasum’s actual selling price per ton of carbon dioxide emitted.

With this move Gasum wants to enhance transparency in the evolving regulation compliance market.

“We at Gasum believe a more transparent and standardized FuelEU Maritime compliance market is needed to support shipping companies in making the right decisions,” said Jacob Granqvist, VP, Maritime, Gasum.

“For us pooling is about trust and pricing transparency is key in increasing the trust we know our customers have in us.”

The daily price of compliance units is now available on Gasum’s website and applies to volumes of 500 t CO2 and above.

Gasum generates regulation compliance by running several designated vessels on waste-based bio-LNG within its pool. Using bio-LNG as fuel generates generous amounts of compliance, as bio-LNG produces, on average, 90 percent lower emissions compared to traditional fuels such as MGO.

Depending on the feedstock used for producing the bio-LNG, the emissions can even be negative.

“Gasum’s FuelEU Maritime pooling service is uniquely reliable, since Gasum always provides the needed amount of bio-LNG into the pool,” the company added.

“Gasum takes full contractual responsibility of the pool’s balance, meaning that customers can transfer all regulation-related risk to Gasum.”

Ships that sail emission-free in and out of Port of Oslo will be exempt from quay fees, while using shore power and achieving a high environmental score will earn additional discounts, the port said on Monday (17 November).

Starting in 2026, environmentally friendly ships will receive up to a 100% discount. Ships that do not adopt green solutions will pay more.

A 100% discount on quay fees will be introduced for ships sailing emission-free in and out from Steilene while a 20% discount will be offered to cargo ships using established shore power facilities.

“Choosing zero-emission solutions should pay off. Oslo Port has invested heavily in green measures such as shore power and rewards those who take environmental responsibility,” said Port Director Ingvar M. Mathisen.

Port of Oslo was an early adopter of environmental discounts and contributions from all ships to invest in zero-emission technology. Now, further measures are being introduced to meet the city’s ambitious climate goals.

“We are changing previous discounts for scheduled traffic to reward ships that cut emissions. Cargo ships using shore power will receive a 20% discount. The goal is to promote environmentally friendly sea transport,” said Commercial Director Einar Marthinussen.

By 2030, the city aims to cut emissions by 95%, and Oslo Port by 85%, to become emission-free.

Oslo Port is working systematically to become a zero-emission port. Since 2018, NOK 225 million has been invested in zero-emission infrastructure, reducing emissions from port activities by 26%.

Shore power has been installed for cruise ships, international ferries, bulk carriers, and container ships. A new facility for cruise ships will open at Filipstad in 2026, and shore power for tankers is under planning.

Shore power and electric ferries have delivered good results, but more measures are needed to reach the targets. The next steps include alternative fuels, green transport corridors, and improved charging infrastructure.

READ the latest news shaping the hydrogen market at Hydrogen Central","Westwood Global Energy Group – Hydrogen Compass – November 2025

October brought both turbulent policy development and tangible progress for the European hydrogen market. In this edition of Hydrogen Compass, we explore how delayed international frameworks, recalibrated national strategies, and new legislative moves reveal a region still defining its hydrogen future. However, as governments debate the path forwards, developers are pressing ahead, moving projects from planning to execution and signalling that Europe’s hydrogen market is still taking shape.

The next edition will be published in December. In the meantime, if you have any comments or feedback, please do reach out to Jun Sasamura (jsasamura@westwoodenergy.com).

Project developments press ahead

Across Europe, developers pressed ahead with major projects. From refinery decarbonisation in Portugal and large-scale e-fuel initiatives in Spain, to new electrolysis plants in Germany and the UK, investment continued and key milestones were reached. This momentum reflects the relative resilience of the industry, even as regulatory and commercial challenges persist. Against this backdrop of positive progress, it is important to acknowledge that policy uncertainty is ongoing, shaping the pace and structure of future developments overall.

Policy turbulence across Europe

Policy delays and uncertainty have continued to define the pace of the European hydrogen market and October was no exception. While the EU advanced key regulatory frameworks, national governments took divergent paths. Meanwhile, international developments, particularly in maritime regulation, added further complexity.

IMO delays net-zero framework

The International Maritime Organisation (IMO) voted in October to delay its Net-Zero Framework (NZF) by one year. This delay could significantly impact future demand for hydrogen and green ammonia in the maritime sector. Originally designed to accelerate the uptake of renewable and low-carbon fuels, the NZF’s postponement introduces further uncertainty for developers and investors.

The delays followed intense opposition from the US, Saudi Arabia, Iran and Russia. The US president publicly condemned the NZF, calling it a ‘Global Green New Scam Tax on Shipping’ and reportedly threatened visa restrictions and higher trade costs for countries supporting the framework.

IMO Secretary General Aresenio Dominguez and International Chamber of Shipping (ICS) Secretary General Thomas Kazakos both expressed disappointments, calling the outcome a setback for zero-carbon shipping and investment in green fuels.

With the NZF now on hold, demand forecasts for hydrogen-derived marine fuels are likely to be revised downward, potentially slowing investment in hydrogen supply projects and green ammonia production capacity.

Diverging national strategies in Europe

While the EU continues to refine its hydrogen policy framework, national governments are taking varied approaches, with some accelerating and others reassessing.

EU: The European Parliament approved the EU’s Delegated Act on low-carbon hydrogen in October. The Act, originally adopted by the Commission in July, sets a 70% emissions reduction threshold for low-carbon hydrogen compared to fossil fuels.

It aims to provide clarity on CCS-enabled hydrogen and non-renewable-powered electrolysis and allows such project to access funding under the European Hydrogen Bank. Commissioner Dan Jørgensen confirmed that projects making investment decisions now won’t be subject to future revisions of the Act, which creates an important reassurance for developers.

By expanding eligibility and establishing clear emissions criteria, the Delegated Act is expected to strengthen investor confidence and maintain momentum in Europe’s hydrogen market, particularly as the sector seeks greater flexibility in production pathways.

Portugal: Portugal’s Secretary of State for Energy, João Barroca, criticised the previous government’s heavy focus on renewable hydrogen last month, calling it a misguided priority that diverted resources from more practical decarbonisation options like biomethane. He warned that an export-driven hydrogen strategy has failed to create domestic value or support Portuguese industry.

Reflecting this change in direction, the government revised its electrolyser capacity target down from the previous administration’s 5.5GW target to 3GW in the October 2024 climate plan. Despite this recalibration, Portugal has continued to progress key infrastructure projects, including a 10% hydrogen blending trial in the gas grid and the CelZa pipeline linking to Spain as part of the H2Med corridor.

This more pragmatic stance signals a strategic pivot, focused on aligning hydrogen policy with domestic industrial needs and long-term economic resilience.

Finland: In October, the Finnish government announced plans to finalise its dedicated hydrogen law by the end of 2025, with implementation scheduled for 2026. The legislation will clarify rules for production, transmission, ownership, pricing and safety, replacing the current reliance on natural gas regulations.

State-owned Gasgrid is already progressing with the national hydrogen network and the 2,500km Nordic-Baltic Hydrogen Corridor. Environmental assessments have also begun, with Worley appointed to lead front-end engineering through 2028.

Finland’s proactive approach aims to provide greater regulatory certainty, supporting its position as a key player in Northern Europe.

Germany: Germany’s hydrogen strategy came under scrutiny in October following a report from the federal audit office, which called for a revision to safeguard both climate and economic goals. The report criticised slow progress towards the country’s 10GW (6.6 GW(LHV)) 2030 target and flagged financial risks associated with the planned 9,000km hydrogen core network.

Despite these concerns, the German government advanced several key measures last month. The federal cabinet approved the draft Hydrogen Acceleration Act, which aims to streamline permitting for hydrogen production, imports, storage, and infrastructure. The law will designate hydrogen projects as being of ‘overriding public interest,’ giving them priority in planning and legal processes. Amendments to the Federal Mining Act will also permit natural hydrogen exploration in the country.

Germany also plans to review and potentially overhaul its renewable hydrogen support framework. The Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWK) acknowledged that the market has underperformed, prompting a review of funding schemes and a shift toward imports and cost-efficiency. Current programmes include €2.6 billion for H2Global import auctions, €4.6 billion for the Hy2Infra network, €30 million per project for overseas hydrogen investments, and a €6 billion Carbon Contracts for Difference (CCfD) to support industrial decarbonisation, which opened for applications for its second round in October.

Looking ahead, policy is expected to focus on reducing system costs by optimising electrolyser siting and utilising excess renewable power.

The IBIA has the right decision to have this spot right in this year's Hong Kong Maritime Week.","Speech by STL at International Bunker Industry Association Annual Convention 2025

Following is the speech by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, at the International Bunker Industry Association (IBIA) Annual Convention 2025 today (November 19):

Constantinos (Chair of the IBIA and Bunker Director at the Star Bulk Carriers, Mr Constantinos Capetanakis), Alexander (Executive Director of the IBIA, Mr Alexander Prokopakis), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, and many friends, old and new,

Welcome again to Hong Kong. Today is getting a little bit cold and I know that every one of you has made an effort to arrive here to make it for this forum. I can assure you that with the Chair's remarks, you would have a lot of takeaways from this forum this morning. It is actually a distinct honour for Hong Kong to host the IBIA's premier flagship event here for the very first time. Judging from what Constantinos just said, I think Hong Kong and the IBIA share a lot of the same vision. I truly agree with the particular phrase you mentioned that we need leadership and we need action and solutions, rather than just rules or discussions inside closed doors, we need to go to the ground. We also need to lead everybody for a joint solution towards the green transformation.

The IBIA's decision to host this event in Hong Kong is absolutely spot on. As you all know, we're renowned for our highly efficient, professional and smart port services, consistently ranking us among the world's top international maritime centres. This is complemented by our thriving bunkering activities, which put us seventh in the world, second in our country and first in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. We haven't said so in the past, but as we move on from conventional fuel to greener fuel for shipping vessels, we dig out our figures and records. It seems that it is not just that we have been doing good and ranking high in terms of cargo throughput, but we have also been making use of our pivotal position to provide fuel for ocean-going vessels over the decades. Therefore, it seems more than suitable to discuss the latest developments in bunkering in the busiest bunkering hub and the most happening port in the region. So I can assure you, Alexander, you have chosen the right place to host this forum since your visit last year.

Our strength in bunkering is no coincidence: Hong Kong is strategically located at the southernmost tip of southern China right next to international fairways, making it a perfect place for ships to refuel. And now, as the entire marine community is pivoting to decarbonisation, a great opportunity lies right ahead of us. By leveraging this strategic position, Hong Kong is poised to develop into a leading centre for green maritime fuel bunkering as well as trading - ensuring we continue to meet the industry's evolving needs for top-notch, sustainable bunkering services. In fact, to support the International Maritime Organization (IMO)'s vision of achieving net-zero carbon emissions from international shipping by or around 2050, the HKSAR (Hong Kong Special Administrative Region) Government took action quickly, and we are determined to do so, notwithstanding the hiccups recently on the schedule of the IMO. Exactly one year ago, we laid out a clear pathway and roadmap for our port in the Action Plan on Green Maritime Fuel Bunkering promulgated.

The thinking behind our Action Plan is very simple: we need to offer the industry a clear direction on green maritime fuel adoption, supported by policies that can turn our shared vision for a green maritime fuel bunkering and trading centre into reality. That's why we've set out in the Action Plan five main strategies - Green Fuel, Green Port, Green Incentives, Green Collaboration and Green Talents. We have 10 specific measures underpinning these five strategies.

Starting with Green Fuels, we make clear that Hong Kong will adopt a multi-fuel strategy, with the most commonly used or explored fuels such as LNG (liqified natural gas), biodiesel, methanol, ammonia and hydrogen being the fuels of choice. We then set out to build up a supply chain of such fuels in Hong Kong, from locating sources of green fuels in the proximity, that is the Chinese Mainland, which is conveniently right next to us and have been the largest supplier of such fuels by far, to developing storage facilities and providing bunkering infrastructure in Hong Kong. We are small, but I think we will be targeted and focused in providing, putting and rolling out storage facilities, infrastructure support, so as to allow Hong Kong to provide a miniature of the ecosystem that is advocated under the IBIA. Crucially, this strategy is already backed by concrete regulatory actions. Just to name a few, we have passed the enabling legislation, published technical requirements and guidelines, and approved a duty exemption for methanol bunkering. In the old days, there used to be some industry using the methanol for making wine. And that is not good for health. That is why we have updated legislation on charging duty on methanol. It might have just looked like a simple piece of legislation; we went around the government administration, particularly the health authorities, the doctors and the medical practitioners. While we respect their professionalism, it took us some time to convince them that we are now looking for bunkering only, for our outward-looking ships and not winemaking. While we have already amended our law, we promised that we will input, inject some of the tightened safeguarding measures, from the customs point of view, to make sure that there will be no abuse of this tax exemption. But this is a right signal that we have expedited, and we hope to see the first-ever methanol bunkering operation soon in Hong Kong.

These are the precise policy measures, and legislative and supporting measures that we promised. We are designed to make green maritime fuel bunkering a practical and competitive reality. One year on, we have indeed come a long way, with commercial LNG and biodiesel bunkering services now available in Hong Kong and nearly 200 000 tonnes of green maritime fuels bunkered to date in Hong Kong. Still a lot of our industry players are not aware that Hong Kong has been treated to that point. They think that we are still at the initiation stage, still at the drafting stage. But I need to publicise more and talk more that we are actually actionable. We put things into operation, and it's not just for pilots, but it was for commercial operation. The first methanol bunkering operation, as I just mentioned, will also happen before long, while we will start looking into ammonia and hydrogen bunkering and hope to tell the market where we stand on it soon.

We fully recognise that the maritime industry is global by nature. I also mentioned and discussed at the ICS (International Chamber of Shipping) summit, we do not treat Hong Kong-based shipping companies as local companies. We treat them all along as global companies. We are globally based. We need to take their concerns and anxieties, arising from all the geopolitical circumstances, dear to our hearts. We have to listen, facilitate and help them to resolve and to take solutions. A truly green transition can't happen in isolation; it demands collaboration between ports available worldwide. First, we have been supporting our port operators in their effort to reduce carbon emissions and create a greener port. But just as importantly, we are looking outward, we are actively identifying ports with which to establish green shipping corridors. I would like to learn more from the IBIA, because from your base worldwide, I already know that there are a few existing green shipping corridors in operation, and there are a few being planned. I very much hope that Hong Kong will be able to participate in some of those, if not all. If Hong Kong can lead discussions on creating a new ones, perhaps in this part of the region, we can actively participate and contribute. For the very first step, we have also announced the signing of the first batch of partner ports. This paved our way to put Hong Kong in a more high-profile position, so that we can attract more sisters and brothers to build a greater alliance. This initiative will definitely drive us to upgrade our infrastructure and enhance green maritime fuel bunkering capabilities, with the ultimate goal of creating truly net-zero emission shipping lanes. We will have some exciting updates on this front next year, particularly on our move towards creating or joining the green shipping corridors. It is not just an upward or a high profile publicising move, but actually I would like to use this to drive inward, back home. The effort towards building a green port is very important to push our ship operators or container terminal operators to invest and expedite their action. The IBIA Secretariat will know that there needs to be a lot of participation and influence, especially on the operators because they have to really invest billions and trillions of money. They will need to know the long-term future and long-term bright spot on that. But in the meantime, they will definitely need to make some tough decisions right in the short term for investments. With Hong Kong putting our footprint on the worldwide green transformation path, I would like to use this as a triggering point to enable our operators and industry players to join, participate and act.

Closer to home, we are forging partnerships with stakeholders from both Hong Kong and the Chinese Mainland. I think one of the points that the IBIA comes to Hong Kong is that you would like to run Hong Kong as a platform and you can get more knowledge about what is happening in the Chinese Mainland. In particular, we have set up some platforms and communication channels to focus squarely on fuel supply and trading with the Chinese Mainland. A powerful example of this collaboration was this June, when we signed Memoranda of Understanding (MOU) with four green maritime fuel suppliers and bunker operators. This took place at a groundbreaking event - the first ever Mainland-Hong Kong green energy business matchmaking event organised under the auspices of the Ministry of Commerce of the Central People's Government. It is actually motivated and rooted between the Ministry of Commerce and my bureau. We hosted that matchmaking event in a dual mode. It was hosted both in Hong Kong and Shenzhen. We witnessed the signing of the MOU online and in parallel mode, thanks to all the digital technological backup. With over 300 industry representatives participating, the event was a clear sign of our shared commitment to building a thriving ecosystem for maritime fuel bunkering and trading. But we didn't stop there, we established a communication platform that encompasses companies registered and doing business in Hong Kong from across the entire maritime fuel bunkering supply chain, with a view to facilitating business discussion and collecting views from the trade on ways to bolster our competitiveness in green maritime fuel bunkering and trading. We warmly welcome all interested Hong Kong companies to join the communication platform. For all those from abroad, we welcome you to have branches or headquarters in Hong Kong, and we also welcome them to join this communication platform which we will be announcing soon, so stay tuned. Together, we can firmly put Hong Kong on the map as a premier green maritime fuel bunkering hub in the region, as well as a green maritime fuel trading centre that acts as the gateway for export and trading of Mainland-produced green maritime fuels.

Ladies and gentlemen, the transition towards green maritime fuels is an irreversible trend for the maritime industry and this is what we have mentioned. This isn't a choice or an option; it's an imperative. And Hong Kong is all in. To navigate this change, we need forums like this. The IBIA has the right decision to have this spot right in this year's Hong Kong Maritime Week. I am sure you have helped drive some of our 18 000-plus participants this year, which is a record high. Today is about preparing for that future. The conversations in this room will equip us with the crucial steps we need very much to take, together and ahead. My thank to the IBIA for bringing us all together today, I encourage all participants this morning to make best of this event, learn more about the opportunities here in Hong Kong and also worldwide in different countries, different ports. We are all very passionate, notwithstanding the International Maritime Organization's agenda, and we hope that we can explore how we, together, can be a part of that exciting green journey.

I wish you all a very fruitful event and a pleasant stay in Hong Kong. Thank you very much.",https://image.bastillepost.com/640x/wp-content/uploads/global/2025/11/P2025111900339_photo_1317579_FB.jpg,N,,2025-11-19 01:56:37.035682

The IMO Net-Zero Framework has been described as a “momentous achievement,” and in many ways it is.","The International Maritime Organization convened this October 2025 to vote on a framework that could reshape global shipping and redefine climate justice.

The IMO Net-Zero Framework, agreed upon this past April at MEPC 83 – The Marine Environmental Protection Committee, represents the first legally binding global regulation to decarbonize international shipping, a sector responsible for emissions equivalent to major economies like Japan or Germany.

Yet as this historic moment approaches, a critical question hangs in the balance: Will this framework deliver both the ambitious emissions reductions and the equitable transition that our planet and its most vulnerable communities desperately need? The answer depends entirely on decisions to be made in the coming weeks and months.

THE FRAMEWORK

The IMO Net-Zero Framework introduces an innovative two-tier system that sets increasingly stringent greenhouse gas intensity limits for ships while creating economic incentives through a carbon pricing mechanism.

Ships that fail to meet targets will pay penalties: $100 per tonne for moderate non-compliance and a steep $380 per tonne for those falling furthest behind. These fees will generate an estimated $10 billion to $12 billion annually, flowing into a novel IMO Net-Zero Fund designed to support the transition.

On paper, this is groundbreaking. The framework will drive shipping toward zero-emission fuels, with modeling from University College London and UMass indicating that e-fuels (particularly green ammonia) will become the dominant solution by the mid-2040s.

Yet here lies the framework’s central tension: while it will eventually drive the right technological outcomes, it may arrive too late for a smooth transition and risk leaving the world’s most vulnerable countries to bear disproportionate costs along the way.

The IMO’s own 2023 greenhouse gas strategy established two equally important objectives: reaching net-zero emissions by or around 2050 and achieving this through a “just and equitable transition.”

UN Trade and Development analysis reveals ship transport costs may increase by 80 per cent, with the broader maritime logistics costs (which would affect imports) potentially rising by 30 per cent.

For Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and Least Developed Countries (LDCs), already bearing the brunt of climate impacts they did little to cause, these increases threaten food security, economic development, and basic quality of life.

The framework’s projected revenue of $10 billion to $12 billion annually, while significant compared to other climate finance mechanisms, pales against the estimated trillion dollars of additional investment needed by 2050. Every dollar must work extraordinarily hard to serve both decarbonization and equity.

WHY THIS MATTERS

The IMO framework is more than a shipping policy; it’s a test case for global climate governance in sectors operating beyond national boundaries. International shipping accounts for roughly 90 per cent of global trade; how we decarbonize it will shape economic development pathways for decades.

Moreover, shipping’s transition challenge mirrors that of other transport sectors but with unique complications. A ship’s route is more than often unpredictable, following wherever cargo demands and, therefore, requiring fuel infrastructure in numerous global locations.

This creates a chicken-and-egg problem: ship owners won’t invest in new fuel technologies without infrastructure, and infrastructure won’t materialize without demand. The solution requires parallel progress on supply and demand.

Countries with potential for renewable energy production (including many in Africa) could become major green fuel producers, but they face higher costs of capital and infrastructure deficits. Strategic deployment of Net-Zero Fund resources could help build this infrastructure while creating economic opportunities in regions that have historically been excluded from energy transition benefits.

WHAT ADOPTION MUST DELIVER

When IMO member states gather in October, they must adopt a framework that explicitly commits to resolving these tensions. The adoption process should: Affirm the dual mandate.

Clearly restate that just and equitable transition is co-equal with emissions reduction, not subordinate to it. Establish guardrails for guidelines. Provide clear direction that reward mechanisms must preserve adequate resources for vulnerable cause, these increases threaten food security, economic development, and basic quality of life.

Clearly restate that just and equitable transition is co-equal with emissions reduction, not subordinate to it. Establish guardrails for guidelines.

Provide clear direction that reward mechanisms must preserve adequate resources for vulnerable country support, that distribution boundaries must be interpreted to address shipping’s full climate impact, and that credit trading must include safeguards against perpetuating inequity.

Commit to transparent, inclusive guideline development. The negotiations beginning immediately after adoption must meaningfully include voices from SIDS, LDCs, and civil society organizations representing vulnerable communities, not just industry and major maritime nations.

Set review mechanisms that maintain ambition. Ensure that the 2032 revision of targets for 2036-2040 incorporates both updated climate science and assessments of just transition progress.

A CLOSING REFLECTION

The transition away from fossil fuels in shipping is inevitable. The only question is whether it will be orderly or chaotic, equitable or exploitative, a model for climate cooperation or another instance of the powerful protecting their interests while externalizing costs onto the vulnerable.

The close of the extraordinary session of the MEPC proved that the IMO has sadly become vulnerable to political capture. The Net-Zero Framework, which had been approved by 64 countries in April with only 16 opposed, was deferred for one year despite having clear majority support.

The process was reportedly bent to the will of certain influential actors through threats and intimidation, rather than genuine consensus- building. The IMO Net-Zero Framework has been described as a “momentous achievement,” and in many ways it is.

But achievements are measured by outcomes, not intentions. Without clear regulatory signals, the industry will continue to procrastinate on investments in zero-emission technologies.

The deferral creates regulatory uncertainty that could delay the transition by years, making it even harder to meet 2030 and 2040 targets.

Highlighting Hong Kong’s fintech strengths, Banga pointed to potential applications for stablecoins.","Speaking at the World Maritime Merchants Forum during Hong Kong Maritime Week 2025, Mr. Angad Banga, Chief Operating Officer of The Caravel Group, the parent company of Fleet Management Limited, and Chairman of the Hong Kong Shipowners’ Association and Chairman of the Promotion and External Relations Committee of the Hong Kong Maritime and Port Development Board, called for urgent and coordinated investment to accelerate the maritime industry’s transition to net-zero emissions.

“If we wait for perfect clarity, we will lose ground,” Banga urged in his keynote address, “Unlocking Global Maritime Capital: Hong Kong’s Role in Leading the Green Transition”. He urged shipowners, regulators, and financiers to act decisively in the wake of the IMO’s recent postponement of its Net-Zero Framework. “This creates a leadership opportunity — and Hong Kong is ready to lead”.

Banga positioned Hong Kong as a gateway between China and the global market, combining its role as an international maritime hub and financial powerhouse to fund decarbonisation as well as explore innovative financial tools — from sustainability-linked loans to Stablecoins and the digital yuan — to drive the transition.

Infrastructure and Green Fuel Readiness

Hong Kong shipowners control nearly 10% of the global merchant fleet by deadweight tonnage, with four of the world’s top 10 ship management companies headquartered in the city. Banga reaffirmed Hong Kong’s push to expand capacity for alternative fuels — ammonia, methanol, hydrogen, biofuels, and LNG — supported by the Hong Kong Government’s Action Plan on Green Maritime Fuel Bunkering.

By the end of Hong Kong Maritime Week, the city will have completed three LNG bunkering operations alongside cargo handling.

“Our location in the Greater Bay Area, near Mainland China’s renewable fuel production hubs, gives us a unique advantage as one of the most practical and efficient green fuel supply centres,” he told delegates.

Financing the Transition

Hong Kong currently ranks third globally in the Global Financial Centres Index, just narrowly behind London and New York, and facilitates over 70% of global offshore RMB payments. In 2025 alone, 80 companies went public with a pipeline of 300, while companies raised nearly US$60 billion through IPOs, placements, convertibles, and exchangeable bond offerings.

Banga stressed that infrastructure must be matched by incentives and policy certainty to support early adopters and avoid stranded assets.

“Shipping is the backbone of global trade, and decarbonisation is creating new markets for fuels, technologies, and services — all of which require capital,” he said. Hong Kong’s deep capital markets, record IPO activity, and strong green finance ecosystem make it uniquely placed to fund this transition.

Policy Alignment and Global Leadership

Addressing the recent postponement of the IMO’s Net-Zero Framework, Banga warned that fragmented regulations such as CII, EEXI, EU ETS, and FuelEU create a “patchwork” of overlapping requirements that slow investment and risk stranded assets.

“Without clear incentives and predictable frameworks, the risk of stranded assets is real,” he said, urging shipowners, regulators, and financiers to “work together to harmonise frameworks, build supply chains, and share costs.”

Innovation and Digital Assets

The Hong Kong Government has issued HK$240 billion in green bonds since 2018, while the Core Climate carbon marketplace, launched in 2022, connects capital with climate action.

To further support the industry, the Malaysian Palm Oil Council (MPOC) published a study in November 2024 to drive the Malaysian palm oil industry towards carbon neutrality and net zero emissions.
The MSPO certification is mandatory for the palm oil industry and its plantations in Malaysia, and it is a national initiative to make palm oil production more responsible, ethical and competitive.
The MSPO standards are also facilitating the Malaysian palm oil industry to achieve their net zero commitments and mitigate climate change.
Clearly, there is a lot of developments and innovations in the palm oil industry to head towards zero waste and net zero emissions.","The Malaysian palm oil industry has long practised zero waste principles by turning agricultural waste into useful resources, which also prevents carbon emissions from decomposition of waste.

Whether it is solid waste — comprising empty fruit bunches (EFB), fibre and shells — or liquid waste, which is the palm oil mill effluent (POME) generated from the processing of fresh fruit bunches to crude palm oil, all parts of the oil palm are turned into fertiliser, fuel and other products.

This is a crucial step towards achieving a true circular economy, where nothing is wasted, and it aligns with three of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDG): SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production) and SDG 13 (climate action).

These efforts by the palm oil industry also support Malaysia’s goal to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, which is outlined by policy documents like the National Energy Transition Roadmap and New Industrial Master Plan 2030.

The major palm oil industry players in the country have set their own net zero targets, alongside various sustainability goals that are aligned with the national targets and global demands.

To further support the industry, the Malaysian Palm Oil Council (MPOC) published a study in November 2024 to drive the Malaysian palm oil industry towards carbon neutrality and net zero emissions.

The study, done in collaboration with Swinburne University of Technology (Sarawak campus), outlines a roadmap for the industry to reach net zero and strengthen its role as a global leader in climate-smart agriculture.

It also showcases the industry’s ability to achieve net zero emissions above the global average through compliance with the Malaysian Sustainable Palm Oil (MSPO) certification.

The MPOC’s study reviews current systems in place and introduces emerging technologies. It also provides an overview of challenges faced by the industry in implementing these solutions, and provides recommendations for consideration.

Some of the current practices that have achieved significant outcomes are the use of combined heat and power systems and biogas capture from POME. The MSPO certification requirements coupled with industry best practices have resulted in 68.8% of the industry’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction by replacing fossil fuels and avoiding methane emissions.

POME is a highly acidic but nutrient-rich wastewater, which emits methane gas that can be harnessed to generate energy. The energy is used to either power operations in remote mills or sold to the grid.

Other organic waste from plantations like fronds, palm tree trunks and EFB are used as mulch and fertiliser for healthier soil. Waste from palm oil mills like palm mesocarp fibre, palm kernel cake and palm kernel shells are burned in controlled facilities to generate energy, thus reducing the use of fossil fuels.

Many of the emerging technologies introduced in the study involve more effective use of EFB. The current industry practice is to return EFB to plantations as mulching materials, or to convert them into biofertiliser or animal feed. Some advanced power plants might be able to use EFB as feedstock.

An emerging solution identified in the report is to convert EFB into briquettes or pellets, which can be used to generate renewable energy. Another is to convert EFB into biochar via pyrolysis, which is where organic matter is heated in a stable environment without oxygen. The resulting product is a black solid called biochar that can be used for soil aeration as well as water retention in soil, improving its quality and also enhancing carbon storage in soil, contributing to long-term sequestration.

Moreover, EFB can be used in gasification technologies to produce synthetic gas, which in turn is used for green power generation. Gasification is a process where feedstock, EFB in this case, is exposed to high temperatures without actual fire, with minimal oxygen and steam. EFB can also be fermented to obtain bioethanol, which has many uses across industries.

For more of these emerging technologies to be implemented at a large scale, more research and development (R&D) is required. Collaborative efforts between industry players, researchers and government agencies are also needed.

Additionally, to reduce the cost of the technological solutions, the local manufacturing of equipment has to be expanded. For instance, biomass power generation requires high-pressure steam generators, of which local manufacturers are unable to produce. Besides, some anaerobic digestion components used in the biogas production pipeline are also imported from Germany, according to MPOC’s study.

On the other hand, more efficient collection, transport and storage of biomass materials is needed, and the yield and quality of the materials used must remain consistent.

With a consistent and high-quality feedstock, coupled with good infrastructure — such as reliable electricity grid access and transport networks — the palm oil industry can lead in producing green energy for the nation from agricultural waste.

Of course, for that to happen, substantial capital injection would have to be available, so more can be done for companies to access financing, grants and incentives to alleviate the financial burden of adopting emerging technologies.

The MSPO certification is mandatory for the palm oil industry and its plantations in Malaysia, and it is a national initiative to make palm oil production more responsible, ethical and competitive.

The certification standards are routinely reviewed to ensure they are up to date and can help Malaysian planters meet global demands, while assisting smaller planters who might require more resources to transition to sustainable practices.

For example, an independent plantation smallholder with less than 46ha would not be audited under the same guidelines as a plantation with more than 500ha.

The MSPO standards were last updated in 2022, and implemented earlier this year. The revised standards were strengthened with more stringent sustainability requirements, including a “No Deforestation” cut-off date of Dec 31, 2019, and high conservation value (HCV) assessments. They also focus on social responsibility, transparency and ethical conduct, as well as improved traceability systems.

The MSPO standards are also facilitating the Malaysian palm oil industry to achieve their net zero commitments and mitigate climate change. On the environmental front, companies are now required to identify sources of GHG emissions, and monitor and plan for emissions reductions.

To assist companies along this journey, MSPO developed a GHG calculator, which will be released later this year for public use.

Recognising the global pressure on oil palm companies to adopt sustainability, many Malaysian companies have already been investing in these efforts and pushing the boundaries of innovation in sustainability.

Generating energy using POME in mills is quite commonly done by the plantation companies, as is the use of solid waste from oil palm as fertiliser. But the companies are not stopping there, and continue to invest in R&D to innovate new solutions.

SD Guthrie Bhd, for instance, recently launched a project in Carey Island, its innovation hub, where all machinery and previously diesel-powered vehicles have transitioned to B30 biodiesel, which is a blend of 30% palm oil and 70% diesel. According to the company, it achieved up to 23% reduction in GHG emissions from this initiative.

Meanwhile, IOI Group replaced diesel-powered agricultural machines used on its plantations with electric-powered ones. In remote estates, it is using solar farms to generate renewable energy.

The company has also established IOI Palm Wood Sdn Bhd to convert unused oil palm trunks into high-performance palm wood panels for furniture and the building industry, and partnered with Nextgreen Global Bhd to develop a zero-waste paper pulp plant from EFB.

Kuala Lumpur Kepong Bhd started installing the filter belt-press (FBP) system, which reduces methane formation and turns POME into fertiliser. Water, which is a by-product from the process, is recycled for cleaning purposes. According to the company, 35 FBPs have been installed.

United Plantations Bhd, which received the world’s first Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil certificate in 2008, has been tracing its emissions using life cycle assessments (LCA), completing the first LCA on palm oil in 2008.

The latest LCA report from February 2025 found that the company has shown a 60% reduction in GHG emissions per kg of palm oil produced from 2004 to 2024, when including indirect land use change and nature conservation, as well as Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions.

On the other hand, FGV Holdings Bhd invested in a waste-to-wealth initiative that generates energy from POME, and exports palm kernel shells to Japan as biofuel. More recently, FGV invested in spent silica valorisation and glycerine pitch valorisation processes.

Spent silica, which is a by-product from the biodiesel pre-treatment plant, is repurposed to absorb 90% of phosphorus and 60% of free fatty acids in crude palm oil. Meanwhile, glycerine with impurities, which comes from the glycerine refinery plant, is repurposed as a catalyst for solid biofuel production.

Clearly, there is a lot of developments and innovations in the palm oil industry to head towards zero waste and net zero emissions. As the industry players continue to invest in R&D to implement more innovative solutions, the path forward for sustainable Malaysian palm oil is clear and achievable.

The association has formed a strategic alliance with other European cruise associations – Cruise Baltic, Cruise Britain, Cruise Norway, and Cruise Europe – to coordinate best practices and harmonise environmental and tourism sustainability initiatives across Europe’s cruise destinations.","Stakeholders from the world of transport, accommodation, restaurants, and activities have signed a declaration committing to decarbonising by 2050. For cruise ships, which combine all of those areas into one, the challenges are very particular.

Holidays can be an enchanting escape from reality, and cruise tourism can be a particularly exciting adventure ­– a floating city that carries you to exotic locations. But it can also have big impacts on local environments if not managed correctly.

Cruise ships combine the impacts of hotels, transport, and entertainment into a single package, and the sector has grown fast since the pandemic pause. The cruise industry has been looking at ways to monitor and improve its sustainability performance.

The global cruise industry, including both ship operations and related activity, is estimated to account for around 0.6%-0.7% of total tourism-related CO₂ emissions according to MedCruise, an industry association representing over 160 ports and cruise destinations across the Mediterranean and its adjoining seas.

“Although this share is relatively small within the broader tourism system, the per-passenger footprint can be higher due to the energy demands of operating large vessels and providing hotel-level amenities at sea,” explains MedCruise president Theodora Riga. “It is also important to note that there is wide variation across the sector, as emissions depend heavily on factors such as ship size, itinerary, fuel type, distance travelled, and occupancy levels.”

Direct comparisons difficult

Direct comparisons with a flight show that purely as a mode of transport, cruise ships are more emissions-intensive. One recent overview by GreenMatch estimates that even relatively efficient large cruise ships emit around 250 g of CO₂ per passenger-kilometre, whereas typical air travel ranges from about 10-130 g CO₂ per passenger-kilometre, depending on aircraft and route. But of course, cruise ships aren’t a means of transport like an airplane.

Combining all the impacts of a holiday – the transport, accommodation, and activities – into one means direct emissions-intensity comparisons to the total emissions of a land-based holiday are difficult to calculate.

“Beyond CO₂, cruise operations involve other environmental aspects including air pollutants like SOx, NOx, and particulates, waste management, and water usage,” notes Riga. “Overall, while cruising remains a relatively small but visible segment of global tourism emissions, its growth trajectory means decarbonization is both a priority and a responsibility shared across the industry.”

Stakeholder declaration

Last year, the various elements of the European tourism sector signed up to a declaration committing to decarbonisation actions. The declaration, signed in Rhodes, Greece, by industry groups including the Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA), the hospitality association HotRec, Airports Council International, and attractions industry association IAAPA, reaffirms the sector goal of working toward decarbonisation by 2050, in line with the EU’s target.

“The travel and tourism industry is neither immune to, nor unaware of, the challenges posed by climate change,” they wrote. “Severe environmental impacts such as rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and habitat destruction threaten the very resources tourism relies on.”

Of course, what isn’t measured can’t be reduced. Certification schemes will be needed to show that progress is being made. The Global Sustainable Tourism Council is managing the global GSTC Standards for sustainable travel and tourism, as well as providing international accreditation for sustainable tourism certification bodies.

“An assessment consists of making objective ratings of compliance to all the elements of a standard,” explains GSTC CEO Randy Durband. “They are benchmarking tools and not marks. “A proper certification mark is one in which the assessment is made by an expert auditor with full impartiality by a 3rd-party agent.” For each element of the assessment, a tourism provider is deemed to be compliant or non-compliant.

Improvements to sustainability performance for cruise ships can be made through actions such as “improving ship design to include recycling facilities and first-level sewage treatment,” he notes.

“Those we work with are driving their land suppliers to use more clean energy vehicles and other improvements per our standard for tour operators. CLIA is providing some financial support to ports to conduct GSTC Destination Assessments in order to drive improvement.

It isn’t just voluntary industry commitments driving the change.

Durband says one of the biggest policy drivers that is driving improvement in Europe is the mandate that by 2030, all cruise ports must provide the capacity for ships to plug into the local electricity grid in order to shut down their engines while in port. This practice is known as “cold ironing”.

That is unique to the EU, and “there are no truly significant regulations for big ships outside the EU that we’re aware of,” he says. He also points to local policies, such as the Port of Amsterdam requirement that riverboats be certified green in order to discharge passengers in the city centre.

Improvements so far

Several large cruise lines have invested in LNG-powered ships. LNG can significantly reduce SOₓ, NOₓ, and particulate emissions compared with heavy fuel oil and can lower CO₂ emissions on a tank-to-wake basis.

However, LNG can suffer from methane slip, where unburnt methane escapes, and methane is a very potent greenhouse gas, which could undermine climate benefits. So proper installation and handling are essential. Companies and shipyards are also exploring bio-LNG, green methanol, and synthetic fuels, though these are still at pilot scale.

There are also design elements available to reduce emissions. These include optimised hull forms and low-friction coatings, high-efficiency propulsion and hotel systems, LED lighting, and smart HVAC. Route optimisation software can minimise fuel use. And in some cases, hybrid systems with batteries can handle peak loads or enable short zero-emission operation in sensitive areas.

Riga from MedCruise says that at the global level, the IMO’s Greenhouse Gas Strategy, revised in 2023, has helped guide the global industry toward a goal of net-zero GHG emissions by around 2050.

“The MARPOL Annex VI regulations on air pollution have also been transformative, particularly through the creation of Sulphur Emission Control Areas (SECAs), now extended to the Mediterranean, where sulphur content in fuels is limited to 0.1%,” she says. She notes that within Europe, the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) has become “the single most impactful instrument”.

“Since January 2024, cruise ships calling at EU ports must purchase carbon allowances for their CO₂ emissions, 40% in 2024, rising to 100% by 2026. This represents a direct economic incentive for cruise lines to cut emissions through cleaner fuels, operational efficiency, and optimised itineraries,” she says.

Further action

In 2024, MedCruise conducted a study entitled “Sustainability Investments and Projects in the Mediterranean Ports”, analysing the implementation of environmental monitoring programs, OPS deployment, alternative fuels, pollution prevention and biodiversity protection. It finds a number of possible areas for future action, such as fuel-switching, net zero propulsion research and smarter itineraries.

The association has formed a strategic alliance with other European cruise associations – Cruise Baltic, Cruise Britain, Cruise Norway, and Cruise Europe – to coordinate best practices and harmonise environmental and tourism sustainability initiatives across Europe’s cruise destinations. They are also a partner in the EU-funded BlueMissionMed initiative, part of the EU Mission “Restore our Ocean and Waters by 2030,” which supports research, stakeholder engagement, and investment toward cleaner Mediterranean waters.

One of the most important factors is cooperation with the ports that cruise ships dock in, Riga says.

“Cruise sustainability ultimately depends on strong port and city collaboration, since the environmental and social effects of cruising are most visible at the local level,” she says.

MedCruise works with member ports, who in turn work closely with their municipalities and destination authorities to develop joint frameworks for emissions reduction, waste and water management, and visitor flow control.

“Many of our member ports co-invest with their cities in shore power systems, while others adopt fuel-switching policies or anchor restrictions to protect sensitive marine ecosystems such as Posidonia meadows,” notes Riga.

Sustainable tourism management is another key focus. “Together with local authorities, cruise ports and destinations have implemented measures to better manage passenger flows, including berth allocation, which manages the number of calls per day and adjusts scheduling to avoid peak times.”

Cruise lines have also been promoting alternative excursions that distribute visitors more evenly, and are looking into the development of low-impact experiences, such as walking or cycling tours and connections to nearby communities. “These destination-level collaborations demonstrate that sustainability is not only about technology but also about responsible management and respect for local communities,” she says.

The industry has made genuine steps, such as installing LNG, shore power, efficiency retrofits, and advanced wastewater treatment. But these steps risk being outpaced by growth in ship size and traffic. As the sector develops, it will be essential to continue efforts at developing cleaner fuels, better passenger management, and shore-side solutions.

Tech neutrality Moises Blanco Rios, a policy officer for clean transport transitions at the European Commission’s research and innovation directorate (DG RTD), echoed Tomassini.
He highlighted that shipping decarbonisation translates into real impacts and opportunities for EU citizens and coastal communities.","The International Maritime Organization has pushed back the adoption of its first binding Net Zero framework for shipping, deferring a decision that would shape the industry’s decarbonisation trajectory for decades. The delay underscores the regulatory uncertainty facing global carriers as they weigh investment in alternative fuels.

Brussels, however, is pressing ahead. The European Union’s FuelEU Maritime initiative seeks to accelerate the uptake of low-emission energy sources, positioning the bloc as a frontrunner in maritime climate policy. This divergence creates both risk and opportunity: while the absence of a global standard complicates planning, it also opens the door for Europe to set the pace.

Among the options under consideration, clean ammonia is emerging as a credible candidate for deep-sea shipping. Its potential role in the energy transition was the focus of a recent event hosted by Ammonia Europe and Euractiv on 30 October.

Key messages underscored the need for the EU to seize this opportunity and define effective decarbonization strategies. A full value chain consideration is crucial for addressing the entire ammonia ecosystem, with joined-up policies like the EU Maritime Industrial Strategy and the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP) needed to enhance clean ammonia markets.

The discussions included perspectives from experts in sustainability, policy, and technology, focusing on the essential questions about the implications of the IMO delay, the role of ammonia in decarbonization, and how EU policies can facilitate clean ammonia adoption while ensuring its availability and affordability.

These dialogues highlighted the intersection of innovation, regulation, and economic growth within the maritime sector’s shift toward cleaner fuels.

Reduce costs, accelerate transition

Ammonia produced using renewable and low-carbon energy emits no carbon when combusted and benefits from an existing global production and trade network. Leveraging this infrastructure could help reduce costs and accelerate the transition to cleaner fuels – provided that production, safety, and environmental standards are robustly managed. By investing in ammonia-ready vessels and infrastructure, the EU could become a leader in global innovation.

Manuela Tomassini, head of the sustainability and technical assistance department at European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA), kicked off the event with a keynote speech that examined the sector’s current trajectory and the safety considerations around ammonia.

“As we explore clean ammonia’s potential, and we look into pathways to enable ammonia for green shipping, sharing lessons learned and working together across the industry and regulators will be essential to ensure progress that is both sustainable and safe,” said Tomassini.

“After the recent events at IMO, we really need to keep the momentum, and we need to take every possible opportunity to remind all of us that the current climate crisis is still ongoing… It still requires decisive and undoubted measures to be adopted, and it still requires commitment and engagement by all relevant stakeholders,” she said.

As of September 2025, 154 ammonia-fuelled vessels and 261 ammonia-ready vessels have been ordered, added Tomassini, before saying more work must be done.

Tech neutrality

Moises Blanco Rios, a policy officer for clean transport transitions at the European Commission’s research and innovation directorate (DG RTD), echoed Tomassini.

“The European Commission continues to focus on competitiveness on sustainability, and also safety, which is going to be key for this issue. Our approach is very clear. We’re technology neutral. Ammonia can be a piece of the puzzle to decarbonise the industry. In RTD, our goal is to try to solve all the technical challenges that are coming along the way, and we look forward to continuing to resolve them,” he said.

MEP Sérgio Gonçalves, a member of the transport and tourism committee in the European Parliament representing the island region of Madeira, underlined the maritime sector’s local and economic importance. He highlighted that shipping decarbonisation translates into real impacts and opportunities for EU citizens and coastal communities.

“The European Union has been leading the effort to decarbonise the maritime sector. However, this is a fight that we cannot win alone. This is why it was deeply disappointing that the International Maritime Organisation decided to delay the vote on its decarbonisation framework following the pressure from the United States.”

“Shipping knows no borders, as we know, and neither does the fight against climate change. An international framework would allow us to reduce emissions more effectively and ensure that companies and operators working in European waters are not disproportionately burdened. That said, we must not lose momentum. The new IMO vote is scheduled for 2026, and the EU and its member states should exert their full diplomatic weight to secure an agreement next year,” said Gonçalves.

“It is not feasible for islands or other small-scale regions to locally produce multiple fuels or to pay for their transportation and maintain separate storage, bunkering, and refuelling infrastructures. Therefore, ideally, we would have one or two primary fuels for ship,s and if not, we should at least ensure shared interoperable infrastructures,” he added.

Zero emissions

Dr Domagoj Baresic, a senior research fellow at the University College London Energy Institute, explained his work tracking progress along the lines of adoption of zero-emission or scalable zero-emission fuels together with a team of researchers.

“The way we do the analysis, I think, is quite pertinent to this discussion. Because, beyond the IMO, there is the European Union, there are national actions, and there are other aspects that are quite important in terms of managing expectations and in terms of mobilising support for these fuels. And this is specifically true for ammonia as well. So, I would say the discussion has to continue, especially from a European Union perspective,” he said.

Finally, Roy Campe, chief technology officer at CMB.TECH – a member of Ammonia Europe – gave a hands-on industry insight into how global trends, EU policy, and technological innovation are shaping real-world decarbonisation and investment decisions in the maritime sector.

“CNBtech is a diversified, future-proof maritime group. We have about 250 seagoing ships, which consume a lot of fuel. I can tell you we are using about three billion litres of diesel on a yearly basis, with assets that are quite powerful, sailing 6,000 hours a year, and have a typical lifetime of 20 years. So, you can imagine that the question for us is ‘what should we be owning as an owner? How can we make money? And we believe it’s not on a pure diesel ship’”, explained Campe.

“We need to look ahead when we invest. If you buy a diesel ship today, you lock in your emissions for the next 20 years. We believe that should be different. How do we build future-proof assets? It has to run on clean fuel. And I believe one of the clear winners for big ships will be ammonia,” he concluded.

Despite US economic threats, The Pacific Islands walked out of the meeting in protest, with Vanuatu’s Minister for Climate Change condemning the delay as “unacceptable given the urgency we face in light of accelerating climate change”. Meanwhile, the world’s largest polluter, China, initially supported the NZF in April but reversed its stance this October after strong opposition from the US.

With over 100,000 commercial vessels and millions of smaller marine crafts, decarbonizing this sector is a significant challenge. Pressures are increasing, specially as global trade is expected to double by 2050, while the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has mandated a 50% reduction in emissions compared to 2008 levels. In essence, the industry must achieve deep decarbonization while continuing to grow operations, delivering more shipments with fewer emissions.

The shipping industry’s emissions challenge

To meet these targets without slowing growth, the industry has started to uncover the vast potential of marine batteries. Today, different watercraft require batteries for diverse applications such as propulsion systems, auxiliary power, and power back-ups.

Marine batteries: A game-changer for decarbonization

Replacing traditional fuels with batteries is helping the marine industry in reducing emissions, maintenance costs, noise pollution, and also enhance operational efficiency, resulting in a more sustainable and environmentally friendly marine industry. Marine batteries result in –

Innovative battery solutions leading the charge

Take, for instance, the world’s first battery-powered container ship – a 700 TEU vessel launched by Cosco Shipping in May 2023. This 10,000-DWT river/coastal ship is powered by container-sized batteries and two 900 kW propulsion motors. With a Length Overall (LOA) of 119.8 meters, it cuts emissions by about 32 tons per day compared to conventional fuel ships. In addition to zero emissions, it operates without noise, marking a milestone in green, carbon-neutral shipping. In some cases, the impact is already tangible.

EnerSys – a key player in the marine batteries market has launched its NexSys PURE Thin Plate Pure Lead (TPPL) battery that helps reduce the unexpected operating costs by eliminating the need for watering, thereby cutting unplanned downtime and labor associated with conventional lead-acid batteries. These batteries can be fast-charged in <2 hours, and are 10% more energy dense.

Leclanché’s Marine Rack System (MRS), powered by lithium-ion cell batteries, was developed especially for the maritime industry and will reduce the ships’ consumption of fossil fuels by 40%.

Asia-Pacific: The epicenter of marine electrification

The marine fleet is anchored by the Asia-Pacific region. There are several facts to back this up. More than half of the world’s ship carrying capacity is owned in Asia, naturally positioning the region as the prime hub for marine electrification.

The same trend is reflected in the global marine battery market as well, since, in value terms, the global sector crossed USD 505 million in 2024, with over USD 340 million; that is – nearly 60% of the total value coming from APAC alone.

The reason behind such humongous demand can be attributed to the nature of trade, wherein short sea and coasting shipping, particularly in China and Southeast Asia, operates on fixed routes, perfectly suited to battery integration.

Furthermore, as per Marine Insights, China alone controls over 62% of the global orderbook in 2025, with 3,454 vessels worth 175.4 million gross ton (GT). Apart from China, APAC countries including South Korea, Japan, etc. together account for the bulk of global newbuild orders.

Just in the first half of 2025, Chinese yards secured 402 newbuild orders, South Korea followed with 117 orders, and Japan, though smaller, but held ~11% of total orders.

On the top of that, governments across the region are tightening emissions rules in major ports, aligning with International Maritime Organization (IMO) decarbonization targets and nudging shipowners toward hybrid and battery solutions.

Now that we’re talking about the IMO and decarbonization, Europe won’t be lagging behind either. The region has been proactively advancing marine battery adoption, driven by stringent emission control regulations, IMO-aligned decarbonization targets, and incentives for greener shipping practices. As a result, the region now represents ~13% of the global marine battery market, reflecting steady growth in alignment with both regulatory pressure and sustainability commitments.

Cargo ships: The backbone of battery adoption

According to UNCTAD’s Review of Maritime Transport 2024, the global fleet comprised nearly 109,000 vessels at the start of 2024, carrying over 2.35 billion deadweight tons (DWT). This fleet is expected to grow by 2.5% in 2025. Cargo ships, including bulk carriers, oil tankers, and container ships, dominate, accounting for 88% of the world’s fleet capacity and serving as the engines of global trade. The fleet averaged 22.4 years in 2024, with over half of the vessels older than 15 years, leading to higher emissions and fuel consumption.

Owners are addressing this by retrofitting or ordering new builds, with 387 deliveries expected in 2025, 529 in 2026, and 419 from 2027 onward. Global trade, valued at $300 billion in early 2025, continues to drive fleet expansion. Cargo vessels, as the backbone of seaborne trade, will remain the largest consumers of marine batteries, supporting the energy transition.

Material matters: The evolution of marine battery technology

Though, material choices for marine batteries include Lead-acid batteries (Flooded, VRLA-Gel, and VRLA-AGM), Lithium-ion batteries, and Nickel-cadmium batteries, >85% of marine batteries are made of lead acid materials, especially Valve Regulated – Absorbed Glass Mat (VRLA-AGM), due to their proven reliability, cost-effectiveness, and ability to handle high cranking currents, making them ideal for onboard auxiliary services and starting diesel engines.

Lead-acid batteries remain dominant in maritime operations due to their reliability and cost-effectiveness. EnerSys’ NexSys PURE TPPL batteries reduce operating costs, while PowerSafe SBS batteries offer long-life and high-energy density. Lithium-ion batteries are gaining traction for their superior energy density and minimal maintenance. Without policy action, shipping’s GHG emissions could grow 50% by 2050, contradicting IMO’s net-zero targets. The IMO emphasizes that over 60% of CO₂ cuts must come from alternative fuels. Batteries, as part of the zero-carbon toolkit, are ideal for short routes and hybrid systems, though full electrification of large ships remains unrealistic. Marine batteries are poised for significant growth, driving decarbonization and sustainability in the shipping industry over the coming years.

Navigating challenges in the marine battery supply chain

The marine battery supply chain faces raw material shortages, production bottlenecks, and limited charging infrastructure. In addition, the tariff-driven cost hikes such as US import duties on lithium-ion batteries reaching 104%, have also resulted in significant price increases, delays, and uneven access.

However, in response to a few supply chain challenges and to meet the growing batteries demand, the battery industry is focusing on possible substitutes such as Li-air or Li-sulphur, etc.

The future of marine batteries: Toward a greener ocean

Lastly, by revolutionizing marine transport, enabling cleaner, efficient, and sustainable operations worldwide, the global marine batteries market will become a critical pillar of the future maritime ecosystem. the global marine battery market is poised for growth, projected to surge from ~USD 505 million in 2024 to reach USD 615 million in 2030.

While too many politicians falter and forsake in their climate responsibility, the world needs urgent climate action.","IN OCTOBER, members of the International Maritime Organization shocked the world by delaying by one year the adoption of one of the biggest global climate policy breakthroughs in recent years: the IMO Net-Zero Framework (NZF).

The NZF is historic because it is set to be the world’s first meaningful global carbon price on any industry polluter. This rather complex mechanism consists of gradually increasing carbon intensity targets (a technical element) and penalty fees for non-compliance with these targets (an economic element). Crucially, as an amendment of Annex VI of the existing Marpol Convention, it will be legally-binding for all international ships over 5,000 gt.

The NZF is the single most important tool the IMO has to achieve its 2023 Revised Strategy goals, which countries agreed requires both economic and technical measures. It would also generate real action and substantial finance, which three decades of COP meetings have failed to deliver.

While the NZF adoption in October was expected to be a formality, since a clear majority of countries agreed to the text at MEPC83 in April, this all collapsed within a week of negotiations under relentless pressure from the opposition. This was namely delaying tactics by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the US reported threats to IMO member states, especially to the most vulnerable countries in the Caribbean, Africa, and the Pacific.

Many oil producer countries strongly oppose the NZF since they sell around 300m tonnes of fuel to the shipping industry every year. Whether crude oil serves as a feedstock for energy, plastics, or petrochemical applications, it will produce heavy fuel oil as a toxic byproduct of refineries. If ships stop using this sludge for propulsion, refineries would have to dispose of it at a cost, rather than sell it for profit.

Crucially, however, the opponents to the NZF failed to achieve their ultimate goal: to garner enough support among countries to reject the agreement in its entirety. Instead, they proposed and won a vote to adjourn the decision by one year (out of 127 countries at the meeting, 57 voted for a delay, 49 voted against, and 21 abstained).

Despite these pressures, a strong coalition of countries, including Pacific Islands, Brazil, Chile, Namibia, Mexico, Seychelles, DR Congo, the UK, Mexico, Canada, and the European Union remain committed to adopting the NZF as soon as possible.

What happens in the next 12 months lies solely in the hands of the IMO members, and here are five options of how it could play out.

Five possible scenarios for 2026

First, the best possible outcome for the NZF is its survival through a majority vote to adopt next year. On top of being adopted, survival also requires using a “tacit” acceptance procedure. This means that the NZF enters into force automatically, unless 1/3 of MARPOL Annex VI parties (who account for 50% of tonnage) explicitly oppose. This has been common practice for the IMO’s decision-making since the 1970s.

The second option is to keep the NZF in its current state: in a coma. This would require a majority vote to again adjourn the discussions when they resume. It’s a straightforward and likely scenario that would keep the NZF in the running, but not implemented. However, though with every further delay, the chance of it ever being adopted shrinks. Meanwhile, fragmentation of action for shipping decarbonization, will continue to spread notably beyond the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, creating a patchwork of measures for the shipping industry to comply with.

The third option is the death of the NZF, through a majority vote against adoption among MARPOL Annex VI parties, which is the outcome the opposition camp was not able to find a majority for in October. However, only a handful of states with little interest in climate action would want to go on the record for having killed the NZF, making this outcome unlikely. Though the NZF’s death would create clarity and momentum to start drafting a new measure.

The most disastrous option: the NZF could turn into a zombie. This fourth scenario would require a majority vote in favour of adopting the NZF through the uncommon “explicit” acceptance procedure. Explicit procedure means that the NZF would enter into force only if a set threshold of countries (⅔ MARPOL Annex VI parties and flag states representing 50% of global tonnage) explicitly declare their acceptance to the IMO. The NZF would be alive (because “adopted”) but dead (because it would face the high risk of never being “accepted”, which is required for it to enter into force). Such an “empty shell” outcome is a more elegant option for opponents who want to quietly kill the NZF, since countries would need time and political commitment to go through national procedures, this option would make entry into force altogether unlikely.

Finally, the fifth version of the NZF is a mutant that re-opens political discussion. This would lead to delays that undermine the phase out of fossil fuels and would make a just and equitable transition even more challenging, which is a red line for many least developed countries and small island developing states. Moreover, any substantive changes would trigger a new vote on “agreement”, followed by a vote on “adoption” six months later.

What will it take?

The IMO as an organisation is caught in a double bind. On the one hand, it needs to ensure institutional survival in an increasingly challenging geopolitical context. On the other hand, it needs to deliver on its commitments on climate action — including the 2023 GHG Strategy, which its members unanimously adopted. The role of the IMO’s secretary-general and the MEPC chair will be more critical than ever in 2026.

A zombie NZF would also undermine the IMO well-functioning mechanism of tacit acceptance. Changing the adoption process to explicit also sets a dangerous precedent for any future policies, not only climate regulations, to be adopted “explicitly”, weakening the IMO as a global regulator.

A mutant NZF without an economic element would kneecap the green transition for shipping, both in terms of phasing out fossil fuels and delivering it in a just and equitable manner.

Neither death, coma, zombie nor mutant could be seen as a success for climate change.

The the only credible way forward is to get the NZF adopted in 2026. It’s difficult but possible.

It will require strong unity of IMO members committed to climate action, further clarity on the guidelines and implementation of the NZF and its fund, as well as procedural fairness (which was missing on so many levels throughout the negotiations) both inside and outside the IMO building.

While too many politicians falter and forsake in their climate responsibility, the world needs urgent climate action. Delivering this requires unwavering commitment, by everyone at the IMO. The NZF is a hard-fought compromise that deserves survival so it can be strengthened as soon as possible.

by Benny Hilström, vice president of market development, WinGD

With or without the IMO Net Zero Framework, LNG remains a viable transition pathway towards decarbonization and, with X-DF technology, ultra-low air pollution.

Going into the extraordinary session of IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee in mid-October, many in the industry had high hopes that the Net Zero Framework (NZF) would be adopted. WinGD was and remains one of the believers; incentivising the production and uptake of clean fuels is the only way to meet both IMO emissions ambitions and wider global climate targets.

The NZF does not mean, as some have suggested, that the case for LNG fuel or for installing dual-fuel LNG technology is over. Just like our X-DF-A ammonia-fueled and X-DF-M methanol-fueled engines, our X-DF dual-fuel LNG engines are ready to use zero or near-zero emissions (ZNZ) fuels. In the case of LNG those ZNZ fuels are bio-methane and e-methane, produced using captured carbon and renewable electricity, which can be used without modification and in any blend in X-DF engines.

Had the NZF been adopted with reduction targets and penalties stringent enough to drive people towards bio-methane, and rewards high enough to encourage e-methane production and use, the transition towards those fuels would have come sooner. A pause in implementing the policy only pushes the transition from fossil LNG further down the road.

That is why the NZF delay has made more operators consider LNG propulsion. Without a global carbon pricing policy and immediate e-fuel incentives, it remains the most affordable, widely available and well-established of all marine alternative fuels. Even fossil LNG can push vessels a long way towards the 30% reduction in emissions sought by 2030—an intermediate checkpoint under IMO’s GHG reduction strategy (which remains in place even after the NZF vote postponement).

WinGD’s X-DF concept has been in service since 2016, with more than 900 engines sold. Over that time we have amassed more than 8 million running hours of experience and continuously refined fuel consumption and emissions performance via innovations including iCER and VCR technology.

Advancing GHG reduction benefits

Take methane slip as an example. In less than a decade we have reduced slippage by 60%, thanks to iCER, VCR and other design adaptations. Combined with low fuel consumption, this means that X-DF outperforms current high-pressure LNG engines in total greenhouse gas emissions in several vessel applications. In even more applications, low opex and initial system costs mean that total vessel lifecycle costs remain lower for X-DF than for high-pressure counterparts, regardless of IMO penalties.

Time in the market and continuous improvement have enabled us to develop an engine platform that will yield the best performance whether operating in fossil LNG or biological or synthetic derivatives. Regardless of the status of NZF, those years of refinements will pay dividends for operators choosing methane.

What happens next is far from clear. If the global framework were to fail, a patchwork of regional regulatory regimes would likely follow. Across several regions, port authorities are working to lower air pollution in their communities. It is therefore possible that, as regions regulate, they expand the scope of emissions policy to include not only GHG but also air pollutants.

In such a case, X-DF again has benefits for operators, offering the best air pollution profile of any LNG dual-fuel engine. That includes SOx, NOx and particulate matter. While IMO’s threshold requirements for NOx and SOx hide X-DF’s advantages, under schemes where operators pay for polluting the air, its low emissions profile would translate to real cost savings.

The Net Zero Framework would not have killed the use of LNG, but its pause certainly enhances the business case. Regardless, WinGD’s near decade of optimizing the X-DF platform means operators will pay less, whether they use fossil LNG or transition to cleaner variants. And it opens up new opportunities for air pollution improvements that could also have a significant financial impact on operators.",https://www.marinelog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Benny-Hilstrom-Vice-President-of-Market-Development-WinGD.jpg,N,,2025-11-18 11:56:31.688008

Achieving this requires close collaboration among stakeholders to develop practical solutions, fuels and infrastructure for a balanced and realistic transition. Without a global framework, there is a real risk of fragmentation through regional or unilateral measures, which could increase costs, reduce competitiveness and create regulatory uncertainty. CSC’s role is to navigate this complexity while safeguarding Cyprus’s position as a leading maritime hub.

S4S: What is your vision for the maritime sector for the next 5 years and your key priorities?

A.J.: Our primary goal remains to promote and safeguard the legitimate interests of our Members and of Cyprus Shipping as a whole. Over the next five years, we aim to strengthen policies that ensure a viable, resilient and globally competitive Cyprus Shipping Industry. A cornerstone of this effort is our close cooperation with the Shipping Deputy Ministry, which has been critical in establishing Cyprus as a respected international shipping hub. By deepening this partnership, we can proactively address emerging challenges, seize new opportunities and enhance both the competitiveness and sustainability of our sector. I look forward to continuing this collaboration with a shared commitment to continued excellence.

S4S: What do you see as the biggest opportunities and challenges related to the human element in shipping’s decarbonisation journey?

A.J.: The biggest opportunities and challenges lie in workforce adaptation and capability-building. As the Shipping Industry transitions into a smart-shipping era, with increased digitalisation and automation, companies are aligning their strategies with these technological changes. The opportunity is clear: by investing in upskilling and reskilling, the workforce can drive innovation, efficiency and the successful adoption of decarbonisation solutions. The challenge is ensuring the workforce can adapt fast enough to keep pace with evolving technologies while maintaining safety and competitiveness.

S4S: What needs to change to raise industry’s profile and attract future talents?

A.J.: Our industry has made significant strides in raising awareness of shipping and promoting career opportunities. At the Cyprus Shipping Chamber, we have a long-standing commitment to maritime education through a three-tiered approach, targeting students from primary school to high school. Initiatives like our successful ‘Adopt a Ship’ Programme, now in its 19th year and targeting 10-12 year old children, high school presentations explaining shipping careers in simple and engaging terms, participation in career fairs and support for cadets and maritime graduates in finding employment demonstrate this commitment. Continuing and expanding these efforts is essential to attracting talent and further raising the industry’s profile in Cyprus.

S4S: Do you have any new developments/ or any new projects on the pipeline that you would like to share with the industry?

A.J.: The Cyprus Shipping Chamber is planning a series of initiatives for 2026 to further elevate the profile of Cyprus Shipping. In parallel with Cyprus’ upcoming Presidency of the European Commission, the Chamber will be actively involved in key local and European projects and events to highlight the strategic importance of our industry. These include high-level business functions for industry executives, government officials, and Member-Companies, as well as social and community events under our CSR programme. Together, these initiatives aim to strengthen industry engagement, promote Cyprus as a leading maritime hub, and attract both local and international stakeholders.

S4S: What is your key message to industry stakeholders to foster a more sustainable future for shipping?

A.J.: Real progress towards a sustainable future for shipping requires coordinated action across all industry stakeholders. The path to decarbonisation will be the industry’s foremost challenge and the onus should not be borne by the shipowners alone. In particular, fuel suppliers must come forward with Zero or Near Zero fuels if the end goal for a net zero emissions shipping is to be achieved. On a local level, the Chamber’s members represent the majority of Cyprus’s leading shipping companies, contributing around 7% to the Cyprus GDP, providing onboard employment to over 80,000 seafarers globally at any one time and 5,000 employees ashore. The industry’s voice and expertise, expressed through the Chamber, must continue to be present and be heard. Close collaboration should focus on aligning incentives, sharing knowledge and developing practical solutions that safeguard this key pillar of the Cyprus economy, ensuring its continued growth, competitiveness and long-term viability.

Olsen Cruise Lines has welcomed UK government officials and energy stakeholders aboard Borealis for a roundtable discussion hosted by CLIA, focused on accelerating the cruise industry’s path to net zero

The event, held at Portsmouth International Port Cruise Terminal, brought together voices from across the energy and transport sectors, including the Energy Networks Association, Ofgem, the National Energy System Operator, and officials from the Department for Transport and the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero.

Chaired by CLIA, the roundtable provided a forum to explore methods for achieving the cruise sector’s goal of net zero emissions by 2050, in alignment with the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) 2023 strategy for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from ships.

Attendees discussed the cruise industry’s evolving energy landscape and the role of Onshore Power Supply (OPS) in this transition. OPS enables ships to draw electricity from the grid while berthed, significantly reducing in-port emissions. Portsmouth’s OPS system, currently under installation, is projected to cut carbon emissions by 20,000 metric tonnes annually from 2027.

Mike Sellers, director at Portsmouth International Port, said: “It’s evident there is a real appetite for sustainable fuel technology. While delivering this innovative system is not without its challenges, it was great to know that there’s a support and willingness for this to be a success.”

Fred. Olsen Cruise Lines utilises OPS wherever available across its equipped sister ships – Borealis and Bolette – while investing in low-carbon technologies, like silicone-based hull coatings and advanced propeller systems designed to improve hydrodynamic efficiency and fuel performance.

Samantha Stimpson, CEO of Fred. Olsen Cruise Lines, said: “We are proud to have hosted this important discussion aboard Borealis and help shape the cruise industry’s path toward net zero emissions. Achieving net zero by 2050 is ambitious, which makes events like this vital for identifying practical strategies and collaborative solutions.

“For us, sustainability is more than a goal – it’s a responsibility. By adopting solutions such as shore power and working hand in hand with government and industry partners, we can make meaningful progress in reducing our impact and protecting the oceans we sail and the destinations we’re privileged to visit.”

Andy Harmer OBE, managing director of CLIA UK & Ireland, added: “The Roundtable hosted onboard Borealis was a great opportunity to discuss the importance of Onshore Power Supply which is a crucial component of our industry’s decarbonisation journey. Over 50 per cent of the global cruise fleet is already able to plug in, allowing ships to turn off their engines for emissions reductions of up to 98 per cent.

This study was conducted on a low-speed, two-stroke, in-line six-cylinder diesel engine used as the main propulsion system of a 9,196-ton class passenger vessel for international voyages. The engine delivers an output of 6,618 kW at a maximum speed of 146 RPM and uses Bunker A fuel, which is a blend of 70% diesel and 30% heavy fuel oil. The experimental vessel departed from its home port, Mokpo, Republic of Korea, and sailed in coastal waters. Data were collected in various operational modes during the navigation. Table 1 lists the detailed specifications of the vessel and engine used in the experiments.

During vessel operation, the actual CO2, CO, and NOX emission data were collected from the exhaust gases emitted by the main propulsion engine. The engine operating data were obtained from the alarm monitoring system (AMS), which comprehensively manages and monitors the operational data of the vessel’s machinery. The AMS collects and monitors the real-time machinery status through various sensors installed during ship construction, enabling the verification of each piece of machinery’s operating conditions and functional status. The OBS-ONE-GS12 HDV model (Horiba Ltd., Kyoto, Japan) was used to measure gas emissions, and continuous measurements were conducted for the device’s maximum operational duration (4 h) during the voyage. The measurement device was calibrated before and after the measurement, and because the exhaust gas from the main propulsion engine of the vessel contained significantly more particulate matter than that from road mobiles, the internal filter was replaced every 4 h to maintain measurement reliability. The emission measurement method was designed following the IMO Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) guidelines. CO2 and CO were measured using a nondispersive infrared (NDIR) method, and NOX was measured via chemiluminescence detection (CLD)25. The detailed specifications of portable emission measurement system (PEMS) are provided in Table 2.

AMS and PEMS data were synchronized during acquisition, a residual latency between the two systems cannot be entirely excluded because of sensor response and signal processing delays in the PEMS. In this study, the latency was considered negligible relative to the 0.1 Hz sampling interval; therefore, no explicit alignment correction was applied. However, for broader development, quantifying the time offset between AMS and PEMS and adjusting the window alignment accordingly is recommended to ensure robust training and real time applicability.

Figure 1 shows a schematic of the data acquisition process. Data were collected over the entire operational sections of the vessel, including arrival and departure. The collected data include engine operating conditions and actual measured emission data. The engine operation data comprise 104 variables, including the RPM, torque, power, exhaust gas temperature for each cylinder, and maximum combustion pressure. These were compiled with the CO2, CO, and NOX emission data into a database. The data sample rate of the AMS was set to 0.1 Hz, resulting in 7,147 samples. Among them, 3389 samples were used as the training set, and the remaining 3758 samples were allocated to the test set for the prediction model.

The modeling was conducted in a controlled computing environment to ensure efficient training of the proposed deep learning models, reproducibility, and to clearly define the constraints on scalability. The hardware configuration included an Intel Core i9-10900KF CPU and 32 GB of RAM. The software environment consisted of Python version 3.9.13 running on window 10 Pro 64-bit. Detailed hardware and software specifications are summarized in Table 3.

Prediction modeling with TSF-Transformer and XGBoost

Figure 2 shows a flowchart for developing the stacking emission prediction model based on TSF-Transformer and XGBoost. The entire dataset was divided into training (3389 rows) and test (3758 rows) samples, with each dataset including different operational modes—from dead slow to full navigation. Nonnumerical fields and missing values were removed from the raw data to minimize errors during model training, and min–max scaling was applied to improve the learning stability and convergence speed. LASSO-based feature selection was performed to identify key input features that affect the target variables, and the final input dataset was constructed based on the selected features. Furthermore, the hyperparameters for both the TSF-Transformer and XGBoost were optimized through K-Fold cross-validation (k = 5) using the Optuna framework. Based on the obtained results, a stacking-structured prediction model was developed, and its performance was evaluated using the test dataset.

Figure 3 shows the structure of the proposed stacking prediction model. Input features selected using LASSO are structured into time-series sequences and fed into the encoder block of the TSF-Transformer, which captures the temporal dependencies using multi-head attention and feedforward layers. Simultaneously, the same features are used to train an XGBoost regression model, and each model performs an initial prediction independently. Subsequently, the predictions from the Transformer and XGBoost models and their first-order differences are combined to form the meta input, which is then fed into the final XGBoost-based meta-model to produce the final prediction. This ensemble structure compensates for the weaknesses of individual models while leveraging their complementary strengths, thereby improving both prediction performance and robustness.

Table 4 lists the optimal combination of hyperparameters for the proposed model. To maximize the prediction performance of the proposed model, the Optuna framework was used to perform hyperparameter optimization using a Bayesian optimizer based on the tree-structured Parzen estimator (TPE). For each hyperparameter combination, five-fold cross-validation was performed. In each fold, the TSF-Transformer was first trained, followed by the construction of meta-inputs using its output along with the XGBoost predictions and their first-order differences. Based on these inputs, the final metal model was trained. During validation, the objective function of Optuna was defined to minimize the RMSE. Because CO2, CO, and NOX have distinct time-series characteristics, scales, and combinations of influential variables, optimal hyperparameter tuning was performed separately for each target. The final optimized combination of hyperparameters improved the prediction accuracy while preventing overfitting in each prediction model, providing a basis for designing the optimal structure for each target. The training time for each model was also recorded to indicate the computational demand of the proposed approach. Specifically, the training required 108.21 s for the CO2 model, 40.79 s for the CO model, and 24.24 s for the NOX model. These results confirm that, even with a training dataset of 3389 samples and the adopted hyperparameter configurations, the training process can be completed efficiently within a relatively short time on the specified hardware environment.

Training variables for each emission’s prediction model

LASSO feature selection was employed to identify the most influential input variables for prediction each pollutants. The final sets of selected features are summarized in Tables 5, 6 and 7. For the CO2 emission prediction model, a total 50 variables were selected, including fuel consumption and main engine air cooler cooling water outlet temperature. For the CO prediction model, 15 variables were used, including main engine load, whereas 27 variables were applied for the NOX prediction model. All input data, excluding the emission measurements, were derived from vessel operation information acquired through the alarm monitoring system at a sampling frequency of 0.1 Hz.

For CO emissions, previous studies (Will et al., 2007; Yan et al., 2021) have reported that the intake pressure of diesel engines significantly affects CO formation26,27. Based on this evidence, adding combustion-specific variables was considered, namely the average maximum cylinder pressure and the average cylinder compression pressure, in addition to the LASSO-selected features. However, the experimental results revealed that including these combustion-specific variables did not improve model performance; instead, the prediction accuracy deteriorated in terms quantitative indicators such as MAE and RMSE. This suggests that the additional features may have introduced noise or redundancy that hindered effective learning. Consequently, these variables were excluded from the final model. Nevertheless, it is anticipated that incorporating other combustion-specific parameters not included in this study—such as fuel injection timing and injection pressure—could further enhance the accuracy and robustness of CO emission prediction in future work.

The influence of the selected variables differed depending on the target pollutant. Some variables directly contributed to increasing emissions (LASSO, +), whereas others acted as suppressing factors(LASSO, -). Notably, the experimental vessel was equipped with a controllable pitch propeller (CPP), allowing the propeller angle to be adjusted for propulsion. Variances in the CPP pitch were found to affect emission formation; an increase in propeller pitch tended to reduce CO2 and NOX emissions, but conversely led to an increase in CO emissions. This indicates that CPP dynamics exert a nonlinear influence on combustion conditions and exhaust gas formation. Accordingly, the same input variable can exert opposite effects depending on the emission species, highlighting the limitation of using a single independent variable sets and optimization procedures for each pollutant, which substantially improved the overall predictive performance of the proposed model.

Bottom–up emission prediction approach

We compared the performance of the proposed model with that of the bottom–up approach reported by the IMO and EEA, which is commonly used to calculate vessel emissions. The bottom–up method estimates fuel consumption based on vessel characteristics and operational data to calculate emissions. It exhibits higher accuracy than the top–down approach, which relies solely on fuel sales data28,29,30.

To calculate fuel consumption, information about the engine load and power from vessel activity data is essential. Based on the load data obtained from the AMS, the fuel consumption was calculated using the method proposed by the IMO. The specific fuel oil consumption (SFOC) according to the load can be expressed as follows:

$$\:{SFOC}_{load}={SFOC}_{baseline}\times\:\left(0.4555\times\:{load}^{2}-0.71\times\:load+1.28\right),$$

(1)

where SFOCload ​is the SFOC under the engine load (g/kWh), and SFOCbaseline is the SFOC as fuel (g/kWh). In this study, Burker A was used as fuel in the slow-speed engine. It was consumed at 175 g/kWh31.

Using the SFOCload calculated in Eq. (1) and the engine power data, the fuel consumption can be estimated as follows:

$$\:{q}_{f}={SFOC}_{load}\times\:P,$$

(2)

where qf is the fuel consumption (g), and P is the engine power (kW).

According to the IMO and EEA, CO2 and CO emissions can be calculated by multiplying the fuel consumption by the emission factor (EF), as expressed in Eq. (3). However, the EEA calculates NOX emissions by multiplying the fuel consumption by EF, whereas the IMO calculates using Eq. (4). The EF values for various pollutants are listed in Table 8. Although the IMO does not explicitly define Bunker A as s separate fuel category, it is generally considered as a residual fuel oil with properties similar to low-sulphur heavy fuel oil. Accordingly, the emission factors were selected based on the default carbon content and fuel-specific coefficient reported in the Fourth IMO GHG Study (2020) and the IMO NOX Technical Code (2008), which are applicable to residual marine fuel.

$$\:{EM}_{i}=FC\times\:{EF}_{i},$$

(3)

where EM is the emission quantity (g), and i indicates the emission type.

$$\:{EM}_{NOx}={EF}_{NOx}\times\:\frac{{SFOC}_{base}}{{SFOC}_{CG}}\times\:P,$$

(4)

where EFNOx is the emission factor for NOx, and SFOCCG is the SFOC value proposed by Cooper and Gustanffson (2004)32,33.

The prediction performance of the proposed model was evaluated by comparing the emissions estimated using the proposed model and the bottom–up methods proposed by the IMO and EEA.

Figure 4 shows the correlation between SFOC and load according to the engine RPM. The correlation follows a cubic relationship or the propeller law34. Typically, for vessels with medium- to large-scale low-speed engines, the engine is directly connected to the propeller without a reduction gear. Here, the SFOC was higher under low-speed, low-load conditions during maneuvering and lower under high-speed, high-load conditions during sailing. This result can be attributed to the reduced thermal efficiency under low engine loads due to the lower fuel injection pressure, suboptimal fuel injection timing, and insufficient scavenging air for combustion35. However, as shown in the yellow-shaded area of Figure 4(a), some data deviate from the general trend, which can be attributed to the fact that the experimental vessel was equipped with a CPP rather than a fixed-pitch propeller (FPP) for propulsion. CPPs allow thrust adjustment by varying the propeller pitch while maintaining constant engine RPM. The variations in the propeller pitch in those sections result in nonlinear fuel consumption patterns. Excluding such sections, Figure 4(b) shows a pattern consistent with the propeller law typically observed for FPPs. In this study, the entire operational dataset, including the sections affected by pitch variations, was used for training to ensure generalized performance under diverse operating conditions. However, the 100–120 RPM range is classified as a critical RPM zone due to structural resonance issues in the engine. In actual operations, it is avoided to prevent mechanical damage to the engine. In this range, the sudden increase in fuel injection rate can cause a transient rise in exhaust gas pressure, potentially leading to measurement errors in the PEMS. In addition, non-physical or unrealistic values from the AMS and PEMS (e.g., abnormal emission spikes, sensor malfunctions) were identified through cross-checking with engineering and temporal continuity, and subsequently removed. This screening process ensured that only physically meaningful and consistent data were used for model training.

Figure 5 shows the operational activity of the experimental vessel during the measurements. In certain sections, changes in the propeller pitch resulted in differences in the load and speed despite the constant RPM. These sections correspond to the deviations from the trend in Figure 4(a). These results indicate that, unlike FPPs, CPPs require additional variables for accurate emission calculations. Therefore, we included such sections in the training data and constructed the prediction model accordingly. In the sections not affected by the CPP, pitch, load, and speed varied in a similar pattern with respect to the RPM. Although minor differences were observed, the trend is similar to that of FPPs. Therefore, the proposed prediction model based on CPPs can exhibit comparable performance when applied to vessels with FPPs. This will be verified in future studies by collecting vessel operation and emission data without variations in the propeller pitch.

In addition, a SHAP-based sensitivity analysis was conducted to compare the CPP-affected segments with non-affected ones. The results show that the contribution of the propeller pitch variable exhibited no significant change between the two segments, indicating that the model did not rely heavily on pitch variation for prediction (see Supplementary Fig. S1–S3). This suggests that the proposed model retains generalizability and can adapt to vessels equipped with FPP without retraining.

The prediction results obtained using the proposed hybrid prediction model were compared with the emissions estimated using the conventional bottom–up approaches reported by IMO and EEA and those measured using a PEMS. Figures 6(a)–(c) compare the measured and predicted emissions for each pollutant. The magnified areas in the figures highlight representative segments where the differences in model performance are pronounced. Overall, the proposed model outperformed the bottom–up methods, especially under dynamic conditions.

As shown in Figure 6(a), the CO2 emissions estimated by the IMO and EEA approaches are identical because the same EF and equation are used in both cases. Both methods significantly underestimated CO2 emissions compared to the measured values, especially under high-load conditions. In contrast, the proposed model estimated CO2 emissions close to the measured values not only under high-load conditions but also during transient events, such as rapid load increases and decreases caused by large changes in RPM.

Figure 6(b) compares the predicted and measured CO emissions. CO emissions vary significantly compared with CO2 and NOX emissions. The IMO and EEA methods showed similar general trends but significantly underestimated the emissions, especially under high-load conditions. In contrast, the proposed model tends to overestimate CO emissions at high load, despite the hyperparameter being optimized. This suggests that the features selected by LASSO may not fully represent combustion processes under steady high-load conditions. Moreover, the relatively narrow yet highly fluctuating distribution of CO may have introduced instability in pattern learning. Additional factors such as sensor noise and limited sample converge at critical operating points could also have contributed to these deviations. Therefore, future work should consider preprocessing techniques (e.g., noise reduction) and incorporating combustion-specific variable to address these limitations. And multi-task learning that leverage the correlation among CO, CO2 and NOX emissions may improve robustness.

The proposed model accurately captured the emission trend, except in certain sections where a sharp emission spike was observed. These results demonstrate that the proposed model exhibits improved prediction performance.

Figure 6(c) shows the predicted and measured NOX emissions. The IMO bottom–up approach underestimated the emissions relative to the measured values, whereas the EEA method overestimated them. The EEA values more significantly deviated from the measured values than the IMO values, which can be attributed to the fact that the IMO method uses EFs that depend on the engine RPM, whereas the EEA method uses constant EFs. The proposed model, which predicts emissions based on actual engine operating data, accurately predicted the emission trends and achieved minimal deviation from the measured emissions.

Figure 7 shows the regression analysis results of the CO2, CO, and NOX emissions predicted using the proposed model with respect to the measured values. A residual plot is provided for each subplot to evaluate the validity of the regression model. The adjusted R² and slope for Figure 7(a) are 0.9935 and 0.9627, respectively, indicating that the predicted and measured CO2 emissions are in good agreement. The residuals are evenly distributed around zero, indicating no heteroscedasticity and supporting the validity of the regression model.

As shown in Figure 7(b), CO emissions had relatively larger residuals than the other pollutants. The adjusted R2 value was 0.6324, and the slope was 0.7660, indicating moderate prediction accuracy. The larger residuals can be attributed to the inherently high variations in the measured CO emission data. In future studies, more standardized CO data should be collected to retrain the model and improve its robustness. While CO showed comparatively larger residuals, this may also reflect feature insufficiency with respect to combustion-specific mechanisms. Prior studies indicate that injection timing and resulting in-cylinder pressure/heat-release phasing markedly influence incomplete oxidation products such as CO in compression-ignition engines4,36. Accordingly, future work will instrument combustion-specific variables (e.g., fuel injection timing, valve event timing) and retrain the model to better capture CO formation dynamics under diverse operating regimes.

As shown in Figure 7(c), although some data points deviate from the main trend, the adjusted R2 and slope are 0.9716 and 0.9623, respectively, indicating excellent prediction of NOX emissions by the proposed model using only the engine data. Except for a few outliers, the residuals were uniformly distributed, confirming that NOX emissions can be accurately estimated using only engine operation data.

Figure 8 shows the prediction and estimation error distributions of the proposed model and conventional bottom-up approaches (IMO and EEA) for each pollutant. In the histograms, the right- and left-skewed distributions indicate underestimation and overestimation, respectively. For all pollutants, the bottom–up approaches exhibited skewed error distributions, showing either underestimation or overestimation. In contrast, the proposed model exhibited approximately normal error distributions centered around zero, indicating better fit and accuracy.

Figure 8(a) presents the error distribution of CO2 emission prediction. The proposed TSF-Transformer model shows that most errors are concentrated near zero, indicating closer agreement with the actual emissions compared to the IMO and EEA methods. While the IMO and EEA approached consistently underestimate emissions with peaks around − 60 to − 80, the proposed model exhibits a higher frequency in the − 20 to 0 range, reflecting better reproduction for actual values under high-load conditions. This characteristic is particularly advantageous for maritime applications, as vessel spend most of their operation time in high-load sailing segments where accurate emission estimation is critical. Nevertheless, a residual bias toward underestimation remains in the distribution tails. Future works should focus on refining feature selection and applying advanced preprocessing techniques to reduce this bias. Moreover, separating stable segments from highly variable transient segments and analyzing feature sensitivity may future reduce variance in the error distribution and narrow the confidence interval of emission estimates.

For CO emissions (Figure 8(b)), despite the high variability of the measured data, the proposed model shows that errors are concentrated around zero. While the IMO and EEA approaches predominantly underestimate emissions, the proposed model exhibits a slight tendency toward overestimation, but with substantially smaller errors overall. Similar to CO2, underestimation is observed in the low-load region, whereas overestimation appears in the high-load region. To mitigate these issues, not only should feature selection be further refined, but combustion-specific variables such as fuel injection timing and pressure should also be incorporated. In addition, applying preprocessing techniques such as noise reduction—within the range that preserves the reliability of highly variable measured data—may enhance the model’s pattern recognition and learning effectiveness.

For NOX emissions (Figure 8(c)), the IMO method tends to underestimate while the EEA method tends to overestimate, whereas the proposed model demonstrate an error distribution centered closer to zero. The error range is also much narrower than those of the bottom-up approaches, highlighting the substantial improvement in prediction accuracy.

Figures 9(a)–(c) show the distribution of the CO2, CO, and NOX prediction errors with respect to the engine operating conditions, particularly the RPM and torque, which are key indicators of engine variability. The left and right plots in each subplot project the error distributions with respect to the RPM and torque, respectively. In all subplots, the shaded blue area represents the ± 5% error band relative to the maximum measured emission. The percentage of predictions within this band is also indicated.

As shown in Figure 9(a), 85.63% of the predictions fall within the ± 5% band, indicating consistently strong performance across most operating condition. Lager deviation appear mainly at low-RPM and torque segments, which are characterized by transient behavior and reduced engine stability. Because the test set is dominated by high-load operation, the improved accuracy in those segments makes the approach particularly suitable for estimating real-world CO2 emissions. Reducing the residual bias at low-load will likely require segment-specific rather than a single global model.

In contrast, CO remains the most challenging pollutant. Only 18.03% of prediction lie within ± 5%, and the error frequency increases toward high-RPM and torque where combustion changes rapidly. Two factors appear to limit performance. First, feature sufficiency: the LASSO-selected variables capture steady-state trends but under-represent combustion dynamics that strongly affect CO (e.g., fuel injection timing, pressure, air-fuel ratio indicators). Second, measurement scale and noise: although the PEMS was calibrated with a 4.74% CO span gas, voyage measurement were typically 0.01–0.03%. Operating far below the calibration span increase relative noise and makes short sparks hard to learn. To address these issues, we plan to (ⅰ) incorporate combustion-specific variables obtainable from the engine control/monitoring system; (ⅱ) adopt noise-aware preprocessing, e.g., stationary wavelet denoising to suppress isolated spikes while preserving step changes; (ⅲ) rebalance training with load-aware sampling so that low- and high-load segments are adequately represented; and (ⅳ) use robust/heteroscedastic objectives and a two branch architecture that learns separate experts for low- and high-load regimes with a simple load-based gate. In parallel, we will recalibrate the analyzer with lower-range span gas aligned to the observed concentration range to reduce instrument noise and improve label fidelity. These targeted steps are expected to improve CO robustness beyond what can be achieved by hyperparameter tuning alone.

For NOx (Figure 9(c)), 53.72% of the predictions are within the ± 5% range. Although the proposed model exhibited high performance under most operating conditions, larger deviations can occur under extremely high or low engine loads due to the nonlinear nature of NOX formation or insufficient training data for such edge cases.

The results confirm that the proposed data-driven approach substantially improve CO2 and NOx estimates under representative operating conditions, while CO accuracy remains limited by feature sufficiency and measurement scaling. Rather than attributing CO underperformance solely to “inherent variability”, we identify concrete, testable remedies—combustion-aware features, load-aware modeling, robust losses, wavelet-based denoising, and calibration range matching—that we will implement next to close the gap.

Table 9 presents the quantitative evaluation of the proposed model compared with conventional emission estimation methods. The comparison indicators are the coefficient of determination (R2), adjusted R2, RMSE, MAE, and MAPE.

For CO2, all methods, including the proposed model, exhibited high R2 values, ranging from 0.9935 to 0.9947. However, the proposed model exhibited significantly lower RMSE (43.52) and MAE (35.75) than the bottom–up approaches proposed by IMO and EEA (RMSE = 65.69 and MAE = 59.59). Compared with the conventional bottom–up approaches, the RMSE of the proposed model was improved by approximately 34%, and the MAE was improved by approximately 40%, indicating that the proposed model not only maintains a high correlation but also exhibits improved accuracy in absolute terms.

For CO, the proposed model exhibited an R2 of 0.6324 and an RMSE of only 0.94, which are lower than those of the IMO and EEA methods 0.7339 and 1.72, 1.78, respectively), indicating that the proposed model significantly outperforms the conventional approaches. In addition, the MAE of the proposed model (0.78) was significantly lower than that of the EEA method (1.61), indicating better generalizability of the proposed model despite significant variations in CO emissions. Compared with the EEA method, which showed a larger discrepancy than the IMO approach, the RMSE and MAE of the proposed model improved by approximately 45% and 47%, respectively.

For NOX, the proposed model exhibited an R2 of 0.9716, which is slightly lower than that of the conventional bottom–up approach method; however, its RMSE (1.60) is much lower than that of the IMO and EEA methods (2.71 and 5.08, respectively), indicating a more balanced performance. In addition, with an MAE of 1.27, the proposed model demonstrated more than a 40% improvement in RMSE and 48% improvement in MAE compared with the IMO method, which estimates emissions while reflecting engine characteristics. Overall, the proposed hybrid prediction model consistently exhibited higher predictive accuracy and lower error variance than the conventional bottom–up approaches for all pollutants.

To isolate the contribution of the hybrid architecture, a base learner (XGBoost) was compared against the stacked model under an identical protocol. For each pollutant, the same LASSO-selected features, identical train/test spilit, and tuning budgets were used. The meta-learner received the base predictions and their first differences, enabling it to reconcile sequence-level trends (from TSF-Transformer) with instantaneous nonlinear interactions (from XGBoost).

For CO2, relative to the XGBoost-only baseline, the stacked model reduced RMSE from 45.50 to 43.52 (\(\:\varDelta\:\)RMSE \(\:\approx\:\) 4.35%) and MAE from 38.29 to 35.75 (\(\:\varDelta\:\)MAE \(\:\approx\:\) 6.63%). Because R2 values were already saturated(\(\:\approx\:\)0.9935–0.9946), these absolute-error reductions are more indicative of practical gains, especially for inventory applications that penalize bias at higher loads.

In case of CO, the benefit of stacking was mixed. While the stacked model achieved slightly higher R2 than XGBoost-only, its RMSE was marginally worse (\(\:\approx\:\)+2% relative difference), with MAPE remaining similar. When target variance is dominated by unobserved combustion-specific factors, the marginal utility of combining learner becomes limited. In short, the hybrid model offers better calibration in some regimes but does no uniformly lower point error for CO given the current feature set.

For NOX, the stacked model improved over XGBoost-only, reducing RMSE from 1.70 to 1.60 (\(\:\varDelta\:\)RMSE \(\:\approx\:\) 5.9%) and MAE from 1.39 to 1.27 (\(\:\varDelta\:\)MAE \(\:\approx\:\) 8.6%), while maintaining competitive R2. These gains suggest that fusing short-horizon temporal cues (captured by TSF-Transformer) helps in regimes where formation chemistry interacts with engine load and temperature dynamics.

Stacking provided consistent, modest improvement for CO2 and NOx, where temporal structure and nonlinear interactions are complementary. For CO, the hybrid did not dominate the best single learner, indicating diminishing returns under heavy noise/omission (e.g., lack of fuel injection timing).

Although this study was validated on a single diesel engine vessel equipped with a CPP, the proposed hybrid framework (TSF-Transformer + XGBoost) was designed on the basis of time-series engine data acquired from the AMS rather than fuel-specific constants, suggesting its potential applicability to other vessel types. The engine data used in this work were collected under controlled condition together with emission measurements (HORIBA OBS-ONE-GS12) and are real time capable (0.1 Hz, 174 samples), thereby providing a realistic operational envelope for assessing scalability. With the recent introduction of alternative fuels in maritime sector (e.g., LNG, methanol, ammonia), applying this framework to new propulsion systems would require additional analysis of emission characteristics arising from combustion and re-training of the base framework. Because the proposed model learns the interactions between engine operating states and emission outputs rather than relying on fixed factor, it is expected to be sufficiently extensible. Furthermore, aside from CPP-affected segment, the operating relationship among RPM, load, and speed follows the propeller law, which was also observed in this study. SHAP-based sensitivity analysis indicated that the prediction results were not substantially influenced by pitch variations, thereby supporting the feasibility of extending the framework to vessels equipped with FPP.",https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-025-24393-x/MediaObjects/41598_2025_24393_Fig1_HTML.png,N,,2025-11-18 12:58:52.187737

As disclosed in a social media post, the 40-meter-long newbuildings were delivered to the Bermudan government ahead of schedule. The vessels were designed by Australia’s One2Three Naval Architects.

The handover of the units, which will be able to carry around 550 passengers, marks the first collaboration between Bermuda and the Singaporean vessel construction player, according to officials from Strategic Marine. The parties reportedly shook hands on this project around two years ago.

The environmentally friendly catamarans, which are now ready for deployment in Bermudan waters, are described as having been built with features that would ensure operational efficiency as well as sustainable ferry services.

To be specific, as Strategic Marine has elaborated, the ferries were engineered to meet Bermuda’s current and future operational requirements, with projections that they could lead to a carbon dioxide (CO2) emission reduction level of at least 25%, particularly when compared to the already deployed units on a passenger-mile basis.

Reflecting on this development, Owen Darrell, JP, MP, Bermuda’s Minister of Tourism and Transport, Culture & Sport, remarked that the eco-conscious newbuilds could play a ‘significant’ role in supporting the country’s environmental goals and, at the same time, foster “long-term savings for the taxpayer”.

It is worth noting that Strategic Marine had been given the technical acceptance for the aluminium caramaran duo back in September this year, which marked the first step before the vessels’ handover and deployment.

Despite the trials and tribulations concerning global environmental regulations, particularly the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) Net Zero Framework, which strives for climate neutrality by (or around 2050), Bermuda has kept pace with its sustainability targets.
