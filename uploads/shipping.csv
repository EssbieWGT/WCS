Speaking during a panel debate at Travel Weekly’s Sustainability Summit, Airlines UK chief executive Tim Alderslade was confident the Revenue Certainty Mechanism (RSM) – a UK government scheme to support investment in the production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) – would come into law as planned by the end of 2026.
She added: “I’m not just talking about airlines here, I’m talking about the fuel suppliers, so the oil and gas companies, which are dragging their heels on producing sustainable aviation fuel.
The airline manufacturers, so Boeing and Airbus, are also dragging their heels on developing new aircraft.
“Everybody’s dragging their heels.","Aviation and cruise sustainability experts are hopeful of progress within the sectors next year but admit delays and increased emissions are also likely.

Progress would rely on “how quickly they can enrol contracts, depending upon the projects that come forward”, he said, but insisted: “There will be more momentum around RCM this time next year, and I think we’ll be much more developed in terms of our thinking and government’s thinking as well as the greenhouse gas removals market.”

Aviation Environment Federation policy manager Celeste Hicks agreed: “We’re not sure whether that means contracts being awarded at the end of next year, but that’s the idea. That will give us an indication of whether we’re going to hit the 2030 SAF targets.”

But she said she also expected to see “delay and increased international aviation emissions” over the next 12 months, and accused the industry as a whole of “dragging its heels” on the production of sustainable aviation fuel.

She added: “I’m not just talking about airlines here, I’m talking about the fuel suppliers, so the oil and gas companies, which are dragging their heels on producing sustainable aviation fuel. The airline manufacturers, so Boeing and Airbus, are also dragging their heels on developing new aircraft.

“Everybody’s dragging their heels. It’s easy for everybody to blame each other, but we don’t see the progress.”

Carnival UK vice-president sustainability and strategy Sophie Portlock was hopeful of progress in 2026 towards an International Maritime Organisation (IMO) deal to reduce carbon emissions globally to reach net zero by 2050, despite talks falling apart earlier this year.

Referring to a one year delay to a vote on adopting a global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions pricing mechanism for international shipping, she said: “It will be interesting to see what happens as a result of the IMO discussions around the net zero framework.”

She stressed the deal had not been “discarded”, adding: “It’s just been delayed by a year. That vote is now due to take place in October next year, and over the coming 12 months, there is work that is going to be done to look at some of these technical challenges and how we overcome some of those within that framework.”

While cruise only makes up 2% of the international shipping industry, ensuring alignment in the move to alternative fuels was “key” to provide confidence and clarity in the market, she stressed.

Carnival Corporation had already seen an 11% reduction in its total greenhouse gasses since a peak in 2011 following investment in energy efficiency measures and new technology, despite a 38% capacity increase over the same period of time, she said.

“That shows how these initiatives and these developments are leading to a reduction in our total carbon footprint,” she said, adding Carnival Corporation had 11 ships operating on liquefied natural gas (LNG), with 18 due to have LNG by 2033, covering around a third of total passenger capacity.

She added more than 70% of the group’s fleet had shore power capability but said the challenge in Europe was the number of available ports.

“There are about 16 ports that have shore power capability that can support cruise ships of our size,” she said, but noted: “We are expecting to see a further seven ports of a shore power capability next year. So it is increasing.”",https://dcxnozgahgy2a.cloudfront.net/AcuCustom/Sitename/DAM/384/Tim_Alderslade_sustainability_summit1_Main.webp,N,,2025-12-08 06:56:11.483555

If the vessel experienced more favourable wind conditions, the savings could be higher.
GCMD said the findings matter as the analysis captures the full distribution of observed power savings linked to wind conditions rather than relying on a single aggregated value.
The system also integrates intelligent sensing and automatic control to adjust rotor operation based on real-time wind conditions, maximizing wind propulsion efficiency, while maintaining safety.
“The stage is set for the next phase of the maritime energy transition,” said Knut Ørbeck-Nilssen, CEO of DNV Maritime.","The Global Centre for Maritime Decarbonisation (GCMD) on Friday (5 December) said it implemented a Wind Assisted Propulsion Systems (WAPS) performance monitoring method with Singapore-based Eastern Pacific Shipping Pte Ltd (EPS) to measure suction sails’ performance on tanker Pacific Sentinel.

GCMD said WAPS are gaining traction as an important decarbonisation lever, but uptake is still far below what is needed to meet regulatory targets.

A major barrier is its inherently variable fuel savings, which depend on operational and environmental factors such as routing and weather conditions. This is compounded by the lack of a standardised method to accurately quantify WAPS performance during real-world operations.

To address this, GCMD and EPS implemented the study and published their joint report titled Quantifying energy savings from wind-assisted propulsion systems (WAPS): A case study on the Pacific Sentinel.

The Pacific Sentinel sampled predominantly near-headwind conditions during this four-month testing period. Accordingly, the mean instantaneous power savings derived from valid on-off tests during this period was 7.2%, with a 95% confidence interval between 6.2% and 8.2%. If the vessel experienced more favourable wind conditions, the savings could be higher.

Instantaneous savings reached as high as 28.1% when the apparent wind angle was 47° and wind speed was 15.3 m/s. There were instances where near-headwind conditions resulted in negative power savings as low as -14.0%. Both are statistically rare events given the range of wind conditions experienced in this particular testing period, at three standard deviations from the mean of instantaneous power savings derived during this testing period.

Over four months of testing, they observed a range of power savings across different wind conditions:

Mean instantaneous power savings: 7.2% (95% confidence interval of 6.2–8.2%)

We also observed peak savings of up to 28.1% and negative savings of –14.0%, though both were statistically rare.

GCMD said the findings matter as the analysis captures the full distribution of observed power savings linked to wind conditions rather than relying on a single aggregated value.

“This provides a more realistic and confidence-based understanding of suction sail performance on the Pacific Sentinel,” it added.

GCMD added that the pilot shows how much, and under what conditions, WAPS deliver savings. As GCMD runs more pilots, larger datasets will enable modelling and fuel savings predictions across diverse operating conditions.

“With quantified and verifiable savings, a pay-as-you-save repayment mechanism becomes viable, linking repayments directly to measured performance,” it added.

“This underpins our recently launched Fund for Energy Efficiency Technologies (FEET) fund, which decouples retrofit financing from vessel mortgages by offering unsecured leases.”

Classification society DNV on Wednesday (3 December) said it has granted a Type Approval Design Certificate (TADC) to CSSC Shanghai Marine Energy Saving Technology Co., Ltd. (CMES-Tech) for its new 5m × 35m Tilting Type Wind Assisted Rotor System.

This is the first domestically developed rotor sail system in China to achieve this recognition under DNV’s WAPS rules (ST-0511).

With this certification, the classification society said the system is confirmed ready for installation on DNV classed commercial vessels and marks a major milestone for China’s green-shipping technology industry.

As shipping faces mounting pressure from fuel costs and emissions regulations, the demand for reliable and efficient wind-assisted propulsion systems is rising globally. Recent years have seen a growing number of WAPS solutions certified by DNV, including fixed or tiltable rotor, wingsail, and suction sail systems from providers around the world.

The CMES-Tech tiltable rotor system features a retractable and adjustable design, enabling the rotor to adapt to varying draft and clearance conditions, and retract during cargo operations to avoid interference with deck/hatch operations or port infrastructure. The system also integrates intelligent sensing and automatic control to adjust rotor operation based on real-time wind conditions, maximizing wind propulsion efficiency, while maintaining safety.

Dr. Huang Guofu, General Manager of CMES-Tech, said: “Receiving the DNV TADC is a landmark for China’s green-shipping industry and a strong validation of our design’s maturity, structural integrity and operational practicality. It demonstrates that our 5 m × 35 m tilting rotor design meets the highest classification and validates our commitment to driving maritime efficiency. We look forward to working with DNV as we continue to innovate and deliver solutions that can deliver economic and environmental value to shipowners worldwide.”

As part of the TADC process, DNV’s classification experts reviewed all mechanical, structural, and electrical design documentation, and assessed the system’s suitability for shipboard application under realistic operational and environmental conditions. The review confirmed that the design of the CMES-Tech system meets the requirements of DNV’s WAPS technical standard (ST-0511).

Mr. Chen Keng, DNV Vice President and Area Manager China South, said: “With increasing demand for energy-efficient and emission-reduction solutions, WAPS technologies offer immediate, tangible benefits to shipowners.

“The awarding of this TADC to CMES-Tech means we add another option to the growing portfolio of WAPS systems that have been assessed to the industry’s leading rule set, building further confidence in their readiness for real-world use. We congratulate CMES-Tech on this achievement, which underscores our strong collaboration on enabling the broader deployment new energy enhancing technologies.”

The rotor sail prototype has also successfully passed a rigorous 120% overload structural test, demonstrating its robustness under extreme load conditions. Looking ahead, CMES-Tech will proceed with detailed installation planning and sea-trials to validate the in-service performance of the new system.

U-Ming Marine Transport Corporation (U-Ming) and wind propulsion technology provider Anemoi Marine Technologies Ltd. (Anemoi) on Wednesday (1 October) announced the successful completion of the Rotor Sail installation on U-Ming’s Grand Pioneer, a 325,000 DWT Very Large Ore Carrier (VLOC).

U-Ming is the first Taiwanese shipowner to adopt Rotor Sails, marking a major milestone in the company’s decarbonisation strategy.

The four 35m tall, 5m diameter folding (tilting) Rotor Sails were delivered fully assembled and dynamically balanced from Anemoi’s production base on the Yangtze River and transported by barge to COSCO Zhoushan shipyard.

In a streamlined plug-and-play process unique to Anemoi, the sails were lifted directly onto the deck and secured in place. This method significantly reduces the shipyard’s scope of work and keeps installation time short.

For this installation, it took only 1.5 days to lift and fix the Rotor Sails in position onboard, with a further five days for commissioning and testing all four Rotor Sails and folding systems once the shipyard had completed their works during the vessel’s scheduled dry-dock in September 2025.

Anemoi’s specialist team were present throughout the process overseeing the installation and will sail on the vessel’s maiden voyage from Zhoushan to Singapore, with the Rotor Sails deployed and operational. This is to ensure crew training and operational handover will be completed smoothly, equipping U-Ming’s seafarers with the skills and confidence to operate the technology from day one.

Following completion of the installation, Grand Pioneer will resume deep-sea service between Brazil and China under a long-term charter with Brazilian mining company Vale. The vessel is projected to achieve annual marine fuel and emissions reductions of approximately 10–12% on average.

New insights from DNV’s Maritime Forecast to 2050, published on Thursday (11 September) showed that shipping’s energy transition is entering a new phase: One defined by strategic investment, accelerating fleet readiness, and emerging regulatory developments.

With the IMO’s Net-Zero Framework (NZF) approved but pending adoption in October, and the number of alternative-fuel-capable vessels in operation set to almost double by 2028, shipowners are shifting from preparation to action.

By 2030, the alternative-fuelled fleet will be able to burn up to 50 million tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe) of low-greenhouse gas (GHG) fuels annually, double the estimated volume needed to meet the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) 2030 emissions target. Yet today, actual consumption of low-GHG fuels remains at just 1 Mtoe.

This widening gap between capacity and use highlights both the scale of industry commitment and the urgent need for fuel producers and infrastructure developers to accelerate supply to match the fleet’s readiness.

“The stage is set for the next phase of the maritime energy transition,” said Knut Ørbeck-Nilssen, CEO of DNV Maritime.

“The IMO’s Net-Zero Framework has imperfections and greater clarity is urgently needed around how the collected money will be spent. It is already influencing investment decisions, operational choices and fuel strategies across the industry. Shipowners will adjust their strategic priorities pending the October IMO meeting, which will lay the foundation for the years and decades ahead.”

The ninth edition of DNV’s Maritime Forecast to 2050 provides a comprehensive analysis of the fuels, technologies, and regulations shaping the future of shipping, assisting decision-makers in navigating the next phase of the energy transition.

The report outlines several solutions that could help bridge the gap between fleet readiness and fuel availability:

Leveraging existing fuel infrastructure for low-GHG fuels, like biodiesel and bio-LNG, combined with the adoption of flexible chains of custody models can significantly ease access to these fuels, incentivizing and accelerating both production and uptake.

Energy-efficiency measures on newbuilds are increasingly deployed, reducing emissions immediately without requiring new infrastructure or supply-chain development.

Onboard carbon capture (OCC) is gaining traction, particularly for large vessels with available onboard space. Modelling from the report shows that equipping 20 major ports with CO2 offloading infrastructure could enable the removal of up to 75 million tonnes of captured CO2 annually, potentially offsetting the need for 25 Mtoe of low-GHG fuels, as much as is needed to reach the IMO’s 2030 base target

2025 could be a breakthrough year for maritime wind energy. Wind-assisted propulsion systems (WAPS) are gaining broader commercial adoption, with claims of 5-20% reduction in fuel use for certain ships, according to vessel owners, operators and technology makers.

“The industry has made real technical progress in recent years,” said Eirik Ovrum, Lead Author of the report.

“But these solutions are still operating in silos. To deliver impact, they need to be integrated into fleet strategies, supported by infrastructure, and recognized in compliance frameworks. That’s where the next phase of work must focus.”

This year’s Maritime Forecast to 2050 report urges stakeholders to prepare early and evaluate all cost-effective pathways, recognizing that compliance strategies will vary by vessel type, operational profile, and regulatory exposure.

Moller – Maersk (Maersk) on Friday (6 December) said it is continuing to explore options to diversify its low-emission fuel portfolio by testing ethanol in a dual-fuel methanol engine.

Building on a successful initial trial, the company will now blend 50% ethanol with 50% methanol in a test onboard the vessel Laura Maersk.

The first trial, conducted in October and November, involved a 10% ethanol / 90% e-methanol blend and confirmed that ethanol can be safely and effectively integrated into the fuel mix. The test underscores the potential to create greater optionality for Maersk’s dual-fuel methanol fleet, essentially enabling dual fuel alcohol vessels.

Laura Maersk, the world’s first dual-fuel container vessel operating on methanol, was designed for methanol as the alternative fuel. Because ethanol and methanol are both alcohols, they share similar properties. The initial trial tested whether an E10 blend would ignite and burn as efficiently as pure methanol while maintaining comparable lubricity and corrosiveness.

The results confirm that ethanol can be blended with methanol without compromising engine performance, paving the way for higher ethanol blends. Beyond the upcoming E50 test, Maersk plans to conduct a trial using 100% ethanol.

Emma Mazhari, Head of Energy Markets at Maersk, said: “Ethanol has a proven track record with an established market and existing infrastructure and offers an additional pathway for decarbonisation.

“By gradually increasing ethanol content, we gain valuable insights into engine performance and combustion impacts, informing fuel sourcing potential.”

US shipbuilder Conrad Shipyard and South Korean shipbuilder Samsung Heavy Industries (SHI) on Thursday (4 November) announced the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) that formalises a collaborative framework to jointly explore opportunities in the rapidly expanding US LNG bunkering market.

Under the M0U, Conrad and SHI will work together to evaluate and pursue technical, commercial, and market-based initiatives that support the design, construction, and deployment of LNG bunkering vessels tailored for U.S. regulatory and operational requirements.

The MoU is intended to combine SHI’s global expertise in advanced LNG technologies with Conrad’s proven LNG shipbuilding capabilities and domestic market access.

A representative of SHI stated, “Through this collaboration, we expect to enter the U.S. LNG bunkering market while also contributing to the revitalisation of the U.S. shipbuilding industry.”

“We are honoured to collaborate with Samsung Heavy Industries,” said Johnny Conrad, Executive Chairman, Conrad Shipyard. “This MoU reflects Conrad’s focus on driving innovation in the U.S. maritime sector and positions both organisations to develop advanced LNG bunkering vessels tailored to meet market demand.”

Conrad’s extensive experience navigating regulatory requirements associated with LNG bunkering vessel design, engineering, and construction combined with SHI’s art LNG technology will greatly enhance the US LNG market.

Classification society DNV’s latest white paper recently highlighted that methanol-fuelled engines and technical systems have reached high readiness levels, and that existing global production sites, storage facilities, and a growing bunker fleet are providing a strong platform for wider adoption.

In addition, industry stakeholders are already investing in the fuel, with China accounting for 43 percent of planned global low-GHG methanol production capacity. But, as with all alternative fuels, methanol’s future role will depend on a combination of regulatory, economic, and operational factors.

Knut Ørbeck-Nilssen, CEO Maritime at DNV, said: “As the maritime industry explores pathways to a lower-carbon future, it is important to consider a range of practical and scalable solutions. There is no one-size-fits-all answer, and different shipping segments and geographies will require different approaches.

“Methanol is one option that draws on established technologies and infrastructure, and it is encouraging to see the industry’s growing interest in a variety of alternative fuels.”

Methanol can offer environmental benefits. It is sulfur-free, produces negligible soot, and emits significantly less NOx than fuel oil. The report highlights that certain bio- and e-methanol pathways can deliver very low or even negative lifecycle emissions, and that methanol’s compatibility with existing port infrastructure and the availability of interim bunkering solutions may also reduce complexity and cost for shipowners.

However, the report notes that cost and availability remain significant barriers, as is the case for many alternative fuels. Bio-methanol prices in 2025 average around USD 2,500 per tonne MGOe, roughly three times the cost of marine gas oil, while global production stands at just 2.2 million tonnes, far below the potential demand of up to 60 million tonnes by 2040. The report models four demand scenarios, showing that regulatory frameworks such as the IMO’s Net Zero Framework and FuelEU Maritime could be decisive in scaling up adoption.

Marius Leisner, Senior Principal Consultant in DNV, added: “From a technical perspective, methanol-fuelled engines have demonstrated high reliability, with industry data indicating that modern dual-fuel engine designs have accumulated more than 600,000 operating hours on methanol. Retrofit feasibility is well established, and the use of conventional bunkering systems, unlike cryogenic fuels, means ports can adapt quickly and cost-effectively.

DNV added methanol also provides fuel flexibility: dual-fuel engines can operate on methanol, biodiesel, or conventional fuels, and, with minor modifications, on ethanol.

Knut Ørbeck-Nilssen, CEO Maritime at DNV, said: “As the maritime industry explores pathways to a lower-carbon future, it is important to consider a range of practical and scalable solutions. There is no one-size-fits-all answer, and different shipping segments and geographies will require different approaches.

“Methanol is one option that draws on established technologies and infrastructure, and it is encouraging to see the industry’s growing interest in a variety of alternative fuels.”

Methanol can offer environmental benefits. It is sulfur-free, produces negligible soot, and emits significantly less NOx than fuel oil. The report highlights that certain bio- and e-methanol pathways can deliver very low or even negative lifecycle emissions, and that methanol’s compatibility with existing port infrastructure and the availability of interim bunkering solutions may also reduce complexity and cost for shipowners.

However, the report notes that cost and availability remain significant barriers, as is the case for many alternative fuels. Bio-methanol prices in 2025 average around USD 2,500 per tonne MGOe, roughly three times the cost of marine gas oil, while global production stands at just 2.2 million tonnes, far below the potential demand of up to 60 million tonnes by 2040. The report models four demand scenarios, showing that regulatory frameworks such as the IMO’s Net Zero Framework and FuelEU Maritime could be decisive in scaling up adoption.

Marius Leisner, Senior Principal Consultant in DNV, added: “From a technical perspective, methanol-fuelled engines have demonstrated high reliability, with industry data indicating that modern dual-fuel engine designs have accumulated more than 600,000 operating hours on methanol. Retrofit feasibility is well established, and the use of conventional bunkering systems, unlike cryogenic fuels, means ports can adapt quickly and cost-effectively.

DNV added methanol also provides fuel flexibility: dual-fuel engines can operate on methanol, biodiesel, or conventional fuels, and, with minor modifications, on ethanol.

A.P. Moller – Maersk (Maersk) on Friday (6 December) said it is continuing to explore options to diversify its low-emission fuel portfolio by testing ethanol in a dual-fuel methanol engine.

Building on a successful initial trial, the company will now blend 50% ethanol with 50% methanol in a test onboard the vessel Laura Maersk.

The first trial, conducted in October and November, involved a 10% ethanol / 90% e-methanol blend and confirmed that ethanol can be safely and effectively integrated into the fuel mix. The test underscores the potential to create greater optionality for Maersk’s dual-fuel methanol fleet, essentially enabling dual fuel alcohol vessels.

Laura Maersk, the world’s first dual-fuel container vessel operating on methanol, was designed for methanol as the alternative fuel. Because ethanol and methanol are both alcohols, they share similar properties. The initial trial tested whether an E10 blend would ignite and burn as efficiently as pure methanol while maintaining comparable lubricity and corrosiveness.

The results confirm that ethanol can be blended with methanol without compromising engine performance, paving the way for higher ethanol blends. Beyond the upcoming E50 test, Maersk plans to conduct a trial using 100% ethanol.

Emma Mazhari, Head of Energy Markets at Maersk, said: “Ethanol has a proven track record with an established market and existing infrastructure and offers an additional pathway for decarbonisation.

“By gradually increasing ethanol content, we gain valuable insights into engine performance and combustion impacts, informing fuel sourcing potential.”

China Marine Bunker (PetroChina) (Chimbusco), in collaboration with Shenzhen Port Group and COSCO Shipping Lines, on Wednesday (3 December) successfully completed the first-ever green methanol bunkering operation in the Greater Bay Area.

Chimbusco successfully bunkered methanol dual-fuel container vessel COSCO Shipping Carnation with domestically produced green methanol fuel at Yantian Port in Shenzhen.

“The successful implementation of this green methanol bunkering not only fills a gap in relevant services within the region but also underscores Shenzhen Port’s infrastructure support and comprehensive service capabilities in supplying new types of clean energy as an international hub port. It holds significant demonstration and leading importance for the industry’s green upgrading,” the company said.

“This move also accumulates valuable experience for the subsequent large-scale and regular operation of green methanol bunkering services in the Greater Bay Area, and will strongly promote green and sustainable development in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area.”

COSCO Shipping Carnation is the sister vessel of China’s first methanol dual-fuel container ship, COSCO Shipping Yangpu. It can flexibly utilise green methanol or traditional fuel, significantly reducing carbon emissions and pollutant emissions during operation.

Shenzhen Chimbusco Ship Bunker Co Ltd and Shenzhen Port Energy Development Co Ltd will jointly advance the construction of a green marine bunkering system to assist the shipping industry in its low-carbon transformation.

Vietnamese shipowner Asia Pacific Shipping (ASP) on Tuesday (2 December) said it has taken delivery of Vietnam’s first methanol dual-fuel MR2 oil/chemical tanker, ASP Rainbow, at Guangzhou Shipyard International (GSI), a subsidiary of China State Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC).

The milestone was celebrated with the official delivery of 49,500-dwt ASP Rainbow and the joint naming ceremony for the tanker and its sister vessel, ASP Sunshine, on 20 November.

“The two vessels, named ASP Rainbow and ASP Sunshine, are not only the first in a series of new builds ordered by ASP but are also the first commercial vessels in Vietnam to utilise dual-fuel technology,” the company said.

“Putting these new tankers into operation, which are capable of running on both traditional fuel and methanol, enables ASP to become the pioneer in Vietnam to own a fleet capable of using clean fuel.

“This technology not only offers maximum operational flexibility but also makes the vessels significantly friendlier to the environment.”

ASP added the move holds important strategic significance, particularly in the context of increasingly tightening international maritime environmental regulations, which have a direct impact on the adoption of methanol as an alternative fuel.

“Investing in methanol dual-fuel technology helps ASP overcome future environmental challenges while maintaining a competitive advantage in global business operations,” ASP added.

This is the first delivery in the company’s plan to build a series of methanol-powered MR2 vessels that ASP signed with GSI in 2024.

The research, published in Environmental Science: Atmospheres, used aircraft and ground-based instruments to measure sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides emitted by ships in the North-East Atlantic and European coastal waters between 2019 and 2023.

The team found that the average sulphur content in ship fuel dropped nearly tenfold in open ocean areas following the International Maritime Organization’s 2020 regulation, which capped sulphur content in marine fuel at 0.5%.

Before the change, many ships exceeded the previous 3.5% limit. After 2020, only a small number of ships were found to breach the new standard.

In European sulphur Emission Control Areas (SECAs), such as the English Channel and the Port of Tyne, sulphur levels were even lower – well below the stricter 0.1% limit. Interestingly, ports outside these zones, like Valencia in Spain, also showed low sulphur levels, likely due to EU rules requiring cleaner fuel when ships are docked for extended periods.

This is the first study to use aircraft-based measurements and predictions from the Ship Traffic Emission Assessment Model (STEAM3) to assess ship emissions outside of sulphur control zones since the 2020 regulation came into effect. The findings support the widely held view that ships now emit around seven times less sulphur than before the rule change – an important step toward cleaner air and healthier coastal environments.

The Global Centre for Maritime Decarbonisation (GCMD) on Friday (5 December) said it implemented a Wind Assisted Propulsion Systems (WAPS) performance monitoring method with Singapore-based Eastern Pacific Shipping Pte Ltd (EPS) to measure suction sails’ performance on tanker Pacific Sentinel.

GCMD said WAPS are gaining traction as an important decarbonisation lever, but uptake is still far below what is needed to meet regulatory targets.

A major barrier is its inherently variable fuel savings, which depend on operational and environmental factors such as routing and weather conditions. This is compounded by the lack of a standardised method to accurately quantify WAPS performance during real-world operations.

To address this, GCMD and EPS implemented the study and published their joint report titled Quantifying energy savings from wind-assisted propulsion systems (WAPS): A case study on the Pacific Sentinel.

The Pacific Sentinel sampled predominantly near-headwind conditions during this four-month testing period. Accordingly, the mean instantaneous power savings derived from valid on-off tests during this period was 7.2%, with a 95% confidence interval between 6.2% and 8.2%. If the vessel experienced more favourable wind conditions, the savings could be higher.

Instantaneous savings reached as high as 28.1% when the apparent wind angle was 47° and wind speed was 15.3 m/s. There were instances where near-headwind conditions resulted in negative power savings as low as -14.0%. Both are statistically rare events given the range of wind conditions experienced in this particular testing period, at three standard deviations from the mean of instantaneous power savings derived during this testing period.

Over four months of testing, they observed a range of power savings across different wind conditions:

Mean instantaneous power savings: 7.2% (95% confidence interval of 6.2–8.2%)

We also observed peak savings of up to 28.1% and negative savings of –14.0%, though both were statistically rare.

GCMD said the findings matter as the analysis captures the full distribution of observed power savings linked to wind conditions rather than relying on a single aggregated value.

“This provides a more realistic and confidence-based understanding of suction sail performance on the Pacific Sentinel,” it added.

GCMD added that the pilot shows how much, and under what conditions, WAPS deliver savings. As GCMD runs more pilots, larger datasets will enable modelling and fuel savings predictions across diverse operating conditions.

“With quantified and verifiable savings, a pay-as-you-save repayment mechanism becomes viable, linking repayments directly to measured performance,” it added.

“This underpins our recently launched Fund for Energy Efficiency Technologies (FEET) fund, which decouples retrofit financing from vessel mortgages by offering unsecured leases.”

He said introducing LNG into daily operations not only lowers emissions, but also gives the company “hands-on experience with the technologies that will shape the future of European maritime transport, confirming our commitment to increasingly sustainable and competitive shipping”.

Mr Catani acknowledged constraints on the wider uptake of bioLNG and said GNV is working to make the use of bioLNG a structural solution for its operations, but current fuel availability remains limited and requires “significant investments, as well as the development of a supply chain capable of ensuring stable, large-scale provision”.

He added costs are still high, the quantity available on the market does not yet meet growing demand and it is “a complex journey that requires the commitment and collaboration of all stakeholders in the sector”.

The six-hour bunkering operation was conducted in line with current safety regulations and international guidelines, with 500 m3 of bioLNG transferred to GNV Virgo, which the companies said is enough to fuel the vessel’s return voyage to Palermo.

Van Oord has completed the transport and installation of all 21 monopiles at Iberdrola’s Windanker offshore wind farm, a key milestone in the construction of the project. This achievement involved the largest monopiles Van Oord has ever installed, made possible by earlier upgrades to its heavy lift installation vessel Svanen, which is now equipped to manage next-generation offshore wind monopile foundations.

Van Oord’s scope of work included loading the monopiles at the fabrication site in Spain and transporting them to the Port of Rønne, Denmark. Manufactured by a joint venture between Navantia and Windar, the monopiles rank among the largest ever installed by Van Oord, with a diameter of 10 metres, lengths of 70.6 to 86.6 metres, and weights of up to 2,145 tonnes. From the port, they were lifted using MTC cranes and towed by two tugs to the installation vessel Svanen.

Protecting marine life through noise mitigation

Van Oord used specialised techniques to protect marine life from harmful noise levels during monopile installation. Bubble screens created a curtain of air bubbles around the work area to absorb and reduce sound waves, while a Hydro Sound Damper net provided extra noise reduction.

Sustainable measures for offshore installation

In line with Van Oord’s ambition to achieve net-zero emissions, renewable fuel was used to power the compressors for the bubble screens, cutting greenhouse gas emissions for this activity by up to 86%. This sustainability initiative was made possible through a joint effort with Iberdrola, Van Oord and Hydrotechnik Offshore (HTO), who shared the costs of using renewable fuel.

Building on this effort, in partnership with Skyports Drone Services, long-range drone technology was deployed as part of an innovative pilot project. The goal was to transport items from the shore to the offshore installation site, reducing reliance on supply vessels and the project’s environmental footprint. Van Oord is now the first marine contractor to perform Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) drone flights to vessels in a wind farm under construction.

‘Completing the transport and installation of all monopiles at the Windanker offshore wind farm marks an important milestone for the project. This achievement reflects the dedication and expertise of our teams, the excellent collaboration with our client Iberdrola, and the outstanding performance of the Svanen. We are proud to have installed our largest and heaviest monopile to date, which demonstrates our commitment to enhancing the energy transition and delivering sustainable solutions for the future.’

Joost van Wiechen, Project Manager at Van Oord

Adding 315 MW to Iberdrola’s Baltic Hub

Located in the German Baltic Sea, around 45 kilometres northeast of the island of Rügen, Windanker will add 315 megawatts of capacity to Iberdrola’s Baltic Hub, supplying enough renewable energy to power approximately 315,000 households.

Upcoming phases: transition pieces and inter-array cables

Van Oord’s remaining scope will be delivered in two phases. The first involves transporting and installing 21 transition pieces, scheduled for completion by December 2025. This will be followed in the first quarter of 2026 by the installation of the inter-array cables, part of Van Oord’s EPCI scope, which involves interconnecting the turbines and offshore substation and supporting energy transmission throughout the wind farm.

Blue Energy serves as the Norway office of bunker supplier Global Energy Supply, and operates as a dedicated unit focused on delivering environmental and regulatory-driven energy solutions for their partners.

Uncertainty over the proliferation of GHG emissions regulations for shipping is driving demand for its services, Trine Braathen, the company's director of environmental trading, said in an interview with Ship & Bunker.

Braathen noted the information she provided is intended for industry insights only and should not be considered as specific guidance for purchasing or selling allowances. Specific cases may differ and should be evaluated individually, and Blue Energy assumes no responsibility for any decisions made based on this information.

""What we're seeing, and have seen for a few years, is that the regulatory landscape is changing on both mandatory and voluntary developments,"" Braathen said.

""There are lots of things happening at the EU level, national levels and also, of course, the IMO level concerning the shipping segment.

""There's no doubt that the green initiatives and the green regulatory changes are in super-focus in the industry at the moment, because of course this represents something new; it represents complexity, and it represents something most of the shipping companies are not really fully aware of or understand fully, and it's definitely not their core competence.

""Our role, and why we see it as a business opportunity, is precisely because of this uncertainty.

""It's where we can use our expertise and knowledge, and share that with our customers and stakeholders.""

GHG Services

The EUA market is Blue Energy's primary focus for shipping at present.

But the company is also preparing to offer biofuels, both B100 and blended products.

Compliance with the FuelEU Maritime regulation may also become part of its business in time, Braathen said.

""Of course, FuelEU Maritime is definitely something that we will investigate quite a bit in December to see what our role is in the market, where can we actually provide our expertise and guidance,"" she said.

""As a company, we will focus on being a supplier, so we would not necessarily go on the emission side into reporting, for example, or verification.""

The firm is also starting to see interest from shipping companies in UK Allowance procurement for compliance with the UK Emissions Trading Scheme. Domestic shipping will be added to the UK ETS next year, and international shipping from 2028.

EUA Procurement Strategy

The firm has seen a variety of approaches to EUA procurement for EU-ETS compliance in its work with shipping companies.

""What we're seeing at the moment is lots of different types of procurement strategies,"" Braathen said.

""The most common one is just to buy per voyage; I think at least for the mid-size and bigger fleets, that's definitely the norm.

""But for the smaller companies, it's quite interesting, they don't have the liquidity or the budget and so forth, and they are just bundling the volume and buying it as late as possible.""

A more complex approach may bear dividends, for those willing to become more deeply involved in these markets.

""There's room for improvement for these types of strategies, but it all depends on risk preference and risk exposure,"" Braathen said.

""It depends on, would you allow to only buy these allowances, or would you allow to also sell them.

""And if you buy them, bundling some volume ... and suddenly the market price dropped by 15%, in your governance and policy are you then stuck with that position, or are you allowing it to be sold back to the market and then buy it back at a lower price?

""And of course, it comes down to liquidity in the company.

""Do they actually have the liquidity to hedge for future years and so forth? It depends a bit on which type of company, but we definitely see discussions which are much more advanced than a year ago.""

EUA Savings

Braathen points to volatility in the EUA price this year as evidence of the potential savings to be made by altering strategy.

""Let's look at an example I gave to a customer about this a few days ago, where we just looked at prices during the autumn of this year,"" she said.

""Imagine if you were buying volume on, let's say, August 1, at EUR 71/mtCO2e.

""Let's say, to simplify it, you had a volume of 100,000 mtCO2e that you needed to buy, and then at 71 you buy all the volume because you believe that's a good price.

""Then you have another company waiting and waiting, and they decide to buy volume on November 1 instead, and they buy at EUR 82/mtCO2e.

""They have the same volume, but it's a substantial difference in this price just within those three months.""

The EUA price has averaged around EUR 73.41/mtCO2e so far this year, with a low of EUR 60/mtCO2e in April and a high of EUR 83/mtCO2e in November, according to Ship & Bunker data.

""I think a lot of companies don't necessarily understand the implications of this, because of course if you don't include that into your contract ... if you are a bit delaying the purchase or not having a proper strategy around it, then having these types of changes in prices could have a significant impact on the compliance cost and how it's spread out to your stakeholders and customers,"" Braathen said.

""You have what becomes a competitive advantage if you manage to time the purchase correctly, and what could be a significant disadvantage compared to your competitors if you buy at a terrible price level.""

IMO Delay

Another area Blue Energy might be interested in engaging with would be the IMO's Net-Zero Framework, which if adopted would include an element of buying and selling GHG compliance units to meet its thresholds.

The UN body's Marine Environment Protection Committee decided in October to put off a vote on the framework by a year.

Braathen questions whether consensus can be reached to pass the deal in its current format within that timeframe, but remains optimistic over the long-term prospects for global GHG regulation for shipping.

""At the moment, with all the lobbying from the US side, it is challenging to see how they will manage to change that sentiment within the year,"" she said.

""But the IMO have the opportunity now to maybe simplify it a bit and look at what they could actually control, It's not necessarily all about the financial aspects of this carbon framework.

""But of course, I am quite positive.

""I believe that at some point there will be a global carbon market for shipping; whether it's next year, or if it will take more time, let's see.

Imports of steel into the European Economic Area will face a carbon tax under the EU’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) starting on January 1. The decarbonisation-oriented levy will also apply to cement, electricity, fertilisers and other products.

Mills in India, the world’s second-largest crude steel producer after China, ship roughly two-thirds of their exports to Europe.

Experts say Indian mills will need to cut their carbon emissions.

“We recognise that we have to do environment-friendly production and companies are gearing up to comply, but they are also looking at alternative markets too,” Aruna Sharma, India’s former steel secretary, told Reuters.

Most of India’s steel is produced in blast furnaces, which generate higher emissions, said Sandeep Poundrik, the top civil servant at the Ministry of Steel, in September. He also said further expansion of blast furnace capacity is a concern.

Additional planned capacity could add about 680 million metric tons of carbon-dioxide-equivalent emissions from the sector, according to Global Energy Monitor, a U.S.-based research group.

Indian steelmakers have planned new investments to lift output as strong domestic demand – fuelled by government-backed infrastructure spending – continues to rise.

“Most of the companies are yet figuring out a way to deal with CBAM,” said Ravi Sodah, a cement, metals and mining analyst at Elara Capital. “In the near term, it is expected to slow down India’s exports to EU.”

One way to mitigate the problem is to use electric arc furnaces, which emit far less carbon than conventional blast furnaces.

Two executives at large Indian steelmakers, who asked not to be named because they are not authorised to speak to the media, said companies had little clarity on how the tax would be calculated.

“About 60% of our exports go to Europe and we want to know what is the rate that will be levied and will it be company specific?” said one of the executives.

The levy will raise the cost of Indian steel exports to the EU, especially blast furnace products, squeezing margins and EU market share unless producers cut emissions, said Lakshmanan R, head of South & Southeast Asia corporates at CreditSights in Singapore.",,N,,2025-12-07 17:56:10.847008

According to Gibson, “whilst both the CPS and STEPS scenarios are more pragmatic relative to the NZE, they still paint a diverging picture for global oil demand.
Under the CPS, demand rises steadily from 100 mbd in 2024 to 105.3 mbd by 2035, and to 112.8 mbd by 2050.

The overall trend is broadly similar in STEPS, although increases in refining runs in Asia and Africa are considerably smaller.","It seems that the tanker market will experience diverging paths amongst its various classes, but mainly between crude and product tanker in the years to come. In its latest weekly report, shipbroker Gibson said that “the 2025 edition of the IEA’s World Energy Outlook (WEO) arrived at a moment of mounting turbulence, driven by geopolitical tensions, major changes in energy policies and increasing debate how to address climate risks. Updated each year with the latest data and market trends, the WEO is not a forecast but an exploration of possible energy futures shaped by evolving policies, technologies, and market forces. In this year’s edition, three key pathways are detailed. The Current Policies Scenario (CPS), last published prior to Covid, is re-introduced in this year’s addition and assumes no new governmental policy actions beyond those already in place. It presents a cautious view of how quickly new energy technologies can be scaled up. The Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) takes the analysis one step further and incorporates all officially announced government plans, even though they have not yet been adopted. Barriers to adopting new technologies are lower than in the CPS. The Net Zero Emissions (NZE) Scenario is theoretical and lists the conditions required to achieve net-zero CO₂ by 2050”.

According to Gibson, “whilst both the CPS and STEPS scenarios are more pragmatic relative to the NZE, they still paint a diverging picture for global oil demand. Under the CPS, demand rises steadily from 100 mbd in 2024 to 105.3 mbd by 2035, and to 112.8 mbd by 2050. Growth is underpinned by increased use of oil in road transport in emerging market and developing economies, aviation, shipping and petrochemical demand. Here, the assumption is made that the share of EVs in total car sales plateaus after 2035 at around 40%. In contrast, STEPS shows oil demand flattening near 100.4 mbd by 2035 before easing to around 96.9 mbd in 2050, reflecting faster uptake of electric vehicles and higher efficiency standards. Still, even by 2050 demand remains at robust levels despite faster electrification and more aggressive government policies to reduce GHG emissions”.

Meanwhile, “supply growth is dominated by the Middle East, although the scale differs between the scenarios, with production up by 13.7 mbd by 2050 in CPS and by 6.9 mbd in STEPS. Latin America also sees strong growth, although on a much smaller scale. In North America, production rises through 2035 but declines thereafter, with a sharper downward trend in STEPS. Oil production in Europe and Asia Pacific declines sharply in both scenarios. In Asia, a region that accounts for much of global demand growth, supply falls by 2.6 mbd or 3.2 mbd by 2050 depending on the case. Meanwhile, Africa’s production falls significantly in STEPS, while remaining broadly steady-ish in CPS”, the shipbroker noted.

“Global refining runs also evolve differently. A much stronger demand base under CPS drives significant throughput increases in Asia in both the medium and long term, whilst smaller yet notable increases are also seen in the Middle East, Africa, and North America. European runs continue to decline due to structural weakness in regional demand and competitive disadvantages relative to refineries East of Suez and the US. The overall trend is broadly similar in STEPS, although increases in refining runs in Asia and Africa are considerably smaller. Still, the main difference involves the US runs, where throughput comes under downward pressure in line with a faster demand decline”, Gibson noted.

So, what will be the impact on tankers? According to the shipbroker, “the CPS provides a much more optimistic view for tanker demand than STEPS, but the reality is likely to sit somewhere in between. Much depends on the pace of technological development and future government policy choices. Still, even with different demand paths, several tanker trade trends are consistent across both scenarios. Rising crude production in Latin America, falling refining runs in Europe, declining oil output but rising refining runs in Asia – they all point to incremental long-haul crude trade. Both scenarios also show solid growth in Middle East crude exports”.",,N,,2025-12-07 17:56:17.205730

Saleem Khan, Chief Data & Analytics Officer, Pole Star Global explains.

The Paradox

The maritime industry faces a paradox: recently Yemen’s Houthi rebels signalled a cessation of Red Sea attacks following the recent Gaza ceasefire. Around the same time, Iran executed its first vessel seizure in months, seizing the Marshall Islands-flagged tanker Talara in the Strait of Hormuz on Friday, 14 November 2025. These two developments underscore a critical reality: regional maritime security remains fragmented, unpredictable, and expensive.

After 690 days of Houthi attacks that killed nine mariners and sank four vessels, the conditional ceasefire offers cautious optimism. Yet, Suez Canal traffic remains at historic lows, averaging just 36 vessels daily in 2025 compared to 74 in 2023. Insurance premiums tell the story though and insurers aren’t convinced. Red Sea war-risk rates remain elevated despite the announcement; as underwriters demand proof through multiple safe transits, before reducing coverage costs that currently add tens of thousands of dollars per voyage.

Iran’s seizure of the Talara, carrying 30,000 tons of petrochemicals through waters handling 20% of global oil trade, signals Tehran’s willingness to reassert control in the Strait of Hormuz. The incident prompted war-risk premiums in the Middle East Gulf to double within days, while hull and machinery insurance jumped 60%.

Impact on Safe Passage

These developments have an impact on safe passage and come with three key implications:

1. Bifurcated Geographic Risk: The Red Sea may experience gradual normalisation while Persian Gulf risks intensify, forcing carriers to reassess route optimisation strategies across two distinct zones simultaneously.

2. Insurance Market Volatility: War-risk premiums will remain fluid and regionally specific, with 24-hour quote validities and 96-hour cancellation clauses now standard practice, eliminating predictable cost structures for voyage planning.

3. Extended Cape Routing Persistence: Despite the Houthi pause, major carriers will maintain Cape of Good Hope diversions through at least Q2 2026, sustaining 10-14 day transit delays and suppressing Suez Canal revenues while creating potential freight rate collapse when capacity eventually returns.

Stakeholder Actions

Stakeholders across the supply chain can implement various measures to deal with these challenges. Fleet owners should consider implementing dynamic voyage insurance strategies with multiple underwriters, rather than single-carrier contracts. Exploring the use of real-time intelligence platforms for routing decisions that balance premium costs against time-charter economics is also advised.

In comparison, cargo insurers ought to adopt granular, passage-level risk assessment using vessel ownership transparency data and beneficial owner verification to differentiate premium pricing. They would also do well to consider fleet-based bundling arrangements for operators with strong compliance records.

Port authorities can act by enhancing berth scheduling flexibility to accommodate last-minute routing changes. It is also recommended to coordinate with maritime security agencies on threat intelligence, sharing protocols for vessels calling from high-risk transit zones.

Vessel crews can act by verifying that comprehensive war-risk coverage explicitly includes Red Sea and Persian Gulf waters before transit; and it is worthwhile maintaining heightened vigilance for GPS jamming and AIS interference, particularly near the Straits of Hormuz and Bab el-Mandeb chokepoints.",,N,,2025-12-07 17:56:34.916580

Theofilos Mozas from Greece. This session addresses critical issues from maritime security enhancements to regulatory frameworks for emerging technologies and certification requirements. The discussions are key for shaping global safety standards aimed at protecting human lives and the environment.

### Addressing Maritime Security

A pressing concern includes rising threats in the Red Sea, highlighted by recent ship attacks and the hijacking of the MV Galaxy Leader. With more than 40 incidents reported, the MSC aims to implement measures to mitigate these risks and bolster the safety of seafarers in affected areas. A proposed resolution condemning these attacks underscores the urgent need for collective action against maritime security threats.

### Autonomous Shipping

As the industry moves towards autonomous vessels, the MSC is developing a non-mandatory code for Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships (MASS). This code is essential for integrating these ships safely into existing maritime operations while ensuring compliance with safety standards applicable to traditional vessels.

### Sustainable Maritime Operations

In response to climate change pressures, the committee is working on a safety regulatory framework to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from ships. This framework is pivotal for the IMO’s goal of achieving net-zero emissions in shipping through the adoption of innovative technologies and alternative fuels. It will address safety complexities and risks associated with implementing low-emission technologies.

### Protecting Seafarers

The committee’s agenda also focuses on the human element in maritime operations, particularly addressing violence and harassment. Proposed amendments to the Seafarers’ Training, Certification, and Watchkeeping Code (STCW Code) aim to enhance protections for seafarers, providing essential training and support to combat abuse and harassment.

### Modifications to Certification Standards

Recognizing the need for updated certification requirements, the MSC is seeking to revise the International Convention on Training, Certification, and Watchkeeping for Fishing Vessel Personnel (STCW-F Convention). These adjustments will cater to the evolving fishing industry, standardize qualifications, and improve safety for fishing vessel workers.

### Addressing Other Emerging Challenges

The MSC’s agenda includes reviewing safety measures outlined in the 1974 SOLAS Convention, tackling piracy and armed robbery, and analyzing reports from its subcommittees. Their comprehensive approach also focuses on improving navigational aids and ensuring the safe transport of hazardous cargo.",https://maritimefairtrade.org/wp-content/uploads/pwa/icon-192.png,N,,2025-12-07 10:56:10.794402

US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer has been at the very heart of the US policy maelstrom that rocked global shipping in 2025.

USTR policies on port fees have forced widespread vessel deployments, and tariffs based on USTR investigations have caused global shifts in cargo flows. Some shipowners have profited; others have lost.

The shipping industry was forced into Herculean efforts on contingency planning, only to see the port fees paused for a year on November 10 as part of the US-China trade agreement.

Countless ships were rerouted, vessels were refinanced to remove Chinese sale-leaseback exposure, time and money was spent on rebuttals to USTR proposals, and it all ended up being a bargaining chip in a much bigger game.

02 / Li Chenggang, China International Trade Representative

China, for whom Li Chenggang is the International Trade Representative, responded to the US port fee plan with tit-for-tat fees for ships linked to the US, calling them “necessary acts of passive defence”.

Its measures largely mirrored those of the US, even down to the lack of clarity about how “ownership” and “vessel operator” were defined.

There was consternation over how China would calculate the 25% US ownership threshold — but fees on all US-listed fleets would be far-reaching.

Fearnley Securities estimated the extra costs per call at $6m for a very large crude carrier, $5m for a capesize and $20 per tonne for a liquefied petroleum gas cargo.

03 / Marco Rubio, US State Secretary

Donald Trump’s White House and the departments of State and Energy were absent from the April meeting that approved the International Maritime Organization’s landmark Net-Zero Framework.

They more than made up for it next time round. State secretary Marco Rubio, energy secretary Chris Wright and transportation secretary Sean Duffy came out swinging against the NZF, and the economic threat it presented to the US (or more likely the relatively cheap political win it represented against UN agencies with green ambitions for industry) over the next six months.

What followed was an overwhelming show of diplomatic force to kill the NZF, including bullying, threats and intimidation against delegates from countries much weaker than the US. Rubio contacted several nations personally to promise retaliation if countries voted Yes.

The US and Saudi Arabia eventually won a one-year delay, which many think is the end of the IMO work plan — and thus the end of the industry hope of global carbon pricing.

04 / Mohammad Ayoub, Saudi Arabia (UNFCCC delegate)

While the headline-grabbing threats by the US were seen as the major blocker of the NZF, Saudi Arabia has long been the leader of the IMO bloc most opposed to green regulations.

The US and Saudi call to adopt the NZF under the old system of “explicit acceptance” — to ensure it never enters into force, even if it passes — was a deft procedural attack, throwing the EU and other delegates off guard and threatening to undermine the functioning of the IMO itself.

Saudi Arabia’s UNFCCC delegate, Mohammad Ayoub, was brought for this year’s two MEPCs to do what he does best: oppose, oppose, oppose.

Saudi Arabia also submitted several detailed documents listing the various reasons for countries to reject the green scheme they had approved just six months earlier, citing studies to argue carbon taxes would raise food prices for poor countries.

05 / Arsenio Dominguez, International Maritime Organization

Keeping October’s extraordinary MEPC meeting (there’s no better word for it) from going off the rails was arguably the biggest challenge an IMO secretary-general has yet faced.

Arsenio Dominguez narrowly avoided presiding over a rejection of the NZF, or a total collapse of the talks. He told delegates not to celebrate the outcome, but to “come back fresh in one year ready to negotiate”.

Dominguez made it his trademark never to answer when journalists asked what would happen should the NZF not be adopted. His job could well depend on whether it goes through next year.

06 / Sveinung Oftedal, chair, IMO ISWG-GHG (Norway delegate)

Norway’s IMO delegate Sveinung Oftedal chairs the IMO’s intersessional working group on greenhouse gases, ISWG-GHG. It is that forum, not the main chamber, where the real horse trading on carbon pricing usually takes place (perhaps because it’s closed to journalists).

Oftedal has sought gradually to build consensus on a plan that worked. He was instrumental in forming what became the NZF, which passed by a majority vote in April. That majority included Brazil and China, which had been significant critics.

Pacific Islands pushing for a flat carbon levy complained that their plan was sidelined, while the EU27 reckoned that such a levy would never fly. Oftedal got a global carbon price closer than anyone else has — no small achievement.

07 / Maria Angelicoussis, Angelicoussis Group

Greek shipowners have made no secret of their scepticism of carbon pricing. But the intervention in September by a group of six big players, led by Maria Angelicoussis, was important.

The support of the group, which has made big investments in liquefied natural gas fuel, was enough to sway the governments of Greece and Cyprus to abstain from the vote to postpone the framework, breaking with the rest of the EU27.

Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis has since called for Europe to rethink its green agenda more broadly. Let’s see how that plays out now that the EU’s are the only significant emissions rules for shipping in place for the foreseeable future.

08 / General Mamadi Doumbouya, junta leader, Guinea

After nearly 30 years, the $23bn Simandou mine is set to take the tiny African nation of Guinea from nowhere to the world’s third-biggest iron ore exporter.

The biggest mining project on the planet has the potential to reshape the global iron ore trade, giving China the advantage and displacing the dominance of Australia’s Pilbara region, with big ramifications for dry bulk shipping.

General Mamadi Doumbouya, who seized power in Guinea in 2021, is arguably more responsible than any other person for making Simandou happen, forcing mining giant Rio Tinto and its Chinese partners to share the huge costs of developing a railway and port.

09 / Magda Kopczynska, Fotini Ioannidou and Apostolos Tzitzikostas, European Commission

The setback at the IMO makes the European Commission — represented in this list by Magda Kopczynska, Fotini Ioannidou and Apostolos Tzitzikostas — the most significant regulator of shipping’s environment impacts for the foreseeable future.

The ETS and FuelEU Maritime regulations continue to be implemented, and a small industry has sprung up in response on advising companies how to pool and trade compliance surplus to avoid having to pay for biofuels or penalties.

The commission has kept shtum on whether it plans to carry out its threat to extend the schemes to cover 100% of voyages to and from EU ports, from 50% today, if the IMO does not deliver.

But another IMO delay in 2026, or a failure of the NZF altogether, makes such a tax hike far more likely.

10 / Emanuele Grimaldi and Thomas Kazakos, International Chamber of Shipping

The shipowners’ association, the International Chamber of Shipping, continues to be the main voice of the industry in IMO debates. It will have its work cut out for it next year as the role of industry associations diminishes and great-power politics takes over the carbon price debate.

But the ICS — represented in this list by Emanuele Grimaldi and Thomas Kazakos — remains influential in lobbying governments on industry topics including safety and security, alternative fuels and seafarer well-being.

Hi, Diana Stinson, President and owner of Texas Global Services. First of all, thank you for reading my blog. Also, this is a wonderful article by the Chamber (International Chamber of Shipping). Although, the author is unknown, this article shows the shipping industry coming in strong to meet the ambitious CO2 emissions target set by the IMO. Decarbonizing shipping and using zero-carbon technologies seems so far off. 2030 is just five years away and there needs to be a 40% efficiency improvement? I don’t see it happening that fast but I see the solution happening that fast. Hydrogen, ammonia and electricity powered ships? Wind powered ships? These ideas are bold and I love to share them with you. Are they realistic you ask. This cannot be in production already, can it?

The Blue Marlin Inland Solar cargo ship is already in operation. It is a hybrid ship that uses solar power to bring their emissions down considerably. Also, can be powered on solar alone for limited time. So the short answer is yes. These ideas are bold and they are realistic. The 106,000 HP engine that runs container ships is a huge ask to replace. Using ideas that reduce these emissions is the least we can do. Are we doing more? Yes. Pyxis Ocean’s maiden voyage was in June of this year. She is a wind powered hybrid that has experienced over 1/3 reduction in emissions using rigid sails. Hydrogen cell using vessels are in production for inland cargo ships and a California Coastal Research Vessel. I do see even bigger ideas becoming realities. Norway has a Sea Zero that is amazing. Fully electric cruise ship with retractable sails to be used on coastal Norwegian routes.

I’m very happy with the things I’m seeing to reduce the amount of carbon from the shipping industry. My industry of 22 years. There is much to be done. How much is in production I am unsure. The solutions have come and they are being implemented. There’s many cargo ships in the world, 58,000 says Google. I see opportunities for new companies and existing companies. Humanity comes together when they are needed the most. We are seeing that now. I’m still proud to be moving freight and am looking to the future that is coming fast.",https://www.texasglobalservices.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/hydrogen-ship-Copy.jpg,N,,2025-12-06 12:56:08.685415
