The vessels will further expand AET’s growing dual-fuel fleet operating worldwide. With these orders, AET will have dual-fuel capability in all the tanker sectors it operates in – Aframaxes, Shuttle Tankers, Suezmaxes and Very Large Crude Carriers (VLCCs). The orders reflect AET’s continued investment in cleaner and more energy-efficient shipping solutions, and its commitment to advancing the maritime industry’s transition towards lower-carbon operations in support of global net-zero goals.

Each vessel will feature advanced technologies to enhance efficiency and environmental performance, including:

Everllence 6G70ME-C10.5-GI main engine, designed for fuel efficiency and to minimise methane-slip.

SVESSEL Intelligent Smart Ship Solution, enabling real-time monitoring and data-driven optimisation of performance and safety.

SAVER Stator-D (Duct), SARB (Rudder Bulb) and SAVER-Fins to enhance hydrodynamic efficiency and reduce fuel consumption.

Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) systems and a hybrid vertical bow design that further improve propulsion efficiency and lower emissions.

LNG is one of several alternative fuel pathways AET is pursuing, alongside ammonia and other emerging low-carbon fuels, as part of its Energy Transition Strategy. When operating on LNG, by design dual-fuel vessels can emit between 14% to 23% less greenhouse gases (GHG) on a well-to-wake basis than those using conventional marine fuels, while significantly reducing particulate matter (PM), sulphur oxides (SOₓ) and nitrogen oxides (NOₓ)1.

In addition to these savings, LNG from alternative feedstocks namely Bio-LNG and e-LNG offer a long-term and scalable solution to deep decarbonisation for the industry. These forms of LNG while nascent in their use as marine fuel offer significant incremental GHG emissions savings beyond (fossil) LNG based savings and utilise the same infrastructure2.

Nick Potter, President & CEO of AET, said: “This marks another important step in building a more sustainable fleet and supporting our customers’ decarbonisation ambitions. With these newbuilds, our dual-fuel fleet will grow to 18 vessels3, a clear demonstration of the progress we’re making in delivering more energy with less emissions.",,N,,2025-11-07 23:56:11.774558

Friday, November 7, 2025

I made the case last month in “Hey Ho, IMO Has Gotta Go!” that the Trump administration, not only rightly persuaded the IMO (International Maritime Organization) to delay a pseudo carbon tax on global shipping, but they should pull out of this climate scheme or scam all together.

Another specialized agency of the UN met not long ago as well, but unlike IMO, they managed to ‘fly under the radar,’ pun intended, of the federal cabinet and right leaning media. That was the triennial meeting of ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization) in September.

As the International Air Transport Association (IATA) put it: “As you can imagine, with a commitment to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050,…CORSIA—the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation—[was] in the spotlight…[at] this critical meeting[.]”

CORSIA “is the first global market-based scheme that applies to a sector,” boasts ICAO. And ICAO “adopted CORSIA in 2016 as the global carbon offsetting mechanism for aviation, rejecting carbon taxes and levies as effective solutions,” according to IATA.

“How does CORSIA work?” asks IATA. Their answer: “It requires airlines to purchase and cancel [Eligible Emissions Units (EEUs)] to offset their emissions over and above 85% of 2019 emissions.”

IATA goes on to note: “But there’s a big challenge: There aren’t enough EEUs on the market for airlines to purchase. … The resulting scarce supply of EEUs also distorts the market and drives up the price of the EEUs.”

However, according to Forbes in 2024: “There’s no current real-world data showing a direct correlation between the price of carbon credits for offsetting and airline ticket prices. … However,…as credits become more expensive or harder to find, the cost for airlines will rise.”

Also in 2024, IATA found that fuel costs were “28.7% of total airline costs” but these vary “significantly by region” such as “36.3%” “in Latin America and the Caribbean” “compared to 25.5% in North America.” And that capital costs of “depreciation and amortization make up 9.1%.”

In addition, a 2025 historical study of the pass-through by domestic aviation of fuel costs between 2000 to 2019, found that “the estimated results for 10% firm-specific fuel price increase are 2.4%, 2.9% and 1.3%,” for legacy, low-cost, and ultra-low-cost carriers respectively.

Regarding in maritime shipping, one projection for the price rise of fuel costs is 350%. And such costs have been estimated as representing “between 50–60 % of a ship’s operating cost.” Some media reports suggested that shipping prices could, thus, increase by more than 10%.

In contrast to the price hikes expected in international shipping, those in international aviation are forecasted to be quite miniscule by comparison. For example, some 2024 modeling estimated an increment “of less than USD $2 per ticket in Phase I and up to USD $5 in Phase II.”

Barack Obama once ‘said the quiet part out loud’ in 2008 regarding all these climate schemes: “Under my plan of a cap-and-trade system, electricity rates would necessarily skyrocket.” It is unclear whether that is also the aim for CORSIA, after it becomes mandatory from 2027.

CORSIA’s apparent inability to make airline fares skyrocket, so far or anytime soon, has fueled, pun intended, not only much criticism from climate lobbyists, but also increasing allegations of “greenwashing” as well as green or climate “fraud.”

Stay Grounded accused the aviation industry of being “a greenwashing best practice case” because “CORSIA covers only a tiny part of aviation emissions [and] is a way for the industry to cheaply buy themselves out of climate commitments…like eliminating…fuel tax exemptions[.]”

Transport & Environment (T&E) went even further: “Offsetting is a climate fraud, perpetuated on unsuspecting passengers by an industry resisting real climate action. CORSIA is a non-starter[.] [And] ICAO…will never rise to the challenge of aviation’s climate problem.”

Fraud is defined as “a misrepresentation of fact that was either intentional or negligent.” Elements include: “The speaker…intended…whom the statement was made would rely on it. The hearer must then have reasonably relied on the promise and [was] harmed because of that reliance.”

Such terms are not mere semantics, as Dutch airline KLM’s “environmental measures” were deemed by the District Court of Amsterdam in 2024 to be “greenwashing,” declared “misleading due to being too vague,” and ruled to “only marginally reduce the negative environmental aspects.”

As in the case of IMO’s net zero scheme, President Trump 47 has issued executive orders at odds with ICAO’s CORSIA, such as: Putting America First In International Environmental Agreements; Reducing Anti-competitive Regulatory Barriers; and Leading The World In Supersonic Flight.

T&E warns: “Did Europe really think they could pass [IMO’s] global climate deal, (wrongly) dubbed the first global carbon tax, without a huge fight? … If Europe is not willing to seriously face off with Trump, it can forget about global deals…CORSIA being the prime example.”

Comparing jet fuel PPI (producer price index) from 1975 to 2025, vis-à-vis climate alarmism, is instructive. The high, low and average prior to Al Gore’s post-2000 climate crusade were: 109 (1990); 37 (1999); and 62. Since then: high 435 (2022); low 105 (2016); and average 202.

Even though ICAO and CORSIA have appeared to have caused little-to-no direct price harm to international airlines and passengers so far, nor are predicted to, the Trump administration should embrace the “precautionary principle” so beloved by the climate “bootleggers and baptists.”

That means getting out of CORSIA, before the mandatory phase starts in 2027. That might also mean withdrawing from ICAO too, before they, as a UN agency like the IPCC, eventually try to follow IMO with a global carbon tax. This is because, paraphrasing Star Wars:

“We must move quickly. The [globalists] are relentless. If they are not all [defunded], it will be civil war without end. … We will catch them off balance. … Do not hesitate, show no mercy! Only then, will you be strong enough with the [right] side to save [America].”

The plan to step up financing for sustainable fuels in shipping and aviation by 2027 comes as the bloc is falling short of decarbonising heavy transport by 2050.

The European Commission announced a €2.9 billion plan to scale up investments in green fuels by 2027 to curb carbon dioxide emissions from aviation and maritime transport, which together account for roughly 26.4% of EU transport-sector emissions.

With the EU’s binding climate goal of achieving climate-neutrality by 2050, compared to 1990 levels, slashing emissions in aviation and maritime transport is both essential and challenging for the EU27.

Commercial planes and ships are the hardest transports to decarbonise, and to this day they are still powered mainly by fossil fuels, despite EU legislation meant to help the shipping and aviation sectors to become climate-neutral.

“The package is about strengthening Europe’s competitiveness while moving decisively towards a net-zero future. By investing in scaling up renewable and low-carbon fuels, we are making Europe’s transport system cleaner, more resilient and more affordable for citizens,” said Commissioner for Sustainable Transport and Tourism Apostolos Tzitzikostas.

The EU executive estimates that around 20 million tonnes of sustainable fuels, including biofuels and e-fuels, will be needed by 2035 to meet green fuel targets for aviation and maritime transport. Achieving this will require an estimated €100 billion in investment, the Commission stated.

The nearly €3 billion announced on Wednesday is expected to be disbursed from the EU’s multiannual budget, running until 2027, to be invested in renewable and low-carbon fuel technologies.

Under existing EU law, the maritime sector must reduce its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2% from 2025, compared to 2020 levels. By 2050, shipping is expected to reduce its GHG intensity by 80%.

The aviation sector is expected to have 20% of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) — feedstocks like used cooking oil, agricultural waste and captured carbon — supplied at EU airports from 2035. Five per cent needs to be e-SAF — a type of synthetic jet fuel made from carbon dioxide, water, and renewable electricity.

By 2050, green fuels for aviation must account for 70%, of which 35% must be eSAF.

However, available and estimated volumes of bio and e-SAF are far from meeting the post-2030 green fuel needs for aviation, according to the Commission.

“Mandates alone do not create a functioning SAF market, and it is high time we collectively admit that and take action to accelerate affordable SAF,” Ourania Georgoutsakou, managing director of the aviation lobby group Airlines for Europe (A4E), said in a statement.

“Ultimately, reducing SAF costs is essential to ensuring air travel remains accessible to all while reinforcing the competitiveness of European airlines,” A4E stated.

e-fuels and biofuels

More than 40 e-fuel production projects are at a planning stage in the EU, but none have yet reached a final investment decision, the Commission said.

Challenges in scaling up e-fuels are hampered by the availability, cost and maturity of renewable energy, eligible carbon storage and capture technologies and the energy intensity linked to generating green hydrogen.

Antony Froggatt, senior director for aviation, shipping and energy at the campaign group T&E, welcomed the Commission’s plan and the inclusion of e-fuels.

“For the first time, the EU will develop an effective financial instrument to kickstart production. The EU must now follow through on these commitments if it is to help preserve Europe’s technological leadership in e-fuels,” Froggatt said.

Concerns were raised about the use of biofuels, which Froggatt said would only “detract from” commitments to e-fuels.

“It is crucial that only e-fuels be eligible for the auctions as there are no market barriers for biofuels production”, T&E stated, in reference to the European Hydrogen Bank auction due by the end of the year with a €300 million window for aviation and maritime projects. This is part of the €2.9 billion unveiled by the Commission.

Jim Corbett, World Shipping Council’s (WSC) environmental director, said the Commission’s plan was a “promising first step” to accelerate the energy transition in shipping in Europe.",,N,,2025-11-07 17:56:14.544071

Cleaner fuel-burning ships accounted for 37% of cargo vessel orders in the first 10 months of 2025, unchanged from the year-ago period, as buyers were uncertain about when global rules for cutting maritime emissions will take effect, data from shipping consultancy AXSMarine showed.

Overall gross tonnage (GT), an industry measure for vessel capacity, totaled 78 million from January through October, down from 113 million from the year-ago period, AXSMarine data showed.

Orders for all of 2024 surged to a 17-year high after ships were rerouted to avoid Houthi rebel attacks in the Red Sea, a process that required putting more ships in use to maintain schedules on the longer voyages. Operators were also preparing for new environmental regulations from the United Nations' standard-setting authority for international shipping.

Orders for alternative fuel ships were roughly 29 million GT in the first 10 months of this year, down from 42 million GT in the year-earlier period, according to AXSMarine data.

But uncertainty spiked again last month when, under pressure from delegates from the United States and Saudi Arabia, member countries of the U.N.'s International Maritime Organization, voted to postpone for one year a decision that would have helped to set global carbon-reduction targets and to punish or reward adherence to those goals.

""With the IMO's Net-Zero Framework vote delayed, a 'wait-and-see' approach now seems the most likely outcome,"" said Alexander Hadzhigaev, AXSMarine's vice president of data, referring to future ordering.

Maritime shipping transports about 80% of global trade. The industry accounts for about 3% of climate-warming greenhouse gases, a percentage poised to climb without curbs.

Major container shipping lines like Maersk MAERSK_A and Hapag-Lloyd HLAG said they will move forward with efforts to cut carbon emissions from their ships.

More than 70% of capacity ordered by container ship and vehicle carrier operators from January to October was alternative-fuel capable, compared with only 10-15% for bulkers and tankers, Hadzhigaev said.

Liquefied natural gas remained the dominant alternative fuel, making up 29% of total orders so far this year. Methanol stands at 9%, and ammonia and other fuels combined represent about 1%, he said.

In the container sector, enthusiasm for methanol has cooled, with its share of new orders dropping from 48% in 2023 and 18% in 2024 to just 10% in 2025, as fuel availability and cost remain key challenges, AXSMarine data showed.",https://s.tradingview.com/static/images/illustrations/news-story.jpg,N,,2025-11-07 14:00:37.433912

IDB Debuts “Amazonia Bond” to Fund High-Impact ESG Initiatives

The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) has raised $100 million from its first Amazonia Bond. This funding will support important environmental and social projects throughout the Amazon region.

This first bond comes after the Amazonia Bond platform was launched in July 2025 by the IDB and the World Bank. The platform aims to attract private investment for sustainable development in the Amazon. The IDB hopes to raise up to $1 billion with more bonds in the future.

The program will use the funds for projects that fight deforestation, land damage, and illegal mining. It will also support good governance, climate resilience, and social inclusion. Projects must meet three main goals: reduce poverty, protect natural resources, and encourage inclusive, sustainable growth.

After this bond was issued, Brazil’s National Treasury showed interest in possibly issuing its own sovereign bonds under the Amazon Bonds Guidelines.

Corporations that are focused on meeting emissions targets can seek guidance from ESG tools.

Over 20 Airlines Agree to Revise Environmental Claims After Greenwashing Probe

The European Commission has made a deal with over 20 airlines, such as Air France, Lufthansa, and KLM, to change or remove misleading environmental claims. Some airlines had suggested that paying extra fees or using sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) could completely cancel out flight emissions.

This decision came after the European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) filed a complaint in 2023. The group said airlines misled passengers with false “green” marketing and called for refunds of deceptive environmental surcharges.

After the complaint, the EU Commission and Consumer Protection Cooperation (CPC) found several examples of greenwashing. These included using unclear terms like “sustainable” or “responsible” and making net-zero promises without proof. Airlines have now agreed to make sure all environmental statements are accurate, clear, and backed by evidence.

Companies committed to clean energy and corporate transparency should use ESG solutions.

Senate Republicans Oppose Resolution Aimed at Prohibiting Military Intervention in Venezuela

Senate Republicans voted 51 to 49 on Thursday to block a measure that would have stopped the Trump administration from taking military action in Venezuela without approval from Congress. Most Republicans opposed the measure, but Rand Paul and Lisa Murkowski joined Democrats in supporting it.

Senator Tim Kaine, a Democrat from Virginia and co-sponsor of the resolution, said it was meant to prevent a possible land invasion of Venezuela. He stressed that the resolution addressed more than just recent U.S. strikes on suspected drug boats in Latin America.

Those against the measure argued that the president has full authority as commander in chief. Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, described Venezuela under President Nicolás Maduro as an “existential threat” and defended the administration’s right to take military action.

The vote came after reports of at least 15 U.S. military strikes in the region since September, which have led to more than 60 deaths.

Numerous actions are being implemented at the global, regional and national level aimed at achieving that goal.

In 2021 IMO adopted the short-term GHG reduction measure, putting in place mandatory energy efficiency requirements requiring ships to progressively reduce their carbon intensity (EEXI and CII), thereby reducing fuel consumption per tonne/mile transported. Latest fuel consumption data reported to the IMO demonstrate an improvement of carbon intensity between 31 and 38% (depending on the metric used), compared to 2008, thus nearing the 40% target for 2030 as set out in the IMO GHG Strategy.

Further energy efficiency improvements can reduce fuel consumption and boost innovation in all ship segments. Rapid technological development in propeller design, air lubrication systems, wind propulsion, hull coating, and just-in-time operations lowered CAPEX and OPEX costs, and faster payback periods.

Ports continue to pursue partnerships along green maritime corridors, and currently over 60 of these corridors are at different stages of development, nourishing crucial first-mover experience in the use of alternative fuels, safe bunkering, shore-power, and forging demand for zero and near-zero emission fuels and technologies through cooperation in industrial clusters in ports areas.

IMO’s support to countries to develop National Action Plans further reinforces cooperation between the shipping, ports and energy sectors, as well as the financial sector to enhance access to finance for shipbuilding and retrofits.

Shipping plays an important role in the global energy transition, enabling the transport of low-emission fuels from their production locations to high-energy demand centers, also allowing ships to use those fuels for propulsion.

IMO is in the process of developing a next set of regulatory measures that will further chart the course of shipping’s energy transition towards net-zero, facilitating global trade, creating new opportunities for alternative fuel producing countries, supporting related maritime infrastructure development, and safeguarding reliable and affordable shipping for the many States depending on shipping as their lifeline to the world’s markets.

This event will focus on current action; and recommendations on how IMO and other stakeholders can further prompt the energy transition of shipping through

appropriate regulatory measures and broader enabling frameworks; including first-mover action and support mechanisms, notably for developing countries, in particular SIDS and LDCs, to ensure that no one is left behind.

Governments and other public entities, international organizations, industry and civil society representatives are invited to join this dialogue, and share their valuable insights on the necessary next steps in shipping’s energy transition.

A report by UK sustainability consultancy Leafr published in late October suggested most companies in Europe won’t hit their sustainability targets.","Progress on countering global warming, both tempering the rise in global temperatures and mitigating its impact, appears increasingly stalled.

The 42nd assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) closed in mid-October with no progress in addressing criticisms of ICAO’s Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (Corsia) despite producing a 26-page resolution.

It merely reaffirmed a global commitment to net zero carbon emissions by 2050 – ICAO’s ‘Long-Term Aspirational Goal’ – and endorsed Corsia as the single global market-based measure for crediting offsets.

But Corsia only applies to emissions above 85% of 2019 levels so will cover only about a quarter of international aviation emissions in Europe by 2035 and an analysis of credits issued by the middle of this year, involving a tree-planting programme in Guyana, found 84% did not represent real emission reductions.

Separately, a deal to reduce shipping’s global emissions was abandoned this month under pressure from the US and Saudi Arabia when representatives of more than 100 countries met to approve an International Maritime Organisation (IMO) Net-Zero Framework deal.

This would have seen shipping, including cruise, adopt global targets for emissions reduction.

Both setbacks came as the UK Climate Change Committee, which reports to the government on progress on emissions reduction, urged ministers to prepare for 2C warming by 2050, warning Britian is “not yet adapted” to current weather extremes “let alone” those to come.

Baroness Brown, chair of the adaptation committee, wrote to Department for Environment minister Emma Hardy whose responsibilities include net zero, climate change and adaptation, saying: “Adaptation is not keeping up with the increase in climate risk.”

She urged the government to prepare “at a minimum for the weather extremes if global warming levels reach 2°C above pre-industrial levels by 2050”.

In April, the committee declared current preparations “too slow, stalled or heading in the wrong direction”.

A report by UK sustainability consultancy Leafr published in late October suggested most companies in Europe won’t hit their sustainability targets.

Based on a survey of 450 sustainability leads across UK and EU businesses, the True State of Sustainability 2025 report found only 11% confident their organisation is on track – down from 24% a year ago.

Three out of four (76%) reported their team is inadequately resourced, two thirds (67%) said their team was the same or smaller than last year, 62% cited budget constraints as a barrier, and 42% flagged lack of engagement at the top of company, double the rate in 2024.

Leafr said the findings “reflect pressures inside the companies responsible for the majority of corporate emissions"". Two-thirds of respondents represented large or enterprise-sized firms with 250-plus employees.

Gus Bartholomew, co-founder of Leafr, said: “Sustainability teams can’t deliver net zero on their own. They are under-resourced, pulled in too many directions and forced into compliance work at the expense of impact.

Fellow co-founder Nick Valenzia said: “Boards would never accept financial accounts prepared by unqualified staff yet they entrust multi-million-pound sustainability strategies to under-resourced teams.""",https://dcxnozgahgy2a.cloudfront.net/AcuCustom/Sitename/DAM/377/shuterstock-shipping-emissions11_Thumb.webp,N,,2025-11-07 16:03:11.880819

However, researchers caution that scaling up biofuel production without strict safeguards could undermine climate progress, displace communities, degrade ecosystems, and worsen food insecurity.
While some nations may achieve marginal emissions reductions through advanced biofuels or waste-based pathways, the global trend in biofuels consumption remains deeply unsustainable.
92% of projected 2030 biofuel demand is still expected to be met by food-type feedstocks.
This is highly relevant for exploring sustainable fuel alternatives within international aviation and shipping decarbonization frameworks, such as CORSIA and IMO.","Scientists and civil society groups are warning COP delegations and attendees about the risks posed by a rapid expansion of global biofuel demand. While often promoted as a low-carbon alternative to fossil fuels, biofuels, particularly those made from food and feed crops, may carry serious environmental and social consequences if their production grows unchecked.

Current demand from the road transport sector is set to rise further due to ambitious targets in aviation and shipping, including EU and national Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) mandates and the International Maritime Organization’s Net-Zero framework.

However, researchers caution that scaling up biofuel production without strict safeguards could undermine climate progress, displace communities, degrade ecosystems, and worsen food insecurity. Projections indicate that by 2030, the global cropland required for biofuels in the transport sector, excluding crop co-products, could reach 52 million hectares, a 63% increase from 2023 levels, which is roughly the size of France.

Experts note that this represents a highly inefficient use of land and agricultural resources. By comparison, only 3% of the current biofuels area would be needed to generate the same amount of energy from solar panels, which underscores the relative inefficiency of producing energy by burning crops.

While some nations may achieve marginal emissions reductions through advanced biofuels or waste-based pathways, the global trend in biofuels consumption remains deeply unsustainable. 92% of projected 2030 biofuel demand is still expected to be met by food-type feedstocks. Meanwhile, even optimistic estimates of biofuel life-cycle savings are often dwarfed by the carbon opportunity costs of not restoring land to forests or other natural systems.

The expansion of crop biofuels is not a climate solution. It is a costly detour.

… the experts highlight.

As COP30 approaches—an opportune moment of global reckoning and responsibility, the signatories call on world leaders to:

Prevent an uninhibited expansion of first-generation biofuels under international climate mechanisms or national plans;

Phase out subsidies and mandates for biofuels from food and feed crops, and redirect support to more sustainable energy solutions;

Prioritise investments in electrification and energy efficiency and sufficiency as primary strategies for decarbonizing road transport;

Prioritise land restoration and biodiversity protection over land conversion for fuel production;

Establish robust global sustainability criteria, verification procedures, and sufficient enforcement frameworks that justifiably account for indirect emissions, carbon opportunity costs, and social impacts. This is highly relevant for exploring sustainable fuel alternatives within international aviation and shipping decarbonization frameworks, such as CORSIA and IMO.

Finally, the scientists note that truly sustainable biofuels can play a limited role in decarbonising a narrow set of hard-to-electrify sectors, such as aviation, but this must not justify a blind embrace of policies that repeat past mistakes of relentless crop biofuels expansion.

The science is clear: we cannot burn our way to net zero, especially not at the expense of forests, food, and future generations. We urge you to reflect on this science in the decisions made at COP30.

There, they committed to aligning their operations with the Paris Agreement.
Yet even in the financial world, which is currently dumping its own low climate targets, there is no shortage of warnings about the economic consequences of climate disasters.
As Pakistani climate expert Ali T. Sheikh has commented, the climate is the first victim of militarism.
This can contribute to give new life to climate protests where Fridays for Future was interrupted by the pandemic.","A UN Environment Programme (UNEP) report released in November 2025 warns that the world is on a path to warm by approximately 2.8C this century if current policies are followed.

At a time when the world’s capitalist governments are completely preoccupied with rivalry between the imperialist superpowers, the military arms race, the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, nationalism, trade wars, and a spectacularly authoritarian and anti-science development in the US, the climate issue is one of the first victims.

With Donald Trump in power, the US has done everything it can to give the climate threat the finger. Under the mantra of “drill, baby, drill,” Trump, who was supported in the presidential election by huge contributions from oil companies, has ensured that the US has left the Paris Agreement and, in his much-publicized speech to the UN General Assembly in September, declared the climate issue to be “a hoax.”

Despite the fact that 70 percent of the world’s emissions can be traced to 100 global corporations, Trump has not only opened up oil exploration in nature reserves and on the seabed. He has also abolished 31 environmental protection regulations at home and stopped the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from even reporting on emissions from the US’s largest sources of emissions. As Politico and other media outlets have reported, the Department of Energy has even been banned from using words such as “climate change,” “green,” “emissions,” “energy transition,” “sustainability,” “clean or dirty energy,” and “carbon/CO2 footprint.”

This, as EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has cheerfully stated, drives “a stake through the heart of the climate change religion.”

Trump’s trade war has also secured a series of agreements on increased exports of oil and natural gas from the US, not least to Europe. Under threat of sanctions from the US and opposition from Saudi Arabia, Russia, and other oil-producing countries, a UN-led attempt to reach an international agreement on reducing emissions from global shipping within the International Maritime Organization (IMO) was halted as recently as October. This would have meant the first global tax on carbon dioxide emissions. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio called this a “huge victory for the White House.”

After Trump’s frontal attack on everything related to climate policy, the banks and oil and gas companies that pretended to play along for a few years after the 2015 Paris Agreement have quickly and brutally returned to “business as usual.” Despite the International Energy Agency (IEA) stating that no new oil and gas fields can be opened if the Paris Agreement targets are to be met, there has been a significant increase in investment in fossil fuels, supported by the world’s banks. As a result, oil and gas production, led by Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Norway, will continue to increase in the coming years, while the US and Canada will mainly increase natural gas production and China and India will mainly increase coal production.

Russia, for its part, is trying to circumvent sanctions by increasing exports to China and India to finance its war in Ukraine.

When American banks, including Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, and the whole of Wall Street, saw which way the wind was blowing after Donald Trump’s election victory, they quickly jumped ship from the so-called Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA), which was launched at COP26 in Glasgow in 2021. There, they committed to aligning their operations with the Paris Agreement. Canadian, Asian, and European banks such as HSBC, UBS, and Barclays quickly followed suit, until the NZBA was quietly shut down last month.

In the UK, where oil company BP has dumped its supposedly green ambitions, Keir Starmer’s Labour government is also expected to approve two new oil fields in the North Sea, Rosebank and Jackdaw, despite a Scottish court declaring them illegal. In Norway, where 100 new licenses have been granted in recent years, investment in oil and gas will reach a new record in 2025.

Even the major Swedish banks Nordea, SEB, and the AP7 pension fund have continued to invest heavily in new Norwegian oil. According to a review by Fair Finance Guide and the Swedish Society for Nature Conservation, Nordea has also removed previous restrictions on lending to particularly climate-damaging activities such as oil sands, shale oil, and exploration in the northern Arctic.

Incidentally, the Swedish oil family Lundin is a major shareholder in the oil company AkerBP, which has just discovered a huge new oil field in the Yggdrasil area of the Norwegian North Sea – according to AkerBP’s CEO, one of the largest commercial discoveries in a decade.

Although everyone knows that this paves the way for future climate disasters, investments already made and capitalism’s competition-driven profit requirements are forcing capital owners to act until the very end according to the same motto that Citigroup CEO Chuck Prince is said to have uttered in the summer of 2007, just before the subprime mortgage market blew up the financial system: “As long as the music is playing, you have to get up and dance. We’re still dancing.” This is made possible by the lack of massive popular and political resistance.

Few of the world’s media outlets have even bothered to report on the UN Climate Summit 2025, held shortly after the General Assembly meeting where UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called on world governments to close the yawning gap to the Paris Agreement targets at COP30 in Brazil.

Shortly before the opening of COP30, only a third of the world’s states have yet managed to present their national contributions to updated targets that should have been submitted long ago. Of those that have done so and are included in the count, the US has withdrawn.

Among those that have not yet managed to do so are the EU, which for decades has paraded as the climate leader of the capitalist world, and India. If the new climate plans submitted so far are implemented, which is unlikely, global emissions could be reduced by 17% by 2035 compared to 2019, according to a brand-new UN report.

But to achieve the Paris Agreement’s goal of limiting warming to two degrees, a 60% reduction is needed. None of the UN chief’s five priority measures have made any progress that comes close to what is required.

Guterres’ call for a “supercharge” of the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy, in line with the COP28 statement in Dubai on a “transition away” from fossil fuels, has had almost no effect. Despite rapid development of solar, wind, and electric cars, primarily in China, which is simultaneously building many new coal-fired power plants, this is not enough to break the capitalist world’s dependence on fossil fuels. The picture is equally bleak when it comes to “drastically reducing methane emissions.”

Nor is the world anywhere near the goal of “halting deforestation by 2030,” the destruction of the largest carbon sinks in land-based ecosystems. In Europe, logging is on the rise.

There is little prospect of “climate justice” for developing countries, in the form of financial support for debt relief, contributions to the “loss and damage fund”, or climate adaptation, which will be a central issue for the world’s poor countries at COP30, since the US left the Paris Agreement and phased out USAID. Despite increasingly frequent and severe climate disasters, most recently manifested by Hurricane Melissa’s rampage in Jamaica, Cuba, and Haiti, aid is being cut sharply in the shadow of the arms race, even from European countries such as Germany, France, and Sweden.

“The truth is that we have failed to avoid an overshooting above 1.5C in the next few years. And that going above 1.5C has devastating consequences. Some of these devastating consequences are tipping points, be it in the Amazon, be it in Greenland, or western Antarctica or the coral reefs”, Guterres admits to the Guardian. To the Amazon-based news organization Sumaúma, he emphasizes the need for a decisive shift.

But despite the fact that, according to the European State of the Climate 2024, Europe is the fastest warming continent, with 413,000 people severely affected by storms and floods, 335 deaths and 42,000 people affected by fires, the EU is undergoing a right-wing-driven loosening of the union’s already hopelessly inadequate “Green Deal”. All to meet the demands of companies for deregulation, clearly backed by the US, and increased competitiveness.

Yet even in the financial world, which is currently dumping its own low climate targets, there is no shortage of warnings about the economic consequences of climate disasters.

“The world is rapidly approaching temperature levels where insurance companies will no longer be able to offer protection for many climate risks,” says Günther Thallinger, board member of Allianz SE, one of the world’s largest insurance companies. Without insurance, which is already being withdrawn in some places, many other financial services will become unprofitable, from mortgages to investments.

COP30 was supposed to be a particularly important stage in the annual negotiations under the UN Climate Convention, where new and enhanced national climate plans would be developed, a global framework for climate adaptation would be established, and a new fund to protect tropical forests (TFFF) would be created. But with the 1.5-degree target already shattered, the governments of poor countries in particular have shifted their focus to demands for financial support for adaptation and reconstruction after climate disasters.

But even on that point, they are likely to be disappointed. As Pakistani climate expert Ali T. Sheikh has commented, the climate is the first victim of militarism. “The axe will fall on climate finance,” he said. “It will turn the world upside down and undo 30 years of climate cooperation since the first COP.”

Where governments fail, however, the new alarm raised by scientists and the thousands of participants from climate movements and indigenous peoples, who for the first time in several years will make their way to the negotiations in the heart of the Amazon, may serve as a wake-up call after several years of closed summits in authoritarian states. This can contribute to give new life to climate protests where Fridays for Future was interrupted by the pandemic.

Clearly inspired by the Gaza flotilla, indigenous leaders from across Latin America have boarded a flotilla from the banks of the Napo River in Coca, Ecuador, bound for Belém, Brazil, with the goal of reaching the UN climate summit. According to Democracy Now, members of the so-called Yaku Mama Amazon flotilla are demanding an end to fossil fuels, protection of indigenous territories and ecosystems from oil, mining, and industrial agriculture, and a ban on fossil fuel extraction in the Amazon rainforest.

For them, it is enraging that Brazilian President Lula da Silva himself has given hypocrisy a new face by defending the permit for new oil exploration near the mouth of the Amazon River with the argument that it is necessary to finance the transition to green energy.

In the shadow of warmongering and right-wing radicalization, awareness will sooner or later grow of the need for an anti-capitalist mass movement that can unite young and old climate and peace activists, trade unions, indigenous peoples, and social movements.

More and more people will realize the need to challenge the power of banks, big business, billionaires, and warmongers over the economy in order to begin a democratically planned and fundamental transformation of both production and how we live in balance with nature. The socialist insight that we cannot control and democratically plan what we do not own together, will grow.",https://internationalsocialist.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/cropped-logo-square3-250x250-1-32x32.jpg,N,,2025-11-07 09:00:52.074577

In addition, disruptions in the Red Sea forced ships onto longer routes, highlighting the urgent need for stronger carbon pricing and targeted climate policies.

Record emissions, flat trade volumes

Although trade volumes have remained practically unchanged, emissions continue to rise. This indicates that ships are becoming more polluting independently of the cargo they carry. The question arises: why is the shipping sector emitting more without transporting more goods?

Container ships drive the increase

Container ships are responsible for the entire increase in EU shipping emissions, with their emissions rising by 46%. Several factors contribute to this spike:

Longer routes: Red Sea disruptions have forced container ships to reroute around the Cape of Good Hope.

Higher speeds: To maintain delivery schedules, vessels are sailing faster, which increases fuel consumption and emissions.

More ships in operation: Additional vessels are deployed to meet operational demands.

These pressures have resulted in higher emissions per container ship, emphasizing the need for policies that address operational behaviors, reward energy efficiency, and support the use of e-fuels. Only through such measures can fuel consumption be reduced without slowing down global trade.

The role of fossil fuel transport

Shipping emissions are also influenced by the type of cargo transported. A large share of Europe’s shipping emissions comes from crude oil, LNG, and other fossil fuels. Key trends include:

Fossil fuel carriers: They continue to account for around 20% of EU shipping emissions.

Crude oil: Emissions from transporting crude oil imports have returned to 2019 levels.

LNG: Shipments had been growing since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine but decreased slightly in 2024.

The Netherlands, home to the Port of Rotterdam, is Europe’s largest importer of fossil fuels by sea. As Europe accelerates its green transition, companies reliant on transporting fossil fuels could face stranded assets. Importing fossil fuels keeps European shipping emissions high, highlighting the urgency of decarbonizing the energy supply.

The record emissions in 2024 show that operational pressures and fossil fuel transport are driving up EU shipping emissions. While trade volumes remain flat, the sector’s carbon footprint continues to grow.

Addressing emissions requires policies that target operational practices, support cleaner fuels, and reduce reliance on fossil fuels, ensuring sustainable shipping without disrupting trade.",https://safety4sea.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/shutterstock_1417504217-e1762511721414.jpg,N,,2025-11-07 09:00:56.745035

The shipping sector, long reliant on heavy fuel oil, is at the crossroads of transformation as major maritime nations convene in London to debate regulations that could drive the industry away from fossil fuels. The central goal is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through new, potentially groundbreaking measures that introduce the first-ever global fee on emissions related to climate change from shipping activities.

The Stakes and Scope of Proposed Regulations

The discussions held at the International Maritime Organization (IMO) headquarters focus on an ambitious “Net-Zero Framework,” designed to progressively lower the allowable greenhouse gas emissions from cargo vessels worldwide. Currently, shipping accounts for roughly 3% of global emissions, a figure on the rise due to expanding trade and continued use of fossil-based fuels.

The framework involves a pricing scheme targeting emissions: ships emitting greenhouse gases above a set baseline must pay fees or buy emissions credits. Penalties can reach as steep as $100 per ton of carbon dioxide equivalent for those failing to meet strict requirements. Conversely, ships that produce less pollution than mandated can earn surplus credits and even performance rewards.

How the Pricing System Works

Emission Level Implication Financial Impact Above Direct Compliance Target Must purchase emissions credits or pay penalty $100 per ton of CO2 equivalent Meets Baseline Compliance but not Direct Target Subject to penalties Varies based on excess emissions Below Direct Compliance Target Eligible for surplus credits and rewards Potential financial incentives

Driving the Industry Towards Net-Zero

The IMO has set an ambitious goal for shipping to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by around 2050. To meet this challenge, the industry is encouraged to switch to zero or near-zero emission fuels such as green ammonia, green methanol, and other sustainable alternatives. Carbon capture technologies, advances in electricity use, enhanced wind propulsion, and improvements in energy efficiency are also on the table as complementary approaches to curb emissions.

Given the typical lifespan of large ships—about 25 years—the clock is ticking for investments in cleaner technologies and new vessels capable of meeting these stringent regulations. Starting in 2027, penalties for emissions from large ocean-going vessels over 5,000 gross tonnage, which contribute to 85% of international shipping’s emissions, will come into effect.

Challenges Around Alternative Fuels

Although biofuels currently appear as a cost-effective compliance option, their sustainability is debated due to the large agricultural demand, which could displace food crops and even cause deforestation. Environmental groups urge the IMO to prioritize scalable green alternatives rather than biofuels made from food crops.

Green ammonia and methanol hold promise for the later decades of this century, likely becoming competitively priced and key players in the green transition of maritime transport.

Global Consensus and Dissent

The April 2024 meeting saw a near-agreement on the regulatory framework, though some countries voiced reservations, highlighting the complexity of achieving global consensus. The United States, Saudi Arabia, and Russia have expressed concerns, particularly about the economic impacts and regulatory details.

Despite these hurdles, environmental advocates emphasize the momentum behind the move for decarbonization, warning that failure to adopt these regulations promptly would delay critical progress, prolonging excessive emissions and associated environmental harm.

Economic and Environmental Benefits of Early Action

Advancement of climate action: Legally binding measures set a precedent for global environmental responsibility.

Improved public health: Reduced air pollution from ships benefits coastal and port cities.

Marine conservation: Lower emissions help preserve ocean ecosystems affected by climate change.

Financial incentives: Revenue from emissions fees is earmarked for sustainable fuel research and support for developing nations transitioning their fleets.

Implications for Logistics and Cargo Transport

This shift in maritime regulations affects global supply chain logistics by pushing fleets toward greener technologies and diesel alternatives, impacting freight costs and schedules. While transitioning may increase operational expenses initially, it promises long-term savings and efficiency gains through fuel economy and adherence to international standards.

For cargo movers, freight forwarders, and logistics planners, embracing these new guidelines early can result in enhanced reliability and compliance while contributing to environmental stewardship.

The IMO Net-Zero Framework has been described as a “momentous achievement” – and in many ways it is.","The International Maritime Organisation convened this October 2025 to vote on a framework that could reshape global shipping and redefine climate justice.

The IMO Net-Zero Framework, agreed upon this past April at MEPC 83, the Marine Environmental Protection Committee, represents the first legally binding global regulation to decarbonise international shipping, a sector responsible for emissions equivalent to those of major economies like Japan or Germany.

Yet, as this historic moment approaches, a critical question hangs in the balance: Will this framework deliver both the ambitious emissions reductions and the equitable transition that our planet and its most vulnerable communities desperately need?

The answer depends entirely on decisions to be made in the coming weeks and months.

Framework

The IMO Net-Zero Framework introduces an innovative two-tier system that sets increasingly stringent greenhouse gas intensity limits for ships while creating economic incentives through a carbon pricing mechanism.

Ships that fail to meet targets will incur penalties: US$100 per tonne for moderate non-compliance and a steep penalty of US$380 per tonne for those falling furthest behind.

These fees are expected to generate an estimated US$10-12 billion annually, flowing into a novel IMO Net-Zero Fund designed to support the transition.

On paper, this is groundbreaking. The framework will drive shipping toward zero-emission fuels, with modelling from University College London and UMass indicating that e-fuels (particularly green ammonia) will become the dominant solution by the mid-2040s.

Yet, here lies the framework’s central tension: while it will eventually drive the right technological outcomes, it may arrive too late for a smooth transition, risking that the world’s most vulnerable countries will bear disproportionate costs along the way.

The IMO’s own 2023 greenhouse gas strategy established two equally important objectives: reaching net-zero emissions by or around 2050 and achieving this through a “just and equitable transition”.

A United Nations Trade and Development analysis reveals that ship transport costs may increase by 80%, with broader maritime logistics costs (which would affect imports) potentially rising by 30%.

For Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and Least Developed Countries (LDCs), which already bear the brunt of climate impacts they did little to cause, these increases threaten food security, economic development and the basic quality of life.

The framework’s projected revenue of US$10-12 billion annually, while significant compared to other climate finance mechanisms, pales in comparison to the estimated trillion dollars of additional investment needed by 2050.

Every dollar must work extraordinarily hard to serve both decarbonisation and equity.

Beyond shipping

The IMO framework is more than a shipping policy.

It serves as a test case for global climate governance in sectors operating beyond national boundaries.

International shipping accounts for roughly 90% of global trade.

How we decarbonise it will shape economic development pathways for decades to come.

Moreover, shipping’s transition challenge mirrors that of other transport sectors but with unique complications.

A ship’s route is often unpredictable, following wherever cargo demands and therefore requiring fuel infrastructure in numerous global locations.

This creates a chicken-and-egg problem: ship owners will not invest in new fuel technologies without infrastructure, and infrastructure will not materialise without demand.

The solution requires parallel progress on supply and demand.

Countries with potential for renewable energy production (including many in Africa) could become major green fuel producers, but they face higher costs of capital and infrastructure deficits.

Strategic deployment of Net-Zero Fund resources could help build this infrastructure while creating economic opportunities in regions that have historically been excluded from the benefits of the energy transition.

What adoption must deliver

When IMO member states gather in October, they must adopt a framework that explicitly commits to resolving these tensions.

The adoption process should:

Affirm the dual mandate: clearly restate that just and equitable transition is coequal with emissions reduction, not subordinate to it.

Establish guardrails for guidelines: Provide clear direction that reward mechanisms must preserve adequate resources for supporting vulnerable countries, that distribution boundaries must be interpreted to address shipping’s full climate impact, and that credit trading must include safeguards against perpetuating inequity.

Commit to transparent, inclusive guideline development: The negotiations that begin immediately after adoption must meaningfully include the voices of SIDS, LDCs and civil society organisations representing vulnerable communities, not just industry and major maritime nations.

Set review mechanisms that maintain ambition: Ensure that the 2032 revision of targets for 2036-2040 incorporates both updated climate science and assessments of progress toward a just transition.

Reflection

The transition away from fossil fuels in shipping is inevitable. The only question is whether it will be orderly or chaotic, equitable or exploitative, a model for climate cooperation or another instance of the powerful protecting their interests while externalising costs onto the vulnerable.

The close of the extraordinary session of the MEPC demonstrated that the IMO has, sadly, become vulnerable to political capture.

The Net-Zero Framework, which had been approved by 64 countries in April with only 16 opposed, was deferred for one year despite having clear majority support.

The process was reportedly bent to the will of certain influential actors through threats and intimidation, rather than genuine consensus-building.

The IMO Net-Zero Framework has been described as a “momentous achievement” – and in many ways it is. But achievements are measured by outcomes, not intentions. Without clear regulatory signals, the industry will continue to procrastinate on investments in zero-emission technologies.

The deferral creates regulatory uncertainty that could delay the transition by years, making it even more challenging to meet the 2030 and 2040 targets.

“Ensuring an international level playing field is essential for the competitiveness of European shipping.","The Commission published this morning the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan putting forward an action plan for investments in clean fuels.

European Shipowners welcome the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan as a good first step that identifies many gaps and shortcomings in the existing European policy and finance framework.

STIP clearly recognises the need for more investments in clean fuels for shipping and identifies possible next steps and concrete action points. It prioritises the production of clean fuels in Europe as a matter of urgency for the transition to net zero and for reducing energy dependencies.

“We’ve got ambitious climate targets but not the clean fuels we need for the energy transition. STIP is putting investments in clean fuels at the centre of the competitiveness agenda. These investments are necessary for retaining industrial capacity, for enhancing competitiveness, for reducing energy dependencies and for getting to net zero” said Sotiris Raptis, Secretary General of European Shipowners | ECSA.

European Shipowners welcome STIP’s suggestion to use national ETS revenues to support the uptake of clean fuels for shipping. The EUR 9 billion generated from the contribution of shipping to the EU ETS should be used to bridge the immense price gap with clean fuels that are on average four times more expensive than conventional fuels.

STIP correctly points out that clear requirements are missing for European suppliers to make clean fuels available in the market for shipping. As a first step towards the introduction of a binding mandate on fuel suppliers, European Shipowners welcome the commitment to further incentivise the uptake of clean fuels to meet the targets of the Renewable Energy Directive and the FuelEU Maritime.

“STIP takes a major first step towards the use of the national ETS revenues to make clean fuels for shipping available at a competitive price. National ETS revenues have contributed substantially to the scale-up of renewables in Europe. We need to see the same happening for shipping. The use of the ETS revenues should also be matched by a binding mandate on European suppliers to make clean fuels available for shipping” Raptis added.

European Shipowners firmly support reducing administrative burden, especially for SMEs which are the backbone of European shipping. Therefore, European Shipowners welcome the commitment of the Commission to assess the burdensome reporting requirements for shipping companies and simplify rules.

However, the EU should go a step further and send a clear message on the full alignment of EU climate legislation with the IMO international measures, when adopted.

The concept vessel, to be developed by China State Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC) in partnership with the China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC), will feature a next-generation reactor designed to deliver zero-emission propulsion with extended operational endurance. According to early design reports from Shanghai Merchant Ship Design & Research Institute (SDARI), the ship will operate without the need for conventional bunker fuels, relying entirely on a closed-loop thorium MSR system expected to generate several hundred megawatts of thermal energy.

Project sources suggest the design phase will be completed in 2026, with construction potentially commencing towards the end of this decade at a CSSC-affiliated yard. If realised, it could become the world’s first container vessel powered by thorium molten salt technology—a breakthrough long championed by Chinese nuclear engineers for its safety, efficiency, and scalability advantages over traditional uranium reactors.

Chinese authorities have reportedly greenlit preliminary safety assessments for the project, though international regulatory hurdles remain significant. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has yet to finalise specific frameworks for the operation of nuclear-powered merchant vessels.

State-run Jiangnan Shipyard unveiled a design for a 24,000 teu ship incorporating molten salt reactor technology (pictured) at the last edition of the Marintec China exhibition two years ago, a show due to return next month.

The original 24,000-TEU box ship design has become smaller, at 14,000 TEU, according to the latest reports from the Chinese press.

English-language paper the South China Morning Post noted, “What makes this ship truly groundbreaking is that it will be powered by a thorium-based molten salt reactor (MSR) with a thermal output of 200 MW – matching the power level of the S6W pressurised water reactor used in the US Navy’s most advanced Seawolf-class nuclear attack submarines.”

Thorium, an abundant, naturally occurring metal is a clean, efficient fuel with extraordinary energy density. One tonne of it produces the same energy as 3.5M tonnes of coal. Its byproducts are significantly safer than uranium (in that plutonium is not produced under fission) and, with shorter half-lives, degrade far faster. It does not need to be enriched and is not difficult to access. It is also a completely zero-emissions fuel, and reports have shown that China has large reserves of thorium.

“The ultra-large nuclear container ship is designed to truly achieve zero emissions during the ship’s operating cycle,” China State Shipbuilding Corp said on Weibo, back in 2023 when the project was first announced.

Proponents of MSRs say the reactors are safe, efficient and operationally proven solutions. They work by dissolving thorium in liquid salt. The ensuing chain reaction heats the salt, producing steam to drive a turbine and create electricity. Although developments of MSRs on land are well documented, its potential for delivering clean maritime power is still untested in real-world scenarios.

Speaking about the suitability of thorium MSRs as an energy source for maritime applications, Norwegian University of Science and Technology professor Jan Emblemsvåg, an expert in the field of thorium and nuclear power generation, noted, “MSRs have enormous potential for enabling clean shipping. There is so much uncertainty over future fuels, but here we have an abundant energy source that, with the right approach, can be safe, much more efficient, cheaper, and with a smaller environmental footprint than any existing alternative. From my perspective I see this as the most viable, and potentially the only credible solution for a zero-emissions fleet that can operate under commercial terms and cost levels.""",https://dvzpv6x5302g1.cloudfront.net/AcuCustom/Sitename/DAM/156/maritime-china-weibo_Main.png,N,,2025-11-06 20:56:15.888895

Carriers and shippers must prepare for overlapping compliance obligations that will fundamentally reshape maritime operations, say the authors of a report from emissions tracking firm, VesselBot, titled ""Decoding Maritime Emissions, Q3 2025: Containership Emissions and Traffic on the Rise.""

The study analysed 73,353 containership voyages completed by 4,750 vessels between July and September 2025, examining maritime performance across multiple dimensions — vessel size, age, shipbuilding origin, and specific trade.

Key findings include that there is stabilization in emission despite traffic growth. Total containership emissions reached 50.3 million tons in Q3 2025, remaining virtually unchanged (-0.2%) compared to Q3 2024 despite a 2.3% increase in voyages. Average well-to-wake emissions intensity improved to 195.9 g CO2e/TEU km, down 1.6% year-over-year, driven by longer steaming times and reduced port dwell times.

However, well-to-wake emissions intensity varies dramatically by vessel size, from 252.1 g CO2e/TEU km for Feeder vessels (up to 2,999 TEU capacity) to 61.4 for Very Large Container Ships (at least 17,000 TEU capacity). Feeder vessels completed 62.1% of all Q3 voyages yet accounted for only 10.3% of total TEU km, while VLCS completed just 2% of voyages, accounting for 17.2% of total TEU km, which reflects their significantly higher efficiency levels.

Further, analysis of route-specific performance variations demonstrates the importance of route-level analysis, with Asia-Northern Europe voyages averaging an intensity of 55.3 g CO2e/TEU km and a duration of 30.6 days. In contrast, industry-wide average steaming time was only 3.5 days, highlighting how aggregate metrics obscure critical operational differences.

Komodromos, CEO & Founder of VesselBot.

“Every fraction of a degree means more hunger, displacement, and loss – especially for those least responsible,” Antonio Guterres told delegates. “Failure to contain global heating amounts to moral failure and deadly negligence.”

1.5°C Goal Under Threat

Guterres cautioned that humanity is on course to temporarily exceed the 1.5-degree threshold by the early 2030s, citing decades of denial and inaction. “Even a temporary overshoot will unleash far greater destruction and costs for every nation,” he said, calling for a “fundamental paradigm shift” to limit the overshoot’s magnitude and duration.

Warming Trends at Record Levels

The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) confirmed that greenhouse gas concentrations have reached their highest levels in 800,000 years. WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo reported that from January to August 2025, the Earth’s average temperature was 1.42 degrees above pre-industrial levels, with ocean temperatures also hitting record highs.

Climate Impacts Accelerating

The WMO report details a cascade of worsening climate impacts. Arctic sea ice hit a record low for winter coverage, while Antarctic sea ice remained well below average. Global sea levels are rising nearly twice as fast as in the 1990s, driven by ocean heating and ice melt.

Extreme weather events – from deadly floods and hurricanes to prolonged heatwaves and wildfires – continue to disrupt food systems, displace communities, and strain economies, particularly in developing nations.

‘A Red Line for Humanity’

Reaffirming the urgency of the moment, Guterres described the 1.5°C limit as “a red line for humanity.” He called on countries to accelerate emissions reductions, phase out fossil fuels, and strengthen protections for forests and oceans.

He noted that the clean energy transition is gaining momentum, with global renewable energy investments now exceeding those in fossil fuels by 800 billion dollars. “Clean energy is winning in price, performance, and potential – but what is still missing is political courage,” he said.

The IMO has delayed the Net-Zero Framework. The Red Sea crisis caused a 14% rise in 2024 shipping emissions as vessels rerouted around Africa. Carbon performance is beginning to improve, with carriers investing in LNG-powered vessels to reduce emissions and advance sustainability.

The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has announced that members have agreed to adjourn the extraordinary session of the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC), originally convened for 14-17 October 2025, to consider the adoption of draft amendments to MARPOL Annex VI, including the IMO Net-Zero Framework.

According to the latest IMO statement, the session will reconvene in 12 months’ time. In the interim, Member States will continue working toward building consensus on the proposed Net-Zero Framework.

Approved during MEPC 83 in April 2025, the IMO Net-Zero Framework is set to form a new Chapter 5 of the Draft Revised Annex VI of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL). The framework establishes a comprehensive regulatory package designed to align the shipping industry with the IMO’s 2023 Strategy on the Reduction of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions from Ships.

It consists of two core elements:

a global fuel standard

a global GHG emissions pricing mechanism

Progress Slows as Red Sea Crisis Drives Emissions Up

While discussions on the IMO Net-Zero Framework are set to resume next year, major ocean carriers have already made significant strides toward decarbonisation. However, geopolitical instability in the Red Sea has derailed some of this progress.

Global container shipping emissions rose by 14% in 2024, reaching 240.6 million tonnes of CO₂ and surpassing the previous record of 218.5 million tonnes in 2021.

According to Emily Stausbøll, Senior Analyst at Xeneta, this spike should not be viewed as a failure of the shipping industry. Instead, it reflects the operational impact of vessels rerouting around the Cape of Good Hope after the escalation of conflict in the Red Sea in December 2023.

“A new record high is the inevitable outcome of these diversions — both due to increased transport work and the surge in demand for laden containers in 2024, as shippers frontloaded imports in response to the Red Sea crisis,” Stausbøll explained.

Indeed, overall transport work — measured as tonnes of cargo multiplied by nautical miles sailed — rose by 18% in 2024.

Despite the ongoing crisis, recent data from Xeneta and Marine Benchmark suggest that ocean container shipping’s carbon performance is beginning to improve. The Carbon Emissions Index (CEI), which tracks emissions across Xeneta’s 13 major global trades, fell below 100 points for the first time in 12 months, registering 97.4 in Q2 2025.

This represents a 4.5% decline from Q1 2025 and a 7% drop from Q4 2024, when the index peaked at a record 104.8.

The Q2 2025 score marks two consecutive quarters of improvement, signalling a positive trend in emissions reduction. Although the index remains slightly above the 96 points recorded in Q2 2024, it is only 1.5% higher than the Q2 2023 level (95.9) — a period before the Red Sea conflict significantly disrupted trade routes.

This narrow gap, despite continued diversions around the Cape of Good Hope, indicates that a resolution to the conflict could yield a substantial decline in global maritime emissions, potentially pushing performance well below 2023 levels.

LNG-Powered Fleet Expansion Gains Momentum

One of the most significant developments in the pursuit of more environmentally friendly shipping is the increasing deployment of greener vessels across global trade routes. Major and niche ocean carriers alike are continually expanding and upgrading their dual-fuel LNG container-ship fleets to reduce emissions and advance sustainable maritime transport.

In a notable recent move, CMA CGM has signed a Letter of Intent for the construction of six new 1,700 TEU dual-fuel LNG-powered containerships to be built in India. With this agreement, the French shipping group becomes the first major international container carrier to commission LNG-powered vessels from Cochin Shipyard Ltd (CSL).

“The newbuilds demonstrate CMA CGM’s commitment to more sustainable shipping, as they can run on LNG and are ready for low-carbon fuels, significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions, aligning with the Group’s ambition to be Net Zero Carbon by 2050,” the Marseille-based carrier said in a statement.",https://webapi.czapp.com/api/v1/attachments/6e70dd63-c4fe-46f5-aa0b-354fb383aeb5.png,N,,2025-11-06 13:59:59.138425

""The STIP - underlined the Secretary General of the association, Sotiris Raptis - is investing in Clean fuels at the heart of the competitiveness agenda.
In addition, European Shipowners welcomed the proposal STIP to use the national revenues of the EU ETS, the Carbon Dioxide Emissions Trading System to support the adoption of clean fuels for maritime transport.
""The use of ETS revenues - specified Raptis - should also be accompanied by a binding mandate for European suppliers to make clean fuels available for maritime transport"".
'Ensuring a level playing field at the - Raptis underlined - is essential for the competitiveness of European maritime transport.","The European Shipowners' Association welcomed the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP) presented today by the European Commission ( of 5 November 2025). In particular, European Shipowners (ECSA) has noted that STIP boosts the uptake of fuels clean, is a good first step that identifies numerous Gaps and shortcomings in the current European political and financial framework clearly recognising the need for greater investments in clean fuels for maritime transport, and identifying possible next steps and concrete action points and, in addition, prioritizes the production of clean fuels in Europe as an urgent issue for the transition to net zero emissions and to reduce dependency Energy. ""The STIP - underlined the Secretary General of the association, Sotiris Raptis - is investing in Clean fuels at the heart of the competitiveness agenda. These investments are necessary to maintain capacity improve competitiveness, reduce the energy dependence and achieve net zero emissions"".

In addition, European Shipowners welcomed the proposal STIP to use the national revenues of the EU ETS, the Carbon Dioxide Emissions Trading System to support the adoption of clean fuels for maritime transport. In this regard, ECSA reiterated that the Nine billion euros generated by the contribution of transport ETS should be used to bridge the huge price gap with clean fuels, which - he recalled - are on average four times more expensive than fuels Conventional. ""The STIP - Raptis pointed out - makes a first An important step towards the use of national ETS revenues to make clean fuels available for maritime transport at a competitive price. The national revenues of the ETS have contributed substantially to the increase in energy renewable energy in Europe. We must see the same happen for the maritime transport'.

Observing then that the STIP correctly points out that there are no clear requirements for European suppliers on the implementation of availability of clean fuels on the transport market the European Shipowners' Association specified that it welcome the commitment to further incentivise the adoption of clean fuels to achieve the objectives of the Renewable Energy Directive and the FuelEU Maritime Programme as a first step towards the introduction of a binding mandate for fuel suppliers. ""The use of ETS revenues - specified Raptis - should also be accompanied by a binding mandate for European suppliers to make clean fuels available for maritime transport"".

Finally, ECSA pointed out that European shipowners support reduction of administrative burdens, in particular for SMEs that represent the backbone of maritime transport and therefore welcome the commitment of the European Commission to assess the onerous obligations of reporting for shipping companies and to simplify the rules. However, the EU should make a significant contribution to the further step forward and also send a clear message about the full alignment of EU climate legislation with measures once the UN agency has Taken. 'Ensuring a level playing field at the - Raptis underlined - is essential for the competitiveness of European maritime transport. We expect a clear message from the Commission that the EU will align its policy framework to international measures adopted at IMO level'.

Transport & Environment (T&E) has also welcomed the STIP plan which - noted the association, which aims to promote sustainable transport in Europe - contains promising measures to increase the production of e-fuel. For T&E, however, the EU will have to proceed quickly if it wants to maintain its industrial leadership in this technology. In the EU - explained the association - the projects for the production of e-fuels, in fact, have yet to materialize in due to the high costs and lack of supply agreements to long term.

Transport & Environment noted that if the commitment to establish an EU-wide bilateral auction of fuel for air and sea transport, based on an e-SAF pilot auction, will provide concrete resources to start production, however, this should be limited to e-fuels. In the short term - he T&E again noted - the STIP proposes to rely on the existing instruments - the Hydrogen Bank and the Fund for Innovation - which are starting to support the projects of e-fuel, including e-SAF. Although this sends a signal positive - observed the association - these tools alone have so far been unable to reduce the risks to production of e-fuels on an industrial scale. In T&E's view, therefore, the More effective measures than the plan could go too far delayed, as it is necessary to take initiatives for the e-fuel by 2026.

T&E also welcomed the intention of the European Commission to start preparations for the creation of a market intermediary to manage bilateral auctions, taking over that this tool is necessary to stimulate the nascent and to reconcile the needs of e-fuel manufacturers e-fuel in terms of long-term certainty with high-speed contracts used in the aviation and marketing sector shipping.

Noting that for the first time the EU will develop a effective financial instrument to boost the production of e-fuel, Antony Froggatt, Senior Director for Aviation, navigation and energy of T&E, highlighted that ""the EU must now follow up on these commitments if it is to contribute to Preserving European technological leadership in e-fuels. Leave The open door to biofuels - he said - will not make than weaken it."" The association has in fact reiterated its opposition to the use of biofuels for the decarbonisation of transport and expressed concern about the that the STIP plan leaves the door open to the inclusion of biofuels in bilateral auctions. ""Biofuels - warned T&E - are a more mature sector and could monopolize the limited resources of the market intermediary. It is It is essential - argued the association - that only e-fuels are eligible for auctions, as there are no barriers to market for the production of biofuels"".

He also noted that the STIP promotes the continued use of the biomethane in the shipping sector, T&E noted that limited stocks of biomethane should rather be considered for sectors that are currently dependent on fossil gas and which urgently need to reduce their dependence on such as domestic heating and heavy industry. ""This is particularly worrying - he said T&E detected - why ships currently only buy green certificates for biomethane, while the fuel is actually burned in domestic boilers and other sectors'.

Noting that the STIP plan is limited to encouraging Member States to use revenues from the ETS carbon market to decarbonising maritime transport and air transport, T&E highlighted the need for the revision of the ETS in the 2026 should consider the inclusion of a requirement to use ETS revenues for investments in e-fuel. In addition, the association complained that the STIP does not recognises the untapped potential for increased revenues from the ETS if carbon markets are expanded. Especially T&E estimated that last year there could have been raise more than seven billion euros by extending the ETS to all long-haul flights and found that around €2.4 billion per year of additional revenue could be generated between 2028 and 2035 including small transport ships.

Finally Transport & Environment complained that the STIP did not recommended the obligation to supply e-fuel for maritime use in ports European countries, which most EU countries do not yet have introduced despite the clear indications of the European directive renewable energy, and that the plan missed the opportunity to mobilise the European Investment Bank to invest in the production of e-fuels.

The other important initiative to accelerate the development of of high-speed rail in the EU presented today by the European Commission has been very well received by the ERC, the European association representing companies railway infrastructure managers and their national associations. ERC found that for the success of the European high-speed rail plan is It is essential to clearly define new infrastructures and strengthen them as this will not only ensure the ability to more commuter and freight services, but will improve even drastically the quality of existing services, making travel more comfortable, reliable and considerably more Quick.

In addition, ERC commended the Commission for approving standard speeds of 250 km/h or significantly higher for new high-speed lines, a benchmark that - underlined the association - guarantees that the transport rail can compete effectively with short air travel and attract traffic to the railway. The association has highlighted that this will also bring the same level of high-speed rail excellence across Europe and will maintain competitiveness with countries such as Japan and China.

""The real ambition of the current high-speed agreement - commented the Director General of the ERC, Alberto Mazzola - It is not just an investment in infrastructure, but a direct investment in quality and competitiveness of European travel. With a credible definition of infrastructure high-speed rail now specified, attention must be paid to the move on the speed of implementation. The ERC encourages Member States and the EU institutions to prioritise funding and coordination needed to develop European high-speed rail network and exploit its enormous advantages for all citizens"".",https://www.informare.it/IMAGES/facebook/inforMARErettangolare200x200.jpg,N,,2025-11-06 09:56:24.833275

Emissions in Q3 2025 were 4.2% higher than in Q1 2025 and 2.2% higher than in Q2 2025. However, relying on industry averages can be misleading, as vessels vary in size, characteristics, and routes. Achieving efficiency requires close monitoring of supply chain changes and disruptions.

The notable increase in emissions during the first quarter of 2025 is mainly due to vessel rerouting around the Cape of Good Hope. The changes in routing had not fully materialized by the end of Q1 2024. Therefore, the impact was very profound when comparing Q1 2024 and Q1 2025 emissions.

The average well-to-wake (WTW) intensity of the 73,353 voyages that were completed during Q3 2025 was 195.9, 1.6% reduced compared to Q3 2024. Intensity is mainly affected by the following factors:

Voyage duration – The higher the time spent steaming, the lower the intensity. In contrast, spending more time in port negatively impacts the intensity, as the vessel burns fuel without producing transport work.

Utilization – A metric that reflects the extent to which a vessel’s capacity is utilized. Efficient voyages have high utilization rates, as emissions are allocated to more containers.

TEU carried – Another metric that is typically examined, coupled with the utilization. The more TEU carried per voyage, the more efficient the voyage is. Therefore, larger vessels, while emitting more emissions, tend to be more efficient.

Distance – As distance increases, compared to the minimum feasible distance needed to complete a specific voyage, the intensity of the voyage increases as well. Subsequently, voyages with multiple port calls will have a higher intensity.

Speed – The speed a vessel cruises at during a voyage plays a vital role in fuel consumption. Speed is a complicated metric, with each vessel engine being designed with a specific optimal speed range. When a vessel cruises at speeds outside that range, fuel consumption increases, and so do emissions, negatively impacting the voyage’s intensity.

The factor of vessel age

Younger vessels tend to be more efficient, since their designs are up to date with the latest developments and their engines are younger. Therefore, it is worth exploring how voyage performance changes between different age groups. Voyages based on vessel age have been divided into these five categories:

• Vessels up to 5 years old

• Vessels between 6 and 10 years old

• Vessels between 11 and 15 years old

• Vessel between 16 and 20 years old

• Vessels older than 20 years old

It is observed that the distribution of vessels per age group does not differ substantially from that of voyages per age group. The most considerable divergence is recorded in the 11 to 15-year-old age group, where 19.3% of vessels, but only 16.3% of voyages, belong.

Once again, the influx of newly built vessels in the fleet is apparent: in Q3 2024, only 463 vessels were up to 5 years old, while in 2025 the number went up to 712.

Vessel speeds do not vary significantly between different age groups. The highest speeds are recorded in the age group of vessels up to 5 years old, where the average voyage speed reached 13.8 knots during Q3 2025, compared to 13.3 knots for all quarter voyages. The lowest average speeds were recorded in voyages completed by vessels that were more than 20 years old.

This is not surprising; older vessels turn to slow steaming to minimize fuel consumption. However, that does not make those voyages more efficient. On the contrary, those voyages recorded an average emissions intensity of 233.1, compared to 195.9 for all Q3 voyages.

Most efficient voyages were completed by vessels that were between 11 and 15 years old. Voyages completed by ships belonging to that age group recorded an average emissions intensity of 155.4, which is the lowest among age groups and slightly improved compared to the respective intensity in Q3 2024 (158.3).

Regarding the other characteristics of those voyages, the average steaming time plays a vital role, being equal to 4.4 days, compared to 3.5 days for all voyages completed during the third quarter. That duration is also the highest among all age groups. In each voyage, an average of 3,712 TEU was carried, while the utilization (ranging between 67% and 69% among all age groups) was 69",https://safety4sea.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/shutterstock_1972988039.jpg,N,,2025-11-06 08:16:34.102532

The Financial Times lays it all bare: to kill the net-zero shipping pact, Trump didn’t just lean on the usual diplomatic muscle—Washington went full gangster. Think raised port fees, outright bans on ships passing through America, and direct threats, and even personal intimidation of diplomats and their families, with entry bans waved in their faces like warning flags.

The Financial Times lays it out: over a dozen diplomats, foreign officials, and industry insiders watched the US throw diplomacy in the mud at last month’s London summit. Washington came armed with bullying tactics, determined to smash the net-zero shipping pact by brute force.

US Bullying Blocks IMO’s Green Shipping Deal—Vote Delayed a Year. IMO website image.

US officials didn’t bother with backroom deals—they stalked the halls, cornering diplomats from Africa, the Pacific, and the Caribbean. The message was simple: cross the United States, and your ships might not reach America. Rock the boat, and your family could be locked out. These weren’t idle whispers. The intimidation played out in broad daylight during coffee breaks.

Social Media Taunts, Policy Upends

Trump didn’t bother hiding his true feelings. On social media, he slammed the agreement as a “global green shipping tax scam.” But this wasn’t just venting. In April, most countries had already green-lit the framework. It was set to become real policy—until Trump’s team blew it up, forcing a one-year “pause.” The global momentum froze on the spot.

One diplomat cut to the heart of it: “It’s like the streets of New York.” His country got the warning firsthand—keep backing the deal, and watch your sailors’ visas disappear. US port fees? Those would rise too. Another attendee was even more blunt: IMO bigwigs were left gobsmacked. “It’s like dealing with the mafia,” they said. “You don’t need details. You just know: cross us, and you’ll pay.”

The US State Department kept mum on the intimidation claims. Instead, American officials handed out praise to Greece and Cyprus. Those two broke rank from the rest of the EU—they cast abstention votes in the big one-year adjournment, even after they already gave the framework the green light back in April.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio, ahead of the IMO meeting in London, issued a joint statement with senior Trump officials warning that the administration was ""evaluating sanctions on officials sponsoring activist-driven climate policies that would burden American consumers, among other measures under consideration."" As Greece and Cyprus sided with the U.S., much of Europe—and the world—reacted with surprise.

Global Rules or American Muscle?

Chatham House’s head of global economy Creon Butler didn’t mince words. The US, he said, has ditched long-standing diplomatic etiquette. Instead, Washington's now muscling countries into backing its stance—especially on climate.

America Threatens: Support This, Your Crews and Ports Pay.

“In the very short term this might work, but in the medium term it increases the chances that non-US countries will conclude they cannot work with the US, making agreements independently among themselves which simply work around the US,” he said. Sooner or later, the rest of the world will ink deals that leave America in the dust.

The pushback reached fever pitch at the IMO. Brazil, among others, called out the methods “that should not ever be used among sovereign nations”. Washington wasn’t just rattling individuals—entire capitals, from Bangladesh to Japan and Indonesia, got notes threatening diplomatic smackdowns.

But let’s step back. The drive for a net-zero shipping pact isn’t about feel-good climate slogans.

As Niu Tanqin from Xinhua puts it: The pact itself is a brass-tacks response to global warming’s mounting cost. Whether you like it or not, global warming is simply an undisputable fact. Everyone is scrambling to stall off the climate catastrophes looming on the horizon.

So, in order to squeeze carbon emission: if your ship emits less than the set limit, you’re rewarded. Above the cut-off, you pay. China, the EU, Japan, India, Brazil—all were in. Even the big shipping companies joined the chorus.

Only a handful of oil states—think Saudi Arabia, Russia, the UAE—pushed back. Pacific island nations, unconvinced the pact was tough enough, simply abstained.

Trump Says Global Warming’s a Scam—US Walks Out.

Then, everything changed. Once Trump 2.0 manifested, the US flipped from supporter to saboteur. In his mind, climate change is a hoax—or worse, a Chinese plot to corner American interests. Stopping this agreement wasn’t just policy—it was personal. He didn’t mind stooping low—pulling out every trick in the high school bully’s playbook: pressure, threats, and outright intimidation to make sure America got its way.

One official wasn’t shy: “It was completely exceptional. I have never heard of anything like this in the context of an IMO negotiation. These people [being threatened] are just bureaucrats, they are civil servants.”

If international law becomes a mere cheap disguise, you can bet real power will be the one pulling the strings.

Pause Button Pressed—World Left Reeling

Now, the deal waits on ice for another year, while “the world stares, shell-shocked”—witnesses to a new era of American brinkmanship.

Not the first time, either. Just look at tariffs: if Washington’s unhappy, it writes its own tax bill—no debate required. Venezuela and Nigeria have both fielded threats of military action; Canada and Panama know the taste of territorial intimidation. Lawless? That’s par for the course.

But payback, as always, has a funny way of coming due. Today, the US bullies island nations and slaps down climate claims. Tomorrow, who’s next? When “might makes right” replaces rules, every nation that depends on order will lose out. True justice may come late—but it never skips its date. Chip away at the pillars of fairness, and sooner or later, you bury the very house you live in.

The real question: how long can America’s strong-arm show go on before the world walks out?

Deep Throat

** The blog article is the sole responsibility of the author and does not represent the position of our company. **

CNN just laid out the evidence in four charts, which explained why China had the upper hand at the Busan summit.

On November 2, the network pulled official data from China's General Administration of Customs and the US Department of Agriculture to show exactly how Beijing outmaneuvered Washington in this trade standoff. By the time Chinese and US leaders sat down in Busan, South Korea, on October 30 to hammer out what observers are calling a one-year ""ceasefire,"" China had already shifted the playing board.

Xi and Trump face off in Busan—numbers speak first. AP Photo

The data confirms it—China followed through on its promises to reduce dependence on US markets, and American negotiators had to adjust accordingly.

US Market Share Shrinks

CNN's first chart tracks a stark shift: “The US now accounts for around 10% of Chinese exports, down from more than 15% a year ago.” The decline started before Trump's second term even began, then accelerated sharply in recent months. September's numbers tell the story—China's exports to the US hit $34.3 billion, down 27% from $47 billion the year prior.

The network's reporting confirms what trade watchers suspected: Beijing wasn't bluffing about pivoting away from US dependency.

Despite the US trade plunge, China's overall exports grew 6.1% this year, with September posting an 8.3% year-on-year jump. CNN's second chart makes the point visually—while US trade cratered, exports to the EU and ASEAN surged. China didn't just survive the trade war; it found new customers and expanded market share elsewhere.

The data shows China successfully executed its diversification strategy while US farmers and ranchers watched their market access evaporate.

The Soybean Shift

CNN's third and fourth charts zero in on two agricultural commodities that matter: soybeans and beef. The network notes that US soybeans have long been central to trade negotiations between Beijing and Washington. The September 2025 data marks a milestone—for the first time in years, China imported zero US soybeans that month. Not a single bushel.

Instead, Brazil and Argentina stepped in to fill the gap. Both South American countries saw continuous export growth to China throughout the period. When Argentina temporarily lifted soybean export taxes in September, China promptly purchased approximately 1.2 million tonnes from the country.

Chicago soybean futures—a benchmark for global prices—rose in the days before the Busan summit. After the leaders met, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced on Thursday, October 30, that China agreed to purchase 12 million tonnes of soybeans this season and committed to buying 25 million tonnes annually for the next three years.

Beef Exports Collapse

The beef numbers reveal an even more dramatic collapse. China ranks as the third-largest buyer of US beef, but purchases dropped like a stone in recent months. According to US Department of Agriculture data, China bought $481 million worth of US beef from January to July this year—just 8% of total US beef exports. That's a 47% decline from the same period last year, when Chinese purchases accounted for 15% of US exports.

September's figures are even starker. China's General Administration of Customs reported importing just $11 million worth of US beef last month—a 90% plunge from the $110 million imported in September last year. Australia and Argentina picked up the slack, increasing their beef shipments to China as US ranchers lost access.

These four charts provide a straightforward answer to why the side that initially escalated tensions—the US—eventually ""backed down"" and pursued constructive dialogue with China. The data shows Beijing meant what it said about diversifying trade partners and proved capable of executing that strategy.

Belt and Road Delivers

The Economist reported this month that China's ""thriving"" Belt and Road Initiative played a positive role in this round of US-China competition. The publication noted that the initiative promoted China's trade diversification on two fronts: Chinese component manufacturers expanded their export markets through factories established in Belt and Road countries, while those same countries developed their own industrial export capabilities—further strengthening China's resilience in global supply chains.",https://image.bastillepost.com/640x/wp-content/uploads/global/2025/11/FB-Image_Deep-Throat-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-06 08:16:40.184492

The NZF is a structural package that would reshape fuel use, reporting and the economic backbone of climate policy in shipping.","The decision at the recent Extraordinary Session of the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) at the International Maritime Organization (IMO) to postpone the adoption of the so-called Net Zero Framework (NZF) by a full year is not a sign of the industry dragging its feet – it is a reminder that political manoeuvring still trumps progress.

The NZF, designed to give legal force to IMO’s “net-zero by or around 2050” goal, was on track: in April 2025, 63 states voted for adoption in principle. By October, the vote was expected to turn that agreement into binding text. Instead, procedural disputes and geo-strategic posturing derailed the process.

The industry’s position has been consistent. Owners are ordering dual-fuel and methanol-ready tonnage, ports are building infrastructure for low-carbon fuels, and cargo interests increasingly treat decarbonisation as non-negotiable. What’s missing is regulatory certainty – and that’s exactly what the NZF was meant to deliver.

The plan would have introduced fees for non-compliance with tightening carbon-intensity targets, with compliant ships rewarded and surpluses tradable. Revenues could have reached up to US$15Bn annually by 2030.

But the path toward adoption veered off course. The trigger was a dispute over the procedural rules behind IMO law-making. Since 1973, amendments to the Marpol Convention – the core environmental treaty for shipping – have entered into force through ’tacit acceptance’, meaning they take effect automatically unless a threshold of objections is reached. During the October session, however, the United States – backed by Saudi Arabia and others – pushed for ’explicit acceptance,’ a far more cumbersome process that would require active ratification by each state and could delay or block the framework indefinitely.

As the week unfolded, procedural wrangling turned into geopolitical theatre. The US reportedly threatened tariffs, port access restrictions, or visa limits for officials from states backing the NZF. Under pressure, many large flag and tonnage states either abstained, changed their positions, or withdrew support. The motion to delay passed with 57 in favour, 49 against, and 21 abstentions.

That vote matters. The NZF is not a minor tweak to existing IMO rules but a far-reaching package that would redefine how ships use and report fuels while introducing an economic mechanism – effectively a global shipping climate fund. Without adoption, the original 2027 entry-into-force target is now uncertain, possibly slipping toward the next decade.

IMO has become a stage for competing agendas. The EU presses ahead with its Emissions Trading System and FuelEU Maritime – measures that accelerate regional action but undermine faith in global regulation. For developing nations and petro-states, Brussels’ unilateralism offers a convenient excuse: why agree to a global carbon price when Europe is already imposing its own?

Across the Atlantic, the US and Saudi Arabia have played their own part in the stalemate. Washington’s hesitation is increasingly driven by domestic politics, with a revived Trumpist narrative eroding support for climate multilateralism. That shift is already complicating the EU’s broader COP30 strategy – and it is seeping into IMO. Riyadh, meanwhile, continues to defend its petro-economic position by slowing any attempt to put a meaningful price on carbon.

Caught in the middle is shipping – the world’s most globalised industry, dependent on global rules, now watching those rules fragment. Regional carbon regimes and national carve-outs will not deliver decarbonisation; they will only create a two-tier system, with compliant fleets in wealthy jurisdictions and carbon-heavy fleets everywhere else. The NZF is a structural package that would reshape fuel use, reporting and the economic backbone of climate policy in shipping.

Scientists warn that expanding crop-based biofuels to sectors like shipping could undermine global net-zero goals, displace communities, and drive deforestation.
Despite being branded “green,” crop-based biofuels emit on average 16% more CO2 than fossil fuels once land use change impacts are included.","Transport & Environment (T&E) released an open letter signed by 100 scientists urging world leaders at COP30 to recognise the climate, social and environmental risks of an unchecked expansion of global biofuels demand.

The scientists call for governments and international bodies, including the International Maritime Organization (IMO), to focus on genuinely sustainable, scalable fuels rather than doubling down on crop-based biofuels.

The letter lands just as leaders gather in Belém for the COP30 summit, where Brazil is expected to launch a global pledge to quadruple the use of “sustainable fuels,” including doubling biofuel consumption.

At the IMO, Brazil – currently the second largest biofuels producer worldwide – has been promoting the use of biofuels as a way to decarbonize the shipping sector.

Global shipping is at risk of expanding into harmful biofuels, if unregulated. Both the IMO’s Net-Zero Framework (NZF) and the 2023 Revised GHG Strategy, which commits to full decarbonisation by 2050, currently lack any safeguards or sustainability criteria for biofuels.

This gap means that as the IMO works to define its net-zero pathway, crop-based biofuels could rapidly expand without any environmental or social protections in place. Scientists warn that this would undermine climate progress, worsen deforestation, and deepen global food insecurity the very impacts climate action seeks to avoid.

Biofuels have become a live issue at the IMO as countries define the fuels and technologies that will be part of the green future of shipping. As biofuels are cheap and largely available, they have been looked at by the shipping industry as an easy way to meet its decarbonization targets. But without sustainability criteria, according to experts, this pathway risks replicating the same environmental and food security crises already seen in the road and aviation sectors.

Scientists warn that expanding crop-based biofuels to sectors like shipping could undermine global net-zero goals, displace communities, and drive deforestation.

Already, growing crops for fuel uses 32 million hectares of land, an area about the size of Italy, to meet just 4% of transport fuel demand. By 2030, this could rise to 52 million hectares, roughly the size of France.

Despite being branded “green,” crop-based biofuels emit on average 16% more CO2 than fossil fuels once land use change impacts are included. These same crops – soy and palm oil, in particular – could otherwise feed up to 1.3 billion people. Today, about a fifth of the world’s vegetable oil supply is burned in cars instead of being used for food.

At last month’s IMO meetings (ISWG-GHG-20), member states remained divided on biofuels’ role in the maritime transition. Brazil, Indonesia and several African countries pushed for a “technology-neutral” approach that would allow food and feed-based biofuels to count toward emissions targets. The EU and Pacific Island states countered that this risks repeating the mistakes seen in road transport and aviation, arguing instead for a shift toward renewable e-fuels.

However, discussions have stalled: the US, Saudi Arabia and other oil-producing countries argued against further work on these sustainability safeguards until after the NZF’s adoption, despite previously citing the absence of such clarifications as a reason for delay.",,N,,2025-11-06 07:16:41.069275

This transformative partnership is designed to unlock massive investment in sustainable port infrastructure and accelerate the maritime sector’s just transition to net-zero.

The initiative establishes the first global framework specifically tailored to deploy Sustainability-Linked Loans for port decarbonisation projects worldwide. By combining C40’s network of nearly 100 cities and dozens of ports, IFC’s expertise in structuring climate finance transactions, and IAPH’s global alliance of 201 ports, the partnership will deliver comprehensive market guidance, capacity-building programmes, and direct access to finance for port authorities, particularly in the Global South where financing barriers have hindered green infrastructure deployment.

Maritime transport carries over 80% of global goods and accounts for roughly 3% of global CO₂ emissions. Ports, as nodes of global trade, require an estimated $1-2 trillion in cumulative investment through 2050 for shore power electrification, alternative fuel bunkering infrastructure, and zero-emission cargo-handling equipment. Yet approximately $200 billion in sustainability-linked capital remains untapped due to technical, financial, and regulatory barriers facing port authorities.

The C40-IFC-IAPH partnership directly addresses this climate finance gap through:

Standardised SLL frameworks that tie loan terms to ambitious sustainability KPIs, reducing transaction costs and improving investor confidence

Technical advisory support helping port authorities structure investment-ready projects and access to a global network of development banks and commercial lenders

Blended finance mechanisms combining concessional climate funds, development bank capital, and commercial investment to de-risk early-stage green technologies

Capacity-building programs including regional workshops and Port SLL Academies targeting Global South participants

The projected impact will drive C40’s efforts to:

Prepare more than 50 zero-emission port and shipping projects for investment by 2030

Mobilise resilient and sustainable maritime infrastructure finance for at least $1 billion within three years, leveraging IFC’s mobilisation capacity

Reduce maritime and port-related emissions in participating cities by 25-40% by 2035

Generate up to 4 million new jobs globally by 2050 through maritime decarbonisation, with significant concentration in Global South port cities

Support achievement of C40 cities’ commitment to drive creation of 50 million good, green jobs by 2030

Facilitate equitable access to competitive infrastructure financing for IAPH member ports in the Global South and Small Island States

The initiative builds on extensive groundwork including comprehensive market assessments and lender outreach to 30 commercial banks confirming strong support for standardised port SLL frameworks. The partnership formalises the Memorandum of Understanding signed between IFC and C40 in September 2024, moving beyond information-sharing to active co-leadership of sector-wide financial mobilisation.

The initiative will provide critical support for port authorities in the Global South, which handle more than half of seaborne exports and 60% of imports and face acute challenges including limited fiscal space, higher perceived investment risk, and weak credit ratings that drive up borrowing costs.

The partnership’s next steps include regional workshops and capacity-building programmes, commencing in 2026.

C40 Cities Managing Director of Climate Finance, Knowledge, and Partnerships Andrea Fernandez said, “Ports are gateways of international trade, and this global framework sets a new precedent, sending clear signals to the market and accelerating the pace and scale of climate finance for critical investments in zero-emission port infrastructure.

“This joint initiative delivers many wins: it de-risks commercial investments in port infrastructure and green fuels, it advances a just transition by enabling ports, particularly in the Global South, to address fiscal challenges, and also enhances technical assistance and capacity-building programmes.

“Crucially, the Global Port SLL initiative makes a compelling case to ramp up maritime decarbonisation and accelerate climate resilience, protecting the people and places we love.”

IAPH Managing Director Patrick Verhoeven said, “The Global Port Sustainability-Linked Loan initiative marks an important step forward for further collaboration between ports, loan providers, and regulators. These land-based investments can fund long-term infrastructure and support offtake agreements for low and zero-carbon shipping fuels and liquid bulk transport.

“Access to finance can equip ports with the necessary infrastructure to handle future low and zero-carbon energy molecules produced from renewable energy sources.

Ensuring an international level playing field is essential for the competitiveness of European shipping.
Targeted incentives for renewable fuels to bring production to scale.","The European Comission has unveiled its Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP) putting forward an action plan for investments in clean fuels and the energy transition.

Mobility and transport are vital to the EU’s industrial growth and competitiveness, however, the sector remains a major source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. To address this, the EU aims to reduce transport-related GHG emissions by 90% by 2050. Adopted on 5 November, the STIP focuses on promoting renewable and low-carbon fuels for aviation and maritime transport, aiming to mobilize investments and expand production of sustainable fuels.

European Shipowners have welcomed the plan as a first step that identifies many gaps and shortcomings in the existing European policy and finance framework. As stated, STIP recognises the need for more investments in clean fuels for shipping and identifies possible next steps and concrete action points.

We’ve got ambitious climate targets but not the clean fuels we need for the energy transition. STIP is putting investments in clean fuels at the centre of the competitiveness agenda. These investments are necessary for retaining industrial capacity, for enhancing competitiveness, for reducing energy dependencies and for getting to net zero.

…said Sotiris Raptis, Secretary General of European Shipowners | ECSA.

Moreover, European Shipowners support the STIP proposal to use national Emissions Trading System (ETS) revenues to promote clean fuel adoption in shipping. They emphasize that the €9 billion generated from shipping’s ETS contributions should help offset the high cost of clean fuels, which are about four times more expensive than conventional ones.

STIP also highlights the lack of clear requirements for European suppliers to make clean fuels available for the shipping sector. As an initial step toward establishing binding mandates for fuel suppliers, European Shipowners welcome the commitment to further incentivize clean fuel use in order to meet the targets of the Renewable Energy Directive and the FuelEU Maritime initiative.

However, the EU should go a step further and send a clear message on the full alignment of EU climate legislation with the IMO international measures, when adopted.

Ensuring an international level playing field is essential for the competitiveness of European shipping. We expect a clear message from the Commission that the EU will fully align its policy framework with international measures when adopted at IMO level.

…said Raptis.

In addition, the World Shipping Council (WSC) has welcomed the decision, highlighting it as a promising first step toward accelerating the energy transition in Europe for shipping.

WSC has called for the funding outlined in the STIP to focus on:

Price-bridging measures that make renewable fuels competitive, enabling their use by dual-fuel ships.

Targeted incentives for renewable fuels to bring production to scale.

De-risking market investment mechanisms connecting producers and buyers to de-risk investments and accelerate market development.

The plan sets out a framework for financing to unlock investments and scale up production of renewable and low-carbon fuels. Now the strategy must be taken forward in ways that deliver real impact on maritime decarbonization.

The 61 projects have the potential to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, cutting some 221 million tonnes of CO₂ equivalent over their first decade of operation. This is comparable to the annual emissions of 9.9 million average European cars and the reduction will directly support the EU’s objective of achieving climate neutrality by 2050.

Next steps

The developers of the 61 successful projects have been invited to start the grant agreement preparation phase with the European Climate, Infrastructure and Environment Executive Agency (CINEA).

During this phase, the Commission and the selected project promoters will finalise the funding contract confirming the budget, timetable, technical deliverables and legal responsibilities. The results of this process will be confirmed in the first half of 2026.

Today’s selection shows that Europe is turning its climate ambitions into industrial reality. The response to this call demonstrates the strength of our innovators and the determination of our companies to lead the global race for net-zero technologies. By investing in home-grown solutions, we are building energy resilience, creating quality jobs and ensuring that Europe remains competitive in the economy of tomorrow.

Secretary of State

Marco Antonio Rubio was born in May 1971 in Miami, Florida. His parents were Cubans who immigrated to the U.S. He attended Tarkio College in Missouri for a year on a football scholarship before enrolling at Santa Fe Community College in Gainesville, Florida. He later earned an undergraduate degree in political science from the University of Florida and received a Juris Doctor from the University of Miami School of Law. He interned with a member of the U.S. House of Representatives.

Rubio was elected to a seat as a city commissioner for West Miami before becoming a member of the Florida House of Representatives, where he served eight years, two as the Speaker. He was elected to the United States Senate, assuming office in January 2011.

Rubio was nominated by President-elect Donald Trump for Secretary of State prior to his inauguration in 2025. The Senate confirmed Rubio the day President Trump was sworn in and Rubio was sworn into office the following morning.

Rubio is married to Jeanette Dousdebes, and they have four children. He is a Catholic.

In the News…

Secretary of State Marco Rubio was joined by Transportation Secretary Duffy and Energy Secretary Chris Wright to explain why the United States voted “no” on the proposed United Nations global carbon tax. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) proposed the Net-Zero Framework (NFZ) to reduce “global carbon dioxide gas emissions from the international shipping sector.”

The U.S. secretaries stated, “President Trump has made it clear that the United States will not accept any international environmental agreement that unduly or unfairly burdens the United States or harms the interests of the American people.”

They continued, “The Administration unequivocally rejects this proposal before the IMO and will not tolerate any action that increases costs for our citizens, energy providers, shipping companies and their customers, or tourists. The economic impacts from this measure could be disastrous, with some estimates forecasting global shipping costs increasing as much as 10% or more.”

“The United States will be moving to levy these remedies against nations that sponsor this European-led neocolonial export of global climate regulations. We will fight hard to protect our economic interests by imposing costs on countries if they support the NZF.”

The U.S. then successfully garnered support to block the adoption of the NFZ in London. Another vote on the measure is anticipated next year.

Average well-to-wake emissions intensity improved to 195.9 g CO2e/TEU km, down 1.6% year-over-year, driven by longer steaming times and reduced port dwell times.

Direct China-U.S. voyages showed pronounced volatility, declining 3% in the first nine months of 2025 but spiking 15% in July before dropping 10% in September. China's retaliatory port fees targeting U.S.-owned, operated, or built vessels introduce additional complexity to carrier deployment strategies.

Chinese-built vessels completed 36% of Q3 voyages, while 53.1% of vessels under five years old have been built from Chinese shipyards. South Korean-built vessels carried out 24.6% of all Q3 containership voyages, but 41.3% of all VLCS. South Korean built vessels' voyages recorded the lowest emissions intensity at 152.7 g CO2e/TEU km due to larger capacities and long-haul trade deployment.

Well-to-wake emissions intensity varies dramatically by vessel size, from 252.1 g CO2e/TEU km for feeder vessels (up to 2,999 TEU capacity) to 61.4 for very large container ships (at least 17,000 TEU capacity). Feeder vessels completed 62.1% of all Q3 voyages yet accounted for only 10.3% of total TEU km, while very large container ships completed just 2% of voyages, accounting for 17.2% of total TEU km, which reflects their significantly higher efficiency levels.

Major fronthaul trades demonstrate the importance of route-level analysis, with Asia-Northern Europe voyages averaging an intensity of 55.3 g CO2e/TEU km and a duration of 30.6 days In contrast, industry-wide average steaming time was only 3.5 days, highlighting how aggregate metrics obscure critical operational differences.

Given the recent delay to the NZF and the framework’s weaknesses, it is up to individual countries and regional blocs to strengthen climate efforts

A recent extraordinary session of the International Maritime Organisation, which was meant to turn the tide on the global shipping sector’s poor climate performance, ended in acrimony. Instead of launching the IMO’s flagship Net-Zero Framework, pressure from the United States and oil-rich countries led, by a slim majority, to the 12-month postponement of the vote.

Although it was vital that the IMO pass the NZF, our latest study and briefing, released today (Thursday 6 November), reveal that the NZF is woefully inadequate to bring down the carbon footprint of the shipping sector.

Carried out by industrial economics professor Michele Cincera, our analysis projects that the NZF, had it been adopted, would have led to emissions cuts of only 8-10% compared with the 43% that would be necessary to bring the maritime sector in line with the Paris Agreement goal of limiting temperature rises to 1.5°C.

“Despite the procrastination at the IMO, governments need to face the reality of rising emissions from the shipping sector and support the transition to clean fuels and technologies,” says Jenny Helle, CMW’s expert on shipping decarbonisation and author of the policy briefing. “They should deploy all the tools in their arsenal to tackle the role of the shipping sector in fuelling the climate crisis. With the delays facing the IMO framework, the climate cost is bound to rise.”

Regional rescue mission

In light of both this delay and the low ambition of the Net-Zero Framework, our forthcoming briefing recommends that IMO member states strengthen the NZF in the meantime so as to make up for lost time.

We also recommend that national governments and regional blocs salvage the lost momentum by launching or shoring up their own measures to cut shipping pollution, such as by introducing a shipping component to their cap-and-trade carbon markets or expanding its coverage. For example, the EU can enlarge its Emissions Trading System to cover 100% of emissions from ships entering and leaving the European Economic Area, instead of the current 50%.",https://carbonmarketwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/theo-eilertsen-photography-9bOHP92SPck-unsplash.jpg,N,,2025-11-05 18:56:16.950106

In 2023, Asyad Drydock launched a floating dock capable of servicing vessels ranging from 50,000 to 80,000 DWT, a size that constitutes a significant portion of global maritime traffic.
Dr. Al Rabbani emphasized, “Asyad Drydock is the second-largest facility of its kind in the Middle East and North Africa.
Asyad Drydock specializes in the installation of exhaust gas scrubbers to eliminate sulfur oxides and other pollutants from ship emissions.","MUSCAT, NOVEMBER 5 — Asyad Drydock, a subsidiary of Asyad Group—Oman’s integrated global logistics provider—announced plans to invest in a second floating dock. This initiative is part of its strategy to enhance the capacity for maintenance and repair of small to mid-size vessels at its state-of-the-art facility in the Port of Duqm.

Dr. Abdulsalam Omar al Rabbani, Chief Operating Officer of Asyad Drydock, stated that the new floating dock will surpass the current Panamax-size facility, which was acquired and initiated at Al Duqm two years ago.

At the recent Duqm Economic Forum 2025, held in the Special Economic Zone, Dr. Al Rabbani highlighted that this new facility is part of annual investments averaging RO 4–5 million. These funds are dedicated to modernizing, expanding, and optimizing the yard’s capabilities to manage all types of maritime vessels and crafts requiring drydocking and repair services in Duqm.

In 2023, Asyad Drydock launched a floating dock capable of servicing vessels ranging from 50,000 to 80,000 DWT, a size that constitutes a significant portion of global maritime traffic. This addition has increased the yard’s overall capacity by approximately 20%, allowing the facility to accommodate around 40 more ships annually, raising its total repair capacity to about 240 vessels each year.

Dr. Al Rabbani emphasized, “Asyad Drydock is the second-largest facility of its kind in the Middle East and North Africa. In addition to our capacity for handling some of the world’s largest ships, we provide a comprehensive range of ship repairs, onboard fabrication, and related services. Our annual capital expenditure of around RO 4–5 million bolsters our technical capabilities and boosts overall efficiency.”

The yard is also focusing on environmentally sustainable practices to align with international environmental standards and Net Zero objectives. Asyad Drydock specializes in the installation of exhaust gas scrubbers to eliminate sulfur oxides and other pollutants from ship emissions. Additionally, it implements ballast water management systems that comply with IMO regulations, and employs robotic blasting and painting technologies to reduce the environmental impact of repair operations.

“By committing to these initiatives, we ensure that repair work is performed safely while maintaining superior quality and craftsmanship—essential elements that enhance customer satisfaction, loyalty, and competitiveness in pricing,” he added.

Kaushal said HPCL’s strategy over the next 5 to 10 years and beyond is closely aligned with India’s growth targets, as the nation progresses toward becoming a $5 trillion economy and ultimately achieving developed nation status by 2047.
The complex is jointly built by HPCL and the Rajasthan government, with equity stakes of 74% and 26%, respectively.
“Every time we go to the crude oil market, we see there is an adequate supply,” Kaushal said.
That is, lowering our own footprint to reduce emission intensity, while enabling customers in transition,” Kaushal said.","India’s oil demand growth is expected to remain strong over the next couple of decades, fueled by robust consumption of oil products such as gasoline and LPG, and sustained by resilient economic growth, according to Vikas Kaushal, chairman and managing director of state-run Hindustan Petroleum Corp.

“I expect overall demand to remain strong for the rest of this year and next year as oil demand is related to core economic activity, and economic growth is showing a lot of resilience,” Kaushal told Platts, part of S&P Global Commodity Insights, on the sidelines of the annual Abu Dhabi International Petroleum Exhibition and Conference, or ADIPEC 2025, on Nov. 5.

India’s refined oil products demand is projected to increase by 78,000 b/d year over year in 2025, with growth in 2026 expected to reach nearly 218,000 b/d, bringing total demand to about 5.65 million b/d, according to S&P Global Commodity Insights.

“Diesel demand growth had been somewhat muted due to seasonal factors, but we are positive about the overall outlook,” Kaushal said.

S&P Global Market Intelligence forecasts India’s real gross domestic product to expand by 6.3% in fiscal year 2025-26 (April-March), driven by strong consumption, rationalization of goods and services tax rates and moderating inflation, despite global policy uncertainty. It projects India’s real GDP growth of 6.2% in FY 2026-27.

Kaushal said HPCL’s strategy over the next 5 to 10 years and beyond is closely aligned with India’s growth targets, as the nation progresses toward becoming a $5 trillion economy and ultimately achieving developed nation status by 2047.

“Over the next decade, we see our role not just as a supplier of energy but as a key enabler of India’s economic and social transformation,” Kaushal said. “Our vision at HPCL is to be a trusted, future-ready integrated energy company that supports India’s growth story, while enabling its decarbonization and transition pathways.”

HPCL’s broad vision rests on three pillars: ensuring energy security and access; readiness for the energy transition and a focus on sustainability; and emphasis on innovation, technology and digital leadership, according to Kaushal.

Refinery expansion

HPCL’s two refineries at Mumbai and Visakhapatnam processed a record 6.57 million mt in the July-September quarter, up 4.3% year over year, the company said in a regulatory filing Oct. 29. Total imported crude volumes were 5 million mt, or 396,739 b/d, during the second quarter of the financial year.

Kaushal said HPCL’s overall refining capacity — including joint venture refineries — is set to rise to 45 million mt/year from the current 36 million mt/year, following the completion of the HPCL Rajasthan Refinery Ltd. project.

The complex is jointly built by HPCL and the Rajasthan government, with equity stakes of 74% and 26%, respectively.

“We are on track to complete the project and aiming for crude cut-in over the next few months,” Kaushal said.

HPCL is transitioning to a crude sourcing model that optimizes both term and spot contracts, as upgrades and expansions in refinery technology enable the processing of a broader range of feedstocks, allowing the company to capitalize on abundant market supplies, he said.

“Every time we go to the crude oil market, we see there is an adequate supply,” Kaushal said. “We are having a lot of interactions with oil suppliers here at ADIPEC. The question is about finding the right price and the right grade — heavy or light — depending on the need for our oil products output.”

“In the long run, crude supplies will depend on how much upstream investments are taking place, but in the short run, there is enough supply.”

Energy transition focus

Kaushal said India’s energy transition represents both a national imperative and a significant opportunity, and HPCL is dedicated to leading this transformation.

While ensuring the availability of affordable energy to support India’s rapid growth, he said HPCL is actively reshaping its portfolio to focus on cleaner, more sustainable fuels and low-carbon pathways.

“HPCL will be a pragmatic transition enabler — and have a two-fold approach. That is, lowering our own footprint to reduce emission intensity, while enabling customers in transition,” Kaushal said.

“We are executing a clear plan to net zero (scope 1 and scope 2) by 2040, with a finalized road map guiding investments in efficiency, renewables, green hydrogen, biofuels, and carbon capture and storage/carbon capture and utilization for hard-to-abate emissions.”

HPCL aims to reduce energy intensity and emissions at its refineries by enhancing efficiency, switching to alternative fuels, adopting renewables, utilizing low-carbon hydrogen, and minimizing flaring — initiatives that are anchored in its ambition to achieve net-zero emissions by 2040, Kaushal said.",,N,,2025-11-05 17:56:14.091070

The EU measures under this plan are expected to mobilise at least €2.9 billion until the end of 2027.
Commissioner for Sustainable Transport and Tourism, Apostolos Tzitzikostas, stated: ""Our Sustainable Transport Investment Plan is a decisive step towards a sustainable future.
European Shipowners firmly support reducing administrative burden, especially for SMEs which are the backbone of European shipping.
“Ensuring an international level playing field is essential for the competitiveness of European shipping.","The European Commission has adopted its communication on the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP), setting out a roadmap to rapidly accelerate the energy transition of aviation and waterborne transport sectors.

To meet the fuel targets set out in the ReFuelEU Aviation and FuelEU Maritime Regulations, a significant volume of around 20 million tonnes of sustainable alternative fuels (13.2 Mt of biofuels and 6.8 Mt of e-fuels) will be needed by 2035. This calls for substantial investments from the market, with an estimated €100 billion required by 2035 to drive production.

Regulatory stability is key for attracting investments into renewable and low-carbon fuels. With the STIP, the Commission sends a clear signal to investors that its targets are stable, and that it will support the sector throughout the transition.

The Commission says: By accelerating the production of EU-made sustainable fuels, Europe can significantly boost its competitiveness, reduce its energy dependency on fossil fuels and lead this industrial transition, on the way to reaching climate neutrality by 2050. Europe is already a global leader and holds most of the know-how and industrial leadership in this sector.

The EU measures under this plan are expected to mobilise at least €2.9 billion until the end of 2027.

The Commission will propose €300 million by end of this year to support the production of hydrogen for sustainable aviation (SAF) and maritime (SMF) fuels through the European Hydrogen Bank.

The Commission will support R&I projects with around €133 million under Horizon Europe.

The Commission will mobilise €153 million for synthetic aviation fuel projects and €293 million for maritime fuel projects under the Innovation Fund.

In the medium-term, the EU needs an intermediary mechanism connecting fuel producers and buyers to provide revenue certainty and de-risk investments. The Commission will work towards establishing such a mechanism.

Commissioner for Sustainable Transport and Tourism, Apostolos Tzitzikostas, stated: ""Our Sustainable Transport Investment Plan is a decisive step towards a sustainable future. It’s not just about cutting emissions – it’s about building a stronger, more competitive and resilient Europe that leads in sustainable transport. This ambitious plan shows the Commission’s firm commitment to scaling up renewable and low-carbon fuels in aviation and waterborne transport. Success will depend on close cooperation among Member States, industry, financiers and civil society to turn this challenge into a strategic opportunity for Europe.""

ECSA responds

European Shipowners welcomed the STIP as a good first step.

“We’ve got ambitious climate targets but not the clean fuels we need for the energy transition. STIP is putting investments in clean fuels at the centre of the competitiveness agenda. These investments are necessary for retaining industrial capacity, for enhancing competitiveness, for reducing energy dependencies and for getting to net zero,” said Sotiris Raptis, Secretary General of European Shipowners | ECSA.

European Shipowners welcome STIP’s suggestion to use national ETS revenues to support the uptake of clean fuels for shipping. The EUR 9 billion generated from the contribution of shipping to the EU ETS should be used to bridge the immense price gap with clean fuels that are on average four times more expensive than conventional fuels.

“STIP takes a major first step towards the use of the national ETS revenues to make clean fuels for shipping available at a competitive price. National ETS revenues have contributed substantially to the scale-up of renewables in Europe. We need to see the same happening for shipping. The use of the ETS revenues should also be matched by a binding mandate on European suppliers to make clean fuels available for shipping” Raptis added.

European Shipowners firmly support reducing administrative burden, especially for SMEs which are the backbone of European shipping. Therefore, European Shipowners welcome the commitment of the Commission to assess the burdensome reporting requirements for shipping companies and simplify rules. However, the EU should go a step further and send a clear message on the full alignment of EU climate legislation with the IMO international measures, when adopted.

“Ensuring an international level playing field is essential for the competitiveness of European shipping. We expect a clear message from the Commission that the EU will fully align its policy framework with international measures when adopted at IMO level” said Raptis.

Danish shipowners respond

For Danish Shipping, the current lack of fuels must be addressed urgently.

“The EU is in imminent danger of being overtaken by China and other ambitious players when it comes to the production of the green fuels we need to power our ships. It is therefore very positive that the Commission has focused on this issue in the STIP. The Commission proposes several sensible action points and investments, and we look forward to seeing these move from strategy to reality,” said Anna Vejlby Ib, Head of Danish Shipping’s EU Representation.

Danish Shipping has previously proposed that part of the DKK 3.8 billion that Danish shipping alone is expected to contribute annually once the sector is fully included in the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) in 2026 should be earmarked to bridge the price gap between fossil and green fuels — both in production and consumption.

The organization says it is therefore encouraging that the European Commission is now urging Member States to allocate sufficient ETS revenues to the maritime and aviation sectors, including for the production of sustainable and low-emission fuels. The EU itself should follow suit and earmark ETS revenues for the green transition of shipping.

“The EU must focus on ensuring supply, price stability, and competitiveness when it comes to green fuels. The EU should, among other things, set common European targets for the production of green fuels. At Danish Shipping, we view positively the Commission’s proposal on de-risking long-term contracts and introducing two-sided auction mechanisms to reduce the price gap between fossil and green fuels. This is simply a prerequisite for implementing the EU’s own initiatives such as FuelEU Maritime and ReFuelEU Aviation, which aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,” said Ib.

Danish Shipping also strongly supports the Commission’s ambitions to strengthen cooperation with partner countries such as Morocco, Algeria, and Egypt — where there is abundant sun, wind, and robust energy infrastructure.

“It is positive that the Commission maintains its focus on com­petitiveness and the green transition at the same time — not least at a time where other forces are pulling in the opposite direction. Shipping is — and must remain — part of the solution. But that requires the EU to dare to invest massively in the green transition now. The world is not standing still — and neither must Europe,” said Ib.

World Shipping Council (WSC) responds

WSC says financial measures are key in EU's STIP implementation to make renewable fuels competitive.

“The European Commission’s publication today of the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP) is a promising first step toward accelerating the energy transition in Europe for shipping,” says Jim Corbett, WSC’s Environmental Director, Europe.

“The plan sets out a framework for financing to unlock investments and scale up production of renewable and low-carbon fuels. Now the strategy must be taken forward in ways that deliver real impact on maritime decarbonization.”

World Shipping Council is eager to work with the Commission to ensure the STIP translates to concrete measures that bridge the cost gap between renewable marine fuels and conventional bunkers. Without this, production and uptake will stall despite significant fleet investments already made by the liner shipping sector.

WSC calls for the funding outlined in the STIP to focus on:

• Price-bridging measures that make renewable fuels competitive, enabling their use by dual-fuel ships.

• Targeted incentives for renewable fuels to bring production to scale.

• De-risking market investment mechanisms connecting producers and buyers to de-risk investments and accelerate market development.

These measures are essential to help unlock the estimated €100 billion investment needed by 2035 and to ensure that funds mobilized through InvestEU, the European Hydrogen Bank, and the Innovation Fund deliver maximum impact.

Demand for renewable maritime fuels is growing. WSC’s Dual-Fuel Fleet Dashboard shows the readiness of liner fleets, with over €150 billion invested in dual-fuel ships, ready to run on zero/near-zero fuels by 2030. These investments will only translate into GHG emissions reductions if renewable fuels become available at competitive prices.

While the STIP focuses on investment, Europe must not lose focus on additional measures critical for the transition:

• Fit-for-purpose certification of global fuel production to ensure environmental integrity and support early uptake.

• Strategic port infrastructure investments for green fuel bunkering and onshore power supply, to be outlined in the upcoming EU Port Strategy.

SASHA responds

Aurelia Leeuw, Director of EU Policy at the Skies and Seas Hydrogen-fuels Accelerator (SASHA) Coalition, said: “The Commission deserves credit for taking concrete steps to finance and de-risk e-fuel production – especially through the creation of a double-sided auctioning system that can finally bridge the price and contract gaps between fossil and e-fuels, which marks a real stride forward.

""But the STIP still falls short where ambition matters most. An extension of the ETS is still missing, and without it, we won’t generate the revenues needed to truly accelerate decarbonisation in aviation and maritime. And while it’s positive to see recognition of zero-emission aircraft and hydrogen’s role, support for zero-emission technologies across the board remains limited.",https://images.marinelink.com/images/maritime/w800/doganmesut-adobe-165213.jpeg,N,,2025-11-05 16:56:07.949838
