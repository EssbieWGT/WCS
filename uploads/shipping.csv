The proposal didn’t reflect that.” Harfjeld noted that Washington’s opposition underscored who ultimately bears the cost of decarbonisation.
“What was on the table two weeks ago was probably skewed to a particular sector within the industry,” he said.
We’ve overdone it.” Fiori also warned that the conversation has drifted too far from the physical realities of the oil trade.
We’re the most efficient transport mode.” Fiori agreed that shipping suffers from “a perception problem more than a reality problem.","If there was one word that dominated discussion at the tanker panel during this year’s Maritime CEO Forum at the Monaco Yacht Club, it was uncertainty — from the IMO’s fractured net-zero process to the unintended consequences of Western sanctions and the rise of the shadow fleet.

Moderator Tim Wilkins, managing director of INTERTANKO, set the tone from the outset. “We’ll talk about regulatory certainty and then political certainty — if we can find any,” he said, only half-jokingly. “Whether we can get regulatory certainty, I’m not sure. But that’s the challenge we’re all living through.”

The forum brought together senior figures from across the tanker spectrum — from VLCC operators to product carriers — for what became a strikingly frank exchange on the state of global regulation, market alignment and enforcement.

The IMO’s failed attempt earlier this month to finalise its Net Zero Framework was the natural starting point. The collapse of consensus, driven in part by a US rejection of carbon levies, loomed over every conversation.

Svein Moxnes Harfjeld, president and CEO of DHT Holdings, said bluntly that the proposals on the table “didn’t really look at the industry” as it exists today.“We all tend to talk about maritime as a homogeneous industry — and it’s not,” he said. “There are lots of different ships, trades, cargos, short haul, long haul, scheduled and tramp. The proposal didn’t reflect that.”

Harfjeld noted that Washington’s opposition underscored who ultimately bears the cost of decarbonisation. “The US has the world’s biggest economy, the world’s biggest oil company, huge agriculture. They said they didn’t want to tax their consumers. And that’s their argument — they don’t want to pay for what others want to do.”

Wilkins agreed that smaller owners had been underrepresented in the IMO debate. “What was on the table two weeks ago was probably skewed to a particular sector within the industry,” he said. “The IMO now needs to open its doors again to the wider voice — the practical realities of the tanker sector.”

Marco Fiori, CEO of Premuda, spoke passionately about the contradictions in global policy. “Everybody talks a great game and then plays a very poor one,” he said. “Governments say they want decarbonisation but then load bureaucracy and taxation on us. We’ve overdone it.”

Fiori also warned that the conversation has drifted too far from the physical realities of the oil trade. “We’ve been hearing for years that we’ve reached peak oil. Every time, there’s a new peak oil. We’re very far from peak oil. Conventional fuels will be with us for a long time — probably unfortunately.”

He added that inflation and rising costs make it nearly impossible to forecast newbuilding deliveries. “How can you predict what will deliver in 2028 or 2029 when inflation is unpredictable? We’re still facing the same shortage of shipyard capacity.”

Alexia Inglessis, director of Alberta Shipmanagement, steered the debate toward practical steps.“With alternative fuels still unavailable, we must focus on efficiency — which also makes business sense,” she said. “Over 40% of the world fleet already has energy-saving devices installed. But 70% of the fleet is still of average age or older.”

She cautioned that shipping will compete with food production for fuels like ammonia. “Eighty percent of ammonia today is used to fertilize crops. The growing population over the next 40 years will need more food than in the past 8,000 years. Shipping will have to compete for these resources.”

Inglessis reminded delegates that shipping’s emissions are modest compared to other sectors. “Shipping contributes about 2.4% of global CO₂ emissions — less than 2% of greenhouse gases. Compare that with steel or concrete, which each account for 8–9%. We’re the most efficient transport mode.”

Fiori agreed that shipping suffers from “a perception problem more than a reality problem. People see smoke from a funnel, so they assume we’re the worst offenders.”

Mikael Skov, CEO of Hafnia, described the IMO’s process as “driven more by feelings than by reason”.

“At the Global Maritime Forum I sensed real frustration,” he said. “People support the goal — we know it’s the right direction — but the process has felt imposed. Shipping isn’t one industry. Yet the framework was pushing everyone in the same direction, even those without alternatives.”He argued that the decarbonisation debate has drifted toward punishment over pragmatism. “Our clients won’t pay for dual-fuel ships. There’s no renewable alternative yet. But the framework still says: if you can’t comply, you pay a penalty. That penalty then goes to people developing renewables — while we’re left footing the bill.”

Skov nevertheless insisted that the IMO remains essential. “We need a global voice to regulate the industry. The problem isn’t a lack of regulation — it’s a lack of enforcement.”

That theme — enforcement — quickly turned to the proliferation of the shadow fleet.

Skov was blunt: “It’s a massive problem that flag states supporting the dark fleet are sitting at the IMO table making decisions about future regulation.”

Wilkins called for a clearer line between compliant operators and the murky world of sanctioned tonnage. “There are maybe 500 to 600 sanctioned vessels,” he said. “But if you listen to the numbers, there are 1,300 ships in the shadow fleet. What about those 800 grey-area tankers? They slip in and out of commercial trade. We need to draw a line.”

Fiori added that once sanctions lift, the industry faces another problem: “What do we do with those ships? They can’t be scrapped easily because yards have their own KYC requirements. We can’t just dump them somewhere.”

Harfjeld highlighted how lax oversight enables shadow trading. “Malaysia produces half a million barrels a day but exports one and a half million. Figure that out,” he said, drawing laughs. “Oil gets new birth certificates — Venezuelan crude sold as ‘Benin Heavy’, which doesn’t exist.”

Inglessis pointed out that legality depends on geography. “What’s illegal for the US, EU, or G7 might be entirely legal for China. We’re playing with two different sets of rules — and maritime centres are shifting east as a result.”As discussion deepened, panelists agreed that unilateral sanctions have unintentionally reshaped tanker trading.

“Let’s not forget it was the US that introduced sanctions,” said Harfjeld. “They wanted to keep oil flowing and prices stable. Strong economic interests were at play.”

Fiori called it “a game of equilibrium, but an increasingly unbalanced one.” He recalled how, at the start of Russian sanctions, “the US Treasury was quietly telling traders not to stop importing Russian oil, because it would crash supply and spike prices. It’s always politics first.”

Inglessis offered data showing that despite sanctions, exports are rising. “The three sanctioned producers are exporting more than before,” she said.

Looking ahead, Harfjeld forecasted a return of contango — the storage-driven market structure last seen in 2020. “Oil companies expect contango later this year,” he said. “China is already building inventories. It’s partly price-driven but also about energy security.”He expects the build-up to last well into next year, which “will be positive for tankers — though we might face a hangover once stocks unwind.”

By the end of the 50-minute session, the tanker leaders had circled back to Wilkins’s opening theme: a fragmented industry struggling for coherence.“We’re not one industry. There are several pathways to net zero, and the framework two weeks ago was tailored for just one,” Wilkins said.If there was consensus on anything, it was that tankers — pragmatic by nature — crave realism over rhetoric. “Focus on what’s doable,” said Harfjeld.",https://splash247.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Monaco-CEO-Tankers-2025.jpg,N,,2025-10-30 05:00:35.372575

Announced green ammonia projects have potential to locally and competitively supply the corridor’s fuel needs, and Saldanha could become the corridor’s long-term bunkering hub

Global and regional regulations may help create a business case for this corridor, although uncertainties around the development of regulations remain

Additional action is needed by private and public stakeholders to address the remaining risks and gaps to launch the corridor on time

30 October 2025, Johannesburg – Ammonia-fueled bulk carriers could feasibly be deployed on the South Africa-Europe iron ore trade route as soon as 2029 and scale toward full decarbonisation by 2035, according to the Global Maritime Forum.

The feasibility study, produced in collaboration with a consortium created in 2023 (which includes Anglo American, CMB.TECH, Freeport Saldanha, VUKA Marine, and ENGIE), said the corridor linking Saldanha Bay in the Western Cape to the Port of Rotterdam in the Netherlands would be one of the first Global South-to-North green shipping routes.

Saldanha Bay, home to South Africa’s primary iron-ore export terminal, is already planning the development of ammonia production, alongside port upgrades to handle bunkering operations.

In the green corridor’s initial years, ammonia-fueled vessels would likely bunker in Rotterdam, which is one of the most mature ports in terms of its ammonia bunkering and safety frameworks. Meanwhile, Saldanha Bay will have the opportunity to build the infrastructure to become the long-term green ammonia production and bunkering hub for the corridor.

By 2035, the port could supply bunkering services to all corridor vessels locally, creating a dual-purpose facility that continues mineral exports while serving international shipping.

“This phased approach gives shipowners and fuel producers a clear timeline to work toward, and we now need coordinated action from policymakers and industry to make this a reality by 2029,” said Shanon Neumann, Associate: Investment Facilitation at Freeport Saldanha. “However, to help Saldanha Bay transition quickly, blending public and private funding can unlock investment in infrastructure and reduce the risks of early projects.”

Why it matters for South Africa

The World Bank and World Economic Forum have both previously identified South Africa as a prospective key player in fueling shipping’s decarbonisation. The green corridor could contribute towards turning this notion into a reality.

Announced green hydrogen projects near the ports of Boegoebaai, Saldanha, and Walvis Bay could meet the corridor’s fuel needs, including its high-demand scenario of 22 bulk carriers per annum by 2035. The possibility of such strong demand levels could mean a stronger business case for green hydrogen producers looking to secure enough offtake volumes to finalise investment decisions and accelerate new projects.

Add in the necessary financing, potential tax incentives, and port tariff discounts for fuel production and bunkering build-out at Freeport Saldanha, and South Africa could gain a competitive edge as an international bunker supplier. The country’s hydrogen sector may be able to contribute 3.6% to the country’s GDP by 2030, with shipping and steel well-positioned to become early offtakers of the gas and its derivatives.

This green shipping corridor offers the opportunity to strengthen South Africa’s export competitiveness, future-proof a strategic port, and support the country’s Just Energy Transition through local value chains, skills development, and community benefits.

Policy alignment equals a strong business case

Regional and global regulations could materially improve the business case for the corridor. Europe’s FuelEU Maritime greenhouse-gas intensity targets and Emissions Trading System levy, the latter to be fully phased in by 2026, narrow the cost gap between green ammonia and conventional fuels by more than 60% in modelled scenarios.

The International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) Net-Zero Framework (NZF), now set to be revisited in 2026 following the decision earlier this month to delay adoption, would further strengthen the case, with fuel standards, emissions targets, and market-based incentives that reward zero-emission fuels.

“With binding global regulations delayed for now, there remains a business case to be made for green ammonia on this corridor,” says Marieke Beckmann, Global Maritime Forum deputy director of decarbonisation. ""The role of national and local governments becomes increasingly important in incentivising the adoption of scalable zero emission fuels. This, combined with EU measures, will help position South Africa as a competitive supplier of clean maritime fuel.""

Next step: implementation

The Global Maritime Forum study provides a roadmap to making the corridor operational by 2029, including:

Creating an enabling contracting environment to optimally and fairly allocate risks and rewards across the value chain.

Engaging with South African government bodies and industry stakeholders to raise awareness of the corridor opportunity and the need for an enabling policy environment, and build momentum around it.

Mobilising funding and incentives for corridor infrastructure that will contribute to Saldanha’s hydrogen hub and port development.

If implemented, the South Africa–Europe Iron Ore Green Corridor could become a model for an equitable, commercially viable zero-emission shipping corridor and a catalyst for South Africa’s hydrogen economy to unlock large-scale investment.

This report has been authored by the Global Maritime Forum and is based on a feasibility analysis conducted by the Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI) with input and validation from the consortium members.

Low greenhouse gas (GHG) fuels such as biodiesel and bio-liquefied natural gas (LNG) generate fewer carbon emissions than fossil fuels.
“Biofuels can range from only about a 50 percent reduction in well-to-wake emissions to close to net-zero emissions.
Challenges include minimizing additional energy consumption to achieve CO2 capture and ensuring the purity of the captured and liquefied CO2.
We have seen significant technical development and large-scale tests that could prove the CO2 reduction technology,” he said.","The global maritime transportation paradigm is shifting toward more eco-friendly methods that harness cleaner fuels and generate fewer carbon emissions. However, slow progress in fuel supply chains and the development of technologies for future ships is delaying this big-picture transition, according to an expert from a Norwegian industrial risk management provider.

Eirik Ovrum, principal consultant at DNV, said that although the testing of technologies to implement these fuels and deploy ships is not advancing at the necessary pace, the tests themselves are showing positive signs and the industry is on the right track.

One major upcoming category of future ships in the pipeline is those using biofuels. Low greenhouse gas (GHG) fuels such as biodiesel and bio-liquefied natural gas (LNG) generate fewer carbon emissions than fossil fuels. These fuels are currently in high demand worldwide, but their global supply remains limited, according to Ovrum, author of “Maritime Forecast to 2050,” a report published by DNV.

“Biofuels can range from only about a 50 percent reduction in well-to-wake emissions to close to net-zero emissions. The same is true for bio-LNG. So shipowners with access to the right kinds of biodiesel or bio-LNG can reach net-zero and avoid paying any carbon dioxide (CO2) price to the International Maritime Organization (IMO). We, however, see a lack of supply to meet demand. The production of low-GHG fuels has to be increased in order for shipping to meet the IMO goals in 2030, 2040 and net-zero by 2050,” he said in an interview with The Korea Times.

“We don’t know how far this will go. We aren’t certain about additional costs of collecting new types of biowaste. Both the speed at which production is expanding and possible increases in production costs are impacting our assessment of the future. And perhaps the most important aspect is what demand will be like from sectors other than shipping. And it seems unlikely that we will see a reduction in biodiesel use over the next 10 years.”

Onboard carbon capture systems (CCS), another anticipated technology, also remain in testing before full-scale deployment, according to Ovrum. Challenges include minimizing additional energy consumption to achieve CO2 capture and ensuring the purity of the captured and liquefied CO2.

“The level of impurities in the CO2 stream is a significant question in the wider CCS value chain,” he said.

Wind-assisted propulsion systems (WAPS), which do not require low-GHG fuels or CO2 capture, also need further development to determine a basis for practical use, Ovrum said. “We are working on verifying savings (of energy) for ships with the system installed, but the results are highly individual, and one ship’s savings are not necessarily applicable to another ship.”

Despite these challenges, Ovrum said that human ingenuity is overcoming hurdles through testing and proposals to current IMO regulations. For example, with the implementation of more flexible chain-of-custody models, like book-and-claim, access to biodiesel and bio-LNG will be easier and faster.

Ovrum also noted that dozens of full-scale CCS pilot projects are being tested on merchant ships in operation. Norwegian shipowner Solvang’s chemical tanker Clipper Eris has been testing an onboard CCS for more than six months. A similar system from the Shanghai Marine Diesel Engine Research Institute has been in operation since 2024 on the container vessel Ever Top.

“The results are encouraging. We have seen significant technical development and large-scale tests that could prove the CO2 reduction technology,” he said. “DNV is active in development of the wider CCS value chain, including shipping, and is currently running more than 10 joint industry projects addressing key industry challenges in capture, transportation, storage, dispersion and metering.”

As for WAPS, Ovrum said there are currently 50 ships with the “advanced sails” and another 100 coming up. He said WAPS “could be the most promising development.”",https://newsimg.koreatimes.co.kr/2025/10/29/9353816b-b396-4662-9dcc-d228fec490f3.jpeg,N,,2025-10-30 02:00:52.493808

Navigating Change with Care, Compliance and Collaboration

The recent IMO Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) meeting in London was a reminder of just how complex the global energy transition can be. The decision to delay the implementation of the Net-Zero Framework reflects the scale of differing national priorities, but it also underscores why collaboration and consistency matter more than ever.

At AET, our direction remains unchanged. We continue to strengthen our operations and advance our decarbonisation journey through a tiered, practical approach grounded in proven steps. We operate one of the youngest and most efficient fleets in the industry, we are growing our dual-fuel capabilities, and our retrofit programme is advancing to ensure our vessels remain competitive and compliant. These are tangible actions that support our customers’ ambitions and strengthen our long-term resilience.

Over the past two months, our teams have been active across the industry, contributing to key forums such as OCIMF, INTERTANKO, APPEC 2025, the Argus Sustainable Marine Fuels Conference, and Marine Fuels 360. These forums highlighted that there is no single route to decarbonisation. The transition will be powered by multiple fuel pathways including LNG, biofuels, ammonia, hydrogen, and underpinned by strong partnerships and readiness.

We recently received Approval in Principle (AiP) from Bureau Veritas (BV) for our strategic Joint Development Project with MISC, and Samsung Heavy Industries (SHI). The project integrates Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC) technology with an ammonia cracking system. This milestone reflects our determination to turn innovation into practical progress, advancing new technologies that bring us closer to our net zero-emission goals. Our role is to help our customers navigate the energy transition safely, efficiently and with confidence.

Safety, as always, is the foundation of everything we do. At the recent Care & Comply Partners’ Summit 2025, hosted by MISC Group, I joined peers and partners in reaffirming that safety is not a target but a shared culture – one built on leadership, accountability and care. It also means creating an environment where people feel safe to speak up, learn and improve. This commitment to psychological safety is essential to sustaining performance and trust across our global operations. I continue to visit our ships globally and hear first hand where we can improve further.

That same belief in continuous learning shapes how we invest in people and the future of our industry. Through initiatives like the AET-MaritimeONE scholarships and our partnerships with universities and organisations globally, we are helping to develop the next generation of maritime professionals – equipping them with the skills and perspective to lead our industry forward.

As we move forward, we’ll continue to focus on what has always defined AET: caring for our people, delivering for our customers, and upholding the highest standards of safety and integrity.

My thanks to our customers, partners and colleagues whose support and commitment continue to drive our progress.

Charting the Future of Tanker Shipping: AET at APPEC 2025

Smriti Sharma, our Global Director of Strategy, Sustainability and ERM, spoke on a panel – “Charting tanker shipping’s next phase” at APPEC’s Shipping and Bunker Conference in Singapore on 10 September 2025.

Together with her fellow panellists and moderator from Gibson Shipbrokers, Prudent Shipping Investment and S&P Global Commodity Insights, they delved into topics such as assessing freight outlooks against the background of trade flows being affected by global conflicts, evaluating net-zero targets and implications for tanker pools, as well as fleet renewal trends across global tanker markets.

Smriti explained that while LNG remains the most viable option for the near term, AET is also preparing for ammonia as a future fuel and recognises that biofuels will play a growing role. In her view, shipping’s path to net zero will be shaped by multiple fuel solutions, supported by collaboration across the value chain to ensure the right infrastructure is in place.

She also noted that the energy transition is a “one-way street” — that while the pace may differ, the direction is set. For shipowners like us, early investment in sustainable solutions can provide meaningful differentiation and long-term value.

Safety First in Fuel Transitions: AET at the Argus Sustainable Marine Fuels Conference

What role could ammonia and hydrogen play in powering North America’s fleet? That was the question that anchored the panel “Fleet First: How Shipowners are Balancing Risk, Regulation, and ROI in a Sustainable Marine Fuels Industry” at the Argus Media Sustainable Marine Fuels Conference in Houston on 12 September 2025.

Santiago Yanez, AET’s Head of Business Development (New Energy) & Technology, joined industry peers from Sumitomo Corporation of Americas, Argus, and Navigator Gas to unpack the opportunity and challenges ahead.

Together, the panellists addressed the pace of ammonia production on the U.S. Gulf Coast, the challenge of aligning supply and demand, and the potential impact of upcoming IMO regulations.

Sharing AET’s perspective, Santiago highlighted the importance of safety, regulation, and readiness in enabling the energy transition. “If regulations provide support, the rest of the ecosystem will follow,” he noted. He added, “We’ve been working with industry peers and authorities to develop and validate training for our seafarers. Safety will always remain our top priority.”

While the panel agreed there is no one-fuel solution, they highlighted the importance of preparing now, especially as the training market for ammonia begins to grow.

At AET, we see the energy transition as a journey that requires strong collaboration across the industry – from safety training to knowledge-sharing – to ensure readiness for the next generation of fuels. We remain committed to contributing to that collective effort.

Scaling Ammonia Adoption: Building the Pathway to Future Fuels

At Marine Fuels 360 2025 in Singapore on 8 October 2025, AET joined industry peers from NYK Bulkship Asia, Fleet Management and ITOCHU Corporation to discuss how the maritime sector can accelerate the adoption of ammonia as a marine fuel.

The session examined the practical building blocks for scaling ammonia bunkering in Asia: infrastructure and port readiness, regulatory frameworks, commercial incentives and the upskilling of seafarers to handle new fuels safely.

Representing AET, Head of Decarbonisation Sobhith Hariharan shared how shipowners are preparing for this shift. He outlined AET’s approach to balancing investment and readiness, guided by long-term emissions reduction goals, charterer partnerships and evolving regulations. Drawing from AET’s early experience in developing the world’s first ammonia dual-fuel Aframax tankers, he reinforced the importance of shared responsibility in advancing future fuel adoption.

The discussion reflected a collective drive to move from intent to impact. Across the panel there was consensus that scaling new fuels will depend on deep collaboration across the value chain and a shared commitment to safety, regulation and practical implementation. Panellists also agreed that incentives for greener fuels and a decline in ammonia prices could be the twin catalysts needed to make large-scale deployment viable by the early 2030s.

#AETcares: Small Actions, Big Impact

At AET, caring for communities and environments means taking action — and recent initiatives across our offices show how small steps can create meaningful change.

In Houston, a group of colleagues recently spent a day volunteering at the Galveston Bay Foundation’s aquatic nursery, preparing ponds that nurture over 2,500 native wetland plants. Their work involved tending to about 200 plants over 17 volunteer hours. These efforts help protect coastal ecosystems, strengthen shorelines, and create vital habitats for wildlife. It’s a reminder that real impact often begins with simple, hands-on efforts.

The same spirit of purpose was evident in Singapore, where AET and MISC colleagues — together with their families — took part in Walk for Our Children 2025, organised by the Singapore Children’s Society. This year’s theme, “Creating Safe Space, One Connection at a Time”, highlighted the power of everyday relationships within families and communities in helping young people thrive. The event raised vital funds to sustain the Society’s programmes and services, turning every step into support for children and families in need.

Back at our Singapore office, Project Heartbeat, a meaningful fundraiser held on 16 September 2025, brought colleagues together to raise funds through food stalls, games, and handcrafted items. Thanks to the generosity and collective effort of all involved, the event raised nearly 5000USD which will be matched by AET. But beyond the amount collected, the day was a celebration of unity in action and a testament to how much more we can achieve when we unite for a common cause.

From restoring wetlands and supporting children to fundraising for those in need, these efforts reflect what #AETcares is all about: showing up, standing together, and turning compassion into action. Every step, big or small, helps build a more sustainable and connected future.

In their efforts to devise solutions, drive innovation, and attract financing, these leaders are reshaping global climate action. As part of that process, they are increasingly recognising that decarbonising shipping – an industry that generates nearly three per cent of global greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions – could be a powerful catalyst for Africa’s green industrialisation.

African governments have already emerged as key players in negotiations over reductions in shipping emissions. Earlier this year, they helped secure the approval of the Net-Zero Framework at the International Maritime Organisation, the United Nations’ maritime regulator. Included in the framework is the world’s first binding pricing mechanism on GHG emissions from ships. This measure, which the IMO is expected to adopt formally at its upcoming October session, represents an important victory for multilateral climate action and signals the beginning of the end of shipping’s dependence on fossil fuels.

But the real test will be how this pivotal policy is designed and implemented over the next few years. For African governments, the biggest question is how the revenues generated from the IMO’s pricing mechanism, projected to be $10-15 billion per year by 2030, will be used.

If distributed equitably, these funds could help Africa close its huge energy gap, upgrade its port infrastructure and fleets, and invest in transmission networks and grids that could unlock our vast renewable-energy potential, especially in geothermal, wind, and solar. A resilient grid is also essential for the production of renewable hydrogen and other green e-fuels – the most promising long-term clean-energy solution for the shipping industry. This would likely provide a boost to Africa’s existing green-hydrogen projects and spur new ones, in the process accelerating industrialisation, boosting GDP, and positioning the continent as a global energy exporter.

Until now, Africa has faced challenges in developing its abundant renewable resources largely because of the high cost of capital. African economies remain weighed down by unsustainable debt burdens and low credit ratings, which make it prohibitively expensive to invest in clean energy. Given the perceived risks, the continent currently receives only around 2 per cent of global investment in renewables. But the revenues raised from the IMO’s new carbon-pricing mechanism could be used to lower initial costs, de-risk clean-energy investments, and pave the way for Africa to power global shipping.

Crucially, the IMO must support this drive to harness Africa’s renewable resources by creating strong incentives for e-fuels. Otherwise, cheaper options such as liquefied natural gas, which is far more destructive to the planet, and crop-based biofuels, which increase pressure on food systems, risk undercutting green hydrogen and impeding African countries’ efforts to achieve sustainable growth and development.

The increased use of biofuels would be particularly catastrophic for African countries. In my country, Nigeria, where millions of people already face acute hunger, diverting crops to create fuel for ships – often carrying goods and supplies bound for wealthy countries – would be both immoral and economically reckless. Generating biofuels would likely worsen food insecurity and increase deforestation, GHG emissions, and land degradation – in some cases, to a greater extent than fossil-fuel production.

Like many other African countries, Nigeria has everything it takes to become a leader in sustainable shipping fuels, including abundant sun and wind, and a young workforce. Now it just needs the right investments. If designed properly the IMO’s framework could help provide the funds that Africa needs to ramp up its renewable-energy capacity. Failure to create an ambitious, equitable policy risks limiting Africa’s prospects.

As the IMO gathers in London this month to adopt its Net-Zero Framework, African countries must show the same leadership and determination as they did at the Second Africa Climate Summit. Ensuring that the continent reaps the benefits of the IMO’s new mechanism would be a remarkable example of international cooperation. A climate-resilient future is within reach, so long as African voices are heard, and taken seriously, on the global stage.

In mid-October, IMO member states voted to delay the Net-Zero Framework's adoption by a year due to strong US opposition, prompting doubts over the global regulator piece's future fate.

""This outcome opens the door to a fragmented landscape of carbon pricing mechanisms introduced by individual regions and countries,"" Wartsila President and CEO Hakan Agnevall said in the company's latest quarterly report.

The uncertainty comes as the EU has already implemented its own emissions trading system for shipping, while China is signaling plans for its own programs, adding complexity to global shipping operations and potentially influencing ship technology choices, according to the company.

Marine business outlook

Despite the regulatory challenges, Wartsila expects the demand environment for its marine business to improve over the next 12 months as shipping companies turn optimistic over future demand.

""Marine market sentiment has improved recently following a slow start to the year, supported by trade agreements between major economies, and the resilience in global trade,"" Agnevall said.

The company said demand for alternative-fuel-capable ships has remained strong, representing 48% of contracted capacity so far in 2025, indicating that a large portion of shipowners have continued to prepare for a lower-carbon future despite regulatory uncertainties.

While new ship ordering activity has slowed compared to what Agnevall described as ""extraordinary levels"" in 2024, it remains above the 10-year average, with particularly healthy activity in Wartsila's key segments.

""The impact on shipping demand has been uneven across segments, and growth in seaborne trade has moderated,"" Agnevall said, pointing to factors such as ongoing uncertainty around trade policies, elevated newbuild prices and softer demand in some shipping segments that have negatively affected new ship orders this year.

Technology response

Wartsila emphasized its readiness to support various decarbonization pathways amid the evolving regulatory landscape, positioning itself as a provider of flexible solutions for shipowners navigating uncertain requirements.

""We are helping our customers navigate the transition by optimising fuel efficiency and de-risking the future through fuel flexibility, leveraging hybrid solutions, alternative fuels, and carbon capture,"" Agnevall said.

Sustainable marine energy has remained much more expensive than conventional, oil-based bunker fuels, and some shipping professionals have said companies should invest in energy-efficiency measures for now to cut fuel expenses before investing in certain alternative fuels due to persistent regulatory uncertainty.

The monthly average delivered bunker price for 0.5% sulfur fuel oil, the most common bunker type, was $11.80/Gj in Singapore in September, compared with $14.13/Gj for LNG, $16.88/Gj for B24 biobunker fuel with 24% used cooking oil methyl ester and $46.28/Gj for 100% sustainable methanol, according to the bunker cost calculator(opens in a new tab) from Platts, part of S&P Global Commodity Insights.

Wartsila said its overall order intake increased 5% year over year to Eur5.88 billion ($6.86 billion) over January-September, with organic growth at 8%. The order book at the end of the period rose 14% to Eur8.6 billion.

The company's comparable operating result increased 18% to Eur573 million, representing 11.7% of net sales, up from 10.5% in the same period last year.

Wartsila, which operates in the marine and energy segments, said high geopolitical uncertainty, changing global trade patterns and unclear tariff policies create risks of investment postponements and potential slowdowns in global economic activity.",https://www.spglobal.com/content/dam/spglobal/ci/en/images/platts/general/favicon.ico,N,,2025-10-29 16:00:12.469192

Japan Tests Marine Hydrogen Engine on Land

Japan’s drive to decarbonize global shipping has taken a decisive step forward with the world’s first land-based operation of marine hydrogen engines. The test, conducted jointly by Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Yanmar Power Solutions and Japan Engine Corporation, demonstrated stable hydrogen combustion for ship engines designed to propel next-generation zero-emission vessels.

The trial, carried out at Japan Engine’s headquarters factory, used a newly installed liquefied hydrogen fuel supply system that delivers fuel at both high and low pressure—enabling testing across a range of marine engine types.

The achievement forms part of Japan’s Green Innovation Fund Projects, managed by the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO). The initiative is a key component of Japan’s 2050 carbon neutrality strategy, backed by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI).

Inside the Demonstration

Under NEDO’s “Development of Marine Hydrogen Engine and MHFS” programme, Kawasaki Heavy Industries engineered a liquefied hydrogen fuel supply system capable of storing and vaporising liquid hydrogen for delivery to partner engines. The system’s versatility allows testing across multiple applications, including low-speed two-stroke propulsion units, medium-speed auxiliary engines and main generator engines for electric-propulsion ships.

Kawasaki and Yanmar successfully demonstrated hydrogen combustion in medium-speed four-stroke engines, confirming stable operation at rated output—a critical milestone towards zero-emission power systems. Japan Engine is continuing development of a low-speed, two-stroke hydrogen engine, with first operation scheduled for spring 2026.

All three engines employ a dual-fuel configuration, switching between hydrogen and diesel. This design preserves safety and operational redundancy while enabling substantial greenhouse gas reductions during hydrogen use.

Strategic Significance for Maritime Decarbonization

International shipping, which contributes nearly 3% of global emissions, faces mounting regulatory pressure to decarbonise. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has set a target to achieve net-zero GHG emissions “by or around 2050,” prompting governments and shipbuilders to pursue scalable, alternative-fuel solutions.

Hydrogen is emerging as a key contender for deep-sea decarbonisation, though challenges around storage, distribution and combustion stability remain significant. Japan’s demonstration offers early evidence that liquefied hydrogen can be safely and effectively used for maritime propulsion when supported by advanced fuel systems and dual-fuel flexibility.

“Liquid hydrogen is a vital key to realising a sustainable energy society, and we have long been committed to building the technological foundation to support it,” said Kei Nomura, Executive Central Manager of Kawasaki Heavy Industries’ Hydrogen Strategy Division. He added that the company’s expertise in hydrogen production, storage, transportation and reception places it in a strong position to advance hydrogen-fuelled shipping globally.

Governance and Funding Context

The Green Innovation Fund, established by METI and managed by NEDO, channels approximately ¥2 trillion (US$13 billion) into technologies aligned with Japan’s Green Growth Strategy. The fund supports decarbonisation across key industrial sectors, including mobility, energy and materials.

The marine hydrogen project benefits from this framework, bridging R&D with pre-commercial testing. Additional government allocations—¥300 billion in FY2022 and ¥456 billion in FY2023—reflect Japan’s continued emphasis on hydrogen infrastructure and its role in national energy resilience.

By integrating technology development with policy support, Japan is positioning itself as a first mover in hydrogen propulsion—laying the groundwork for commercial deployment of zero-emission vessels that could transform maritime logistics and trade routes.

Next Steps and Global Implications

Following the successful land-based trial, Kawasaki, Yanmar and Japan Engine plan to collaborate with shipowners and shipyards to conduct onboard demonstrations. These real-world trials will validate engine performance and safety in operational conditions, a prerequisite for regulatory approval and commercial rollout.

The consortium aims to standardise hydrogen engine systems for global shipbuilders, enabling future vessels to run partially or fully on hydrogen. Their success could accelerate the transition of international shipping fleets toward carbon neutrality, aligning industrial technology with the IMO’s decarbonisation roadmap.

Shipping is responsible for almost 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions, a figure expected to rise in the coming years, making it essential to deploy cleaner, scalable, and economically viable solutions that meet tightening international climate regulations.

To respond to this need, the MARPOWER project is developing a gas-turbine based energy conversion system for both electricity generation and cogeneration on board ships. The system is designed for operation with hydrogen and other net-zero fuel alternatives like ammonia, green methane or green methanol, while combining advanced turbo machinery and energy recovery technologies. With this approach, the project aims to reduce emissions while ensuring that the maritime sector remains competitive and reliable during its transition to cleaner energy.

Core power system and turbomachinery design

The consortium has advanced the design of the system’s electrical generator, including geometry, thermal behavior, and loss estimations, to ensure reliable performance under demanding marine conditions. Building on this, the first high-pressure (HP) shaft has been fully designed, incorporating active magnetic bearings (AMBs) that allow high-speed rotors to run with minimal wear and reduced energy losses.

In parallel, conceptual and three-dimensional (3D) designs of compressors and turbines have been completed. An internal cooling system for high pressure turbine blades has been designed to withstand turbine inlet temperatures up to 1200 °C. Combustion chamber prototypes are under preparation, supported by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations and upgraded experimental facilities for hydrogen testing. These results provide a strong foundation for future assembly and experimental validation.

Heat recovery innovation

A recuperator system has been designed, featuring a new heat surface geometry and automated manufacturing approaches. Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and CFD simulations confirm its robustness under extreme gradients and ship motions. Work has also begun on a complementary Waste Heat Recovery (WHR) boiler to maximize overall system efficiency.

Digital twin development

A digital twin platform has been launched to model and validate the full energy conversion system. Combining component models, real-world data, and virtual operating environments, the twin enables predictive performance analysis and reduces risks and costs ahead of prototyping.

Sustainable fuels and safety

Comparative evaluations of alternative fuels, including hydrogen, methanol, and ammonia, have been conducted, covering techno-economic potential as well as health, safety, and environmental (HSE) considerations. The studies address flammability, toxicity, handling risks, and regulatory aspects, ensuring that the MARPOWER system can flexibly operate with different fuels under safe and compliant conditions.

Regulatory readiness and sustainability assessment

From the outset, the consortium has developed technical requirements, safety guidelines, and regulatory mapping to ensure alignment with maritime certification pathways. Preliminary Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Life Cycle Costing (LCC) frameworks have also been established to evaluate the environmental and economic performance of the MARPOWER system.

Exploitation planning

Key Exploitable Results (KERs) have been identified, and exploitation strategies are being developed to pave the way for market uptake of MARPOWER technologies in the coming years.

While the first year has delivered strong progress, the next phases of the MARPOWER project will focus on technical tasks, particularly integrating the different component designs into a coherent gas turbine system, alongside ensuring alignment with regulatory, safety, and operational requirements. Key areas include validating rotor dynamics and active magnetic bearings under real ship-motion conditions, ensuring the durability of turbine cooling systems and recuperators under extreme temperatures, and completing experimental studies on safe and efficient combustion with alternative fuels. At the system level, consolidating partner contributions into a unified digital twin and aligning safety and regulatory requirements across multiple fuel types will require close coordination

At the International Maritime Organization (IMO) in London, U.S. pressure proved decisive in delaying adoption of a new net-zero emissions framework for shipping. After weeks of tense negotiation, the vote to postpone the measure by one year passed narrowly, with 57 in favour and 49 against, derailing what would have been the industry’s first global carbon-pricing mechanism.

The U.S. argued that the proposed levy on maritime emissions would raise consumer costs by around 10%, and threatened sanctions, visa restrictions, and port fees against nations voting in favour. Backed by Saudi Arabia, Russia, and Venezuela, the U.S. successfully persuaded several key flag states to withdraw support, effectively halting progress on a binding framework.

The decision has angered environmental groups and investors seeking a predictable framework for green fuel investment. Analysts now warn of fragmented regional carbon schemes, slower progress on decarbonisation, and renewed dominance of liquefied natural gas (LNG) as the default transition fuel.

However, the delay appears to have done little to dent the industry’s confidence. In the two weeks since the IMO vote, shipping lines have continued to place significant new-build orders, with the containership order-book ratio surpassing 33% of the global fleet for the first time since 2009.

More orders are expected in the coming weeks as carriers push ahead with long-term fleet renewal plans, signalling sustained appetite for capacity growth despite regulatory uncertainty.

Trump’s Asia Tour: Trade Wins and Strategic Balancing

Even as Washington disrupted global climate diplomacy, President Donald Trump was securing new trade concessions across Southeast Asia. During his recent tour, the U.S. concluded four separate deals aimed at deepening regional economic ties and diversifying away from China.

Vietnam agreed to maintain 20% tariffs on U.S. goods but will move toward zero tariffs on selected products. The two countries will also cooperate on digital trade, export-control enforcement and anti-evasion measures.

Thailand retained its 19% tariff rate but committed to eliminate duties on 99% of U.S. goods, opening a broad range of consumer and industrial markets.

Malaysia and Cambodia went further, signing comprehensive reciprocal agreements that cap ad valorem tariffs at no more than 19%.

U.S.–China: A Cautious Thaw

Trump’s whirlwind tour culminates on Thursday 30 October with a long-awaited meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, their first in six years. The two leaders will meet on the sidelines of an Asia-Pacific summit, where negotiators have already framed a tentative agreement that would halt new U.S. tariffs and ease Chinese export controls on rare-earth minerals, which are essential for EVs, semiconductors and defence technology.

Shanghai caught much attention from global attendees with its endeavors to build more green shipping corridors with overseas partners at the opening of 2025 North Bund Forum, according to Xinhua Silk Road on Tuesday (21 October).

Currently, the green shipping corridors built together with several European and American ports are advancing intensive application of emission-reduction technologies and multiple-party participation to establish a testing field for global shipping industry transformation.

For instance, Shanghai port is co-founding a green Ro-Ro shipping corridor together with Port of Barcelona in Spain and Port of Antwerp-Bruges in Belgium. Other Chinese ports are building similar green shipping corridors with German and French ports.

After a year-long operation, the Shanghai-Hamburg green shipping corridor unveiled in 2024, has forged ahead in sustainable development.

Apart from the regular shore power service, Shanghai port’s container berths can now refuel LNG and green methanol, while Hamburg port’s berths with 100 percent green shore power service plans to start methanol injection service this year, ready to co-craft an emission-reduction model for Eurasian shipping routes.

Meanwhile, Port of Melbourne announced it has joined forces with Port of Shanghai, with an aim to establish a Green Shipping Corridor between the two ports. The agreement was formalised at the 2025 North Bund Forum in Shanghai, China, on 19 October.

This joint initiative, supported by the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), brings together Port of Melbourne and Shanghai Municipal Transportation Commission (SMTC) in response to the Clydebank Declaration and the broader decarbonisation of the maritime supply chain.

Under the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), the parties will seek to:

Collaborate with industry partners – including Shanghai International Port Group (SIPG), COSCO SHIPPING Lines, HAMR Energy, and ABEL Energy – to explore avenues to implement measures to reduce the environmental impact of the shipping industry.

Focus on environmentally sustainable practices, such as the adoption of cleaner technologies, use of renewable energy sources, and implementation of best practices to minimise the ecological footprint of shipping activities.

Work closely with shipping lines seeking to promote the adoption of clean fuels, with the goal of increasing the usage of clean-energy-powered ships operating between Shanghai and Melbourne.

Explore opportunities with energy suppliers to accelerate breakthroughs in production technology, improve efficiency and cost control, and establish an integrated supply chain system covering production, transportation, and storage to boost low carbon fuel supply capacity.

Saul Cannon, Chief Executive Officer of Port of Melbourne, said: “This MoU is a significant development in our work towards decarbonising the supply chain. Given Australia’s position as an island-nation that heavily relies on sea freight, we have a key role in global efforts to decarbonise shipping.”

“As Australia’s largest container port working together with the world’s largest container port, we are well-placed to lead by example towards a greener future for our industry. We look forward to working with our industry partners to progress this initiative,” Mr Cannon added.

China is Port of Melbourne’s largest trading partner, accounting for 50 percent of total container imports and 20 percent of container exports. With the high volume of trade between both ports, this partnership has the potential to provide material benefits for the environment.

This milestone is a culmination of a nearly two-decade-long partnership between Port of Melbourne and SMTC, which commenced in 2006.

The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Shanghai Green Shipping Corridor, the first partnership of its kind across the Pacific, reached a new milestone on Monday (20 October).

The LA-LB-SH Green Shipping Corridor (GSC), facilitated by C40 Cities, has successfully delivered on its phase 1 milestones, including the expansion of shore power infrastructure to meet 100% electrification serving container vessels, deploying reduced lifecycle carbon-capable vessels, and scaling sustainable fuel bunkering operations.

The corridor partners presented their second Annual Progress Report at the North Bund International Shipping Forum 2025 on 20 October.

The report highlighted the significant progress made by the Partnership since the launch of the GSC, specifically over the past year, and outlines the steps planned to achieve future milestones, including demonstrating the feasibility of deploying zero lifecycle carbon emission container ships by 2030.

In March 2025, partners gathered at the Port of Long Beach for the second in-person meeting, in which the corridor partners reaffirmed their consensus on the corridor goals, further detailed additional actions for addressing challenges, and launched a fourth working group to focus on Metrics and Evaluation.

Along with the other dedicated working groups – Energy Supply, Carriers, and Ports– the partners continue to make progress towards their respective missions:

Ports Working Group

Expanded shore power infrastructure to reach 100% capability in Shanghai, Los Angeles, and Long Beach, cutting emissions while ships are docked and improving air quality for local communities. The Los Angeles and Long Beach Ports completed the installation of shore power to meet earlier mandated State regulations.

Bunkered more than 47,000 metric tonnes (mt) of green methanol at the Port of Shanghai, and realised China’s first linkage for domestically produced green methanol. Ports of LA and Long Beach are preparing for a methanol pilot project.

Commissioned a Clean Fuels Study for POLA/POLB and prepared for a clean marine fuel pilot project.

Building on the successful completion of Phase One milestone targets, the partners will continue to tackle significant challenges in 2026 and beyond:

Addressing the future of clean marine fuels due to the shifting regulatory, permitting, and policy landscape, such as the IMO’s Net Zero Framework.

Addressing market uncertainty on clean marine fuel supply and demand.

(G E Shipping), India’s largest private-sector shipping company.
“Our decarbonization efforts are in line with the Indian government’s Maritime Amrit Kaal Vision 2047 and the Harit Sagar initiatives,” says Gupta.
“As the country’s leading private-sector shipping company, we feel a responsibility to champion this transition.
Michael Petersen – Senior Vice President and Head of Everllence PrimeServ, Denmark – said: “We’re proud to support COSCO SHIPPING LINES and COSCO SHIPPING HEAVY INDUSTRY — and the maritime industry as a whole — in taking this significant step toward decarbonising shipping.
This milestone highlights COSCO SHIPPING LINES’ role as a first mover and presents a practical path for reducing emissions from Everllence S90 engine vessels.","In a recent Maritime Impact article, classifiction society DNV offered a look into Great Eastern Shipping’s approach to decarbonization including bio bunker fuel trials, collaborating for green hydrogen and ammonia infrastructure and energy-saving retrofits:

In a time of regulatory uncertainty and evolving fuel options, shipowners like Great Eastern Shipping are taking a pragmatic route to decarbonization by focusing on flexible fleet upgrades and operational efficiencies while supporting Indian ports and government construction of a low-GHG fuel infrastructure.

As the shipping industry responds to IMO’s decarbonization goals for 2050, along with the interim targets for 2030 and 2040, many questions remain unanswered, reflecting the complexity of the path ahead. “The major challenge is the regulatory uncertainty,” says Capt. Ankush Gupta, Chief Operating Officer of the Great Eastern Shipping Company Ltd. (G E Shipping), India’s largest private-sector shipping company. “We desperately need a clear, ﬁnal ‘basket of measures’, speciﬁcally the global fuel standard.”

Drop-in biofuels can reduce emissions immediately

As shipowners and operators plot a course towards net-zero, they must carefully weigh their options to manage the potential increase in emission- and fuel-related costs. Which new fuel will be available at scale, when, and what will be the price tag? How long will it take ports to build up an adequate global bunkering infrastructure for new fuels? How will all this change the competitive environment?

But this uncertainty has not stopped G E Shipping from taking action. “We are actively pursuing immediate, viable solutions,” says Gupta. “We’ve been a pioneer in India by successfully completing trials of marine biofuel blends on our tankers. This was a landmark achievement, demonstrating that sustainable drop-in fuels can achieve instant, meaningful emissions reductions in our existing ﬂeet without requiring massive capital investment in engine modifications.” G E Shipping is now using biofuels on selected voyages where supply logistics allow, Gupta adds.

Collaborating for green hydrogen and ammonia infrastructure in Indian ports

Operating a fleet of roughly 40 tankers, bulk carriers, and gas carriers, with more to be added soon, the company is pursuing a cautious but steady fleet renewal strategy in line with India’s ambitious national maritime vision.

“Our decarbonization efforts are in line with the Indian government’s Maritime Amrit Kaal Vision 2047 and the Harit Sagar initiatives,” says Gupta. “As the country’s leading private-sector shipping company, we feel a responsibility to champion this transition. We’re very open to collaborating with Indian ports and government bodies, providing operational insights to help them shape the necessary infrastructure for green shipping corridors, especially in line with the national vision for green hydrogen and ammonia.”

Energy-saving devices and operational measures buy time

DNV’s Maritime Advisory experts completed a decarbonization study for G E Shipping’s entire fleet a few years ago, resulting in CII ratings and a decarbonization plan that delivers actionable recommendations. This has enabled G E Shipping to commit its resources to the most effective and cost-efficient measures. “Our primary focus is on energy-saving devices, installed during dry dockings,” says Gupta. “We’ve invested heavily in propulsion eﬃciency, ﬁtting pre-swirl devices and high-eﬃciency propellers to reduce energy losses. These technical retroﬁts, along with engine part-load optimization, high-performance hull coatings, and hull cleaning, deliver substantial fuel and CO2 reductions.”

Proactive biofouling management and the use of combustion catalysts are supporting these measures, while advanced voyage optimization and smarter autopilot systems help the vessels select the most eﬃcient itineraries, achieving additional, measurable savings. G E Shipping is also exploring just-in-time arrival, working with the Blue Visby Consortium. “For the long term, our R&D evaluates technologies like air lubrication systems, wind-assisted propulsion, and onboard carbon capture as critical components for meeting our ultimate decarbonization goals,” remarks Gupta.

Nevertheless, the company is well aware that these are short-term ﬁxes, he adds. “These operational measures buy us time, but they won’t meet the ambitious mid-term targets.”

Singapore-based Pacific International Lines (PIL) on Tuesday (28 October) announced the naming of our fourth 8,200 TEU LNG dual-fuel ‘O’-Class container vessel, Kota Orkid.

The vessel was named by Lady Sponsor Mrs Annie Yap, wife of PIL Board Director Mr Yap Chee Keong, at the Yangzijiang Shipbuilding yard in Jiangsu, China. The name was inspired by Singapore’s national flower.

Kota Orkid joins sister ‘O’ Class ships – Kota Oasis, Kota Ocean, and Kota Odyssey – on PIL’s South West Africa Service (SWS), enhancing connectivity between Asia and West Africa. With this addition, PIL strengthens its service capacity and flexibility.

Mr. S.S. Teo, Executive Chairman of PIL, said: “The naming of our eighth newbuild vessel in the last one year is another step forward in our fleet expansion and renewal strategy. As we grow our LNG-powered fleet, we are not only investing in capacity and technology but also in greener shipping. This vessel will play a key role in enhancing our service offerings and delivering greater value to our customers.”

Kota Orkid is PIL’s eighth LNG-powered vessel delivered to date. Alongside the four ‘O’ Class vessels delivered this year, PIL has also received four 14,000 TEU LNG dual-fuel vessels since 2024. The company has another 12 LNG dual-fuel vessels on order, including five 13,000 TEU and seven 9,000 TEU ships, scheduled for delivery in the coming years.

Mr Lars Kastrup, CEO of PIL, added, “Kota Orkid demonstrates how PIL’s fleet is becoming cleaner, smarter, and more efficient. As we embrace greener fuels, and leverage advanced technology and digital systems, we ensure that PIL remains sustainable, resilient and future-focused to meet the evolving demands of global trade with agility and innovation.”

These vessels are equipped with engines that significantly reduce methane emissions and offer the flexibility to run on bio-methane fuels. Their hydrodynamic hull designs and advanced anti-fouling coatings also contribute to better fuel efficiency.

Everllence on Monday (27 October) announced the world’s first conversion of an Everllence B&W S90 two-stroke engine to dual-fuel methanol running following the successful sea-trials of COSCO SHIPPING LINES’ 20,000+ TEU container vessel, Cosco Shipping Libra.

The vessel’s 11S90ME-C engine was retrofitted to an 11S90ME-LGIM (-Liquid Gas Injection Methanol) unit.

Everllence PrimeServ – Everllence’s after-sales division – partnered with COSCO SHIPPING HEAVY INDUSTRY from concept to execution in delivering the world’s first S90 methanol engine retrofit, a full-scope project covering engineering, project management, installation, commissioning and sea-trials.

As part of the process, Everllence invested in a dedicated 4S90 testbed engine in Japan that was commissioned in early 2025. The testbed validated the S90 engine’s methanol performance under real operating conditions, accelerating its readiness for this ‘first-ever’ large-bore milestone.

Michael Petersen – Senior Vice President and Head of Everllence PrimeServ, Denmark – said: “We’re proud to support COSCO SHIPPING LINES and COSCO SHIPPING HEAVY INDUSTRY — and the maritime industry as a whole — in taking this significant step toward decarbonising shipping. This milestone highlights COSCO SHIPPING LINES’ role as a first mover and presents a practical path for reducing emissions from Everllence S90 engine vessels.

“It also showcases Everllence’s capability to deliver large-scale retrofit projects. With 26 dual-fuel conversions already completed and an even larger pipeline across various alternative fuels, shipowners can trust Everllence to deliver retrofit solutions at scale.”

Looking beyond the Cosco Shipping Libra retrofit that proves the viability of methanol as a marine fuel, Everllence believes that the potential for further large-bore retrofits is substantial with over 300 vessels worldwide currently equipped with S90-class engines and therefore potential candidates for similar retrofits.

Petersen added: “While the journey toward full decarbonisation will require collaboration across the industry, this achievement demonstrates that large-scale conversions are both technically proven and commercially viable. This opens a practical pathway towards accelerating the maritime energy transition together with our customers.”

Manifold Times previously reported China Shipping & Sinopec Suppliers completing the first ship-to-ship methanol bunkering operation in a shipyard in China and the first of such service on the major shipping route along Yangtze River.

The company, with the cooperation of SIPG Energy (Shanghai) Co Ltd, successfully completed the bunkering of more than 2,000 metric tonnes (mt) of methanol fuel to the 20,000 TEU ultra-large methanol dual-fuel container ship COSCO Shipping Libra.

Furthermore, greater convergence between the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is needed to create a coherent global framework for nuclear-powered shipping.

Existing conventions, including the 1981 Nuclear Ship Code, are ill-equipped to support the development and integration of modern nuclear systems and must be revised if the technology is to move beyond pilot projects.

SMRs: The future of maritime nuclear technology

Advanced small modular reactors (SMRs) promise affordable safe nuclear energy, paving the way for a new nuclear age. The future of nuclear technology lies with SMRs. These new kinds of reactors are significantly smaller than conventional nuclear reactors, while retaining an impressive capacity for power generation (up to 300 MW(e) per unit). SMRs for maritime applications will be built in dedicated manufacturing plants and then transported to a shipyard for integration into a marine asset.

This could be for either power generation, such as with an FNPP, or for vessel propulsion. SMR designs that do not rely on traditional pressurized water technology are known as advanced modular reactors (AMRs) or Generation IV reactors. They include high-temperature gas reactors, molten-salt reactors and liquid-metal reactors, among others. An improved nuclear safety profile AMRs promise safer operations through passive safety designs.

Thanks to the use of new fuels and/or different coolants for the reactor, these new designs use natural phenomena to protect the reactor core from melting down. The systems can even shut down without external power or human action when necessary. This ensures a “walk-away-safe” state during emergencies. These newer designs could also lead to much smaller emergency planning zones (EPZs) compared to traditional water-cooled reactors.

However, relevant IAEA discussions are ongoing and national safety regulators still need to adopt formal positions on the issue.

Accelerating the successful and sustainable deployment of nuclear energy would enable a comprehensive response to the world’s energy challenges: energy security, eradicating energy poverty, and climate change mitigation.

…said Dr. Federico Puente Espel Maritime Nuclear Strategy Leader, Bureau Veritas Marine & Offshore.

Growing momentum is already visible, with initiatives such as the IAEA’s Atomic Technology License for Applications at Sea (ATLAS) expected project, combined with the IMO’s first steps to review the 1981 Nuclear Ship Code.

Yet, if the industry is to realize the potential of nuclear propulsion technology, renewed cooperation from the insurance community through the reopening of the 1962 Brussels Convention is essential. According to BV, as dedicated land infrastructure and a robust supply chain will be needed, this will call for greater support for nuclear power as a clean energy source from financial institutions.

There is no single option to replace the maritime industry’s reliance on fossil fuels, but nuclear power has a clear and vital role to play. As work to update insurance and regulatory frameworks progresses in 2025, nuclear energy could become a viable solution for a large segment of the global fleet. […]

Updating SOLAS VIII and the nuclear ship code

Work is underway to update the two key international agreements governing the use of nuclear technology in a civil maritime context. The International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) is one of the most important international treaties governing the safety of civilian ships at sea. It was first adopted in 1914 and has since been amended many times. Chapter VIII of the 1974 SOLAS Convention, which is the version currently in force, outlines basic requirements for nuclear-powered ships.

To complement this chapter, in 1981, IMO approved Resolution A.491(XII), thereby adopting the Code of Safety of Nuclear Merchant Ships. This code, otherwise known as the Nuclear Ship Code, provides the most comprehensive rules for civilian nuclear ships to date. However, it has not been amended since its initial adoption and does not fully address developments that have taken place in the ensuing decades. IMO has acknowledged the need to update the Nuclear Ship Code and SOLAS Chapter VIII to create a regulatory framework that can effectively govern nuclear power’s role in the modern maritime industry.",https://safety4sea.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/nuclear-power-bv-e1761734432795.jpg,N,,2025-10-29 11:17:23.718026

Shipping as a Growing Source of Emissions The treaty breakdown occurred in the context of increased emissions from the shipping industry.
If current trends continue, shipping is projected to produce 10% of global emissions by 2050.
Reaching a Landmark Agreement In April 2025, the UN’s Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) approved draft regulations to reduce the shipping industry’s greenhouse gas emissions.
“Now you have one year,” said IMO Secretary General Dominguez to delegates after the vote.","On Oct. 14, 2025, representatives from over 100 countries met in London to ratify the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) Net-Zero Framework (NZF), a landmark treaty that would have required large ships to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Crafted by the IMO, the UN agency responsible for the “safety and security of shipping and the prevention of marine and atmospheric pollution by ships,” the deal was lauded by many in the shipping industry, and its final ratification was widely considered to be a formality.

But the October sessions ended without a ratified treaty.

On the session’s final day, Saudi Arabia filed a motion to adjourn the debate for one year. The motion passed 57 to 49, with pressure from the U.S. heavily impacting the vote. Now, the NZF cannot be ratified until October 2026 at the earliest.

In the wake of the setback, the IMO has promised to work towards building a consensus, and shipping industry insiders continue to advocate for global emissions standards.

Future efforts to ratify the NZF will likely face stiff opposition from the U.S. administration. That suggests that there is only one way to successfully ratify the agreement: Build a coalition that can withstand U.S. pressure.

Shipping as a Growing Source of Emissions

The treaty breakdown occurred in the context of increased emissions from the shipping industry.

Shipping currently produces one billion metric tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) each year, accounting for 3% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions. This figure has been steadily rising as global trade increases. If current trends continue, shipping is projected to produce 10% of global emissions by 2050.

Large ships weighing over 5,000 gross tonnes produce the bulk of the industry’s emissions — an estimated 85%.

In addition to CO2, the heavy fuel often used by cruise ships and other large vessels emits black carbon, methane, and sulphur oxides, all of which harm marine ecosystems.

Reaching a Landmark Agreement

In April 2025, the UN’s Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) approved draft regulations to reduce the shipping industry’s greenhouse gas emissions.

The NZF agreement would have held large ocean-going vessels to higher fuel standards. Ships failing to meet those standards were to balance their deficit by acquiring “remedial units” — meaning they would have had to offset their emissions.

If approved, the NZF would have represented the first worldwide regulatory framework to impose emission limits and greenhouse gas pricing on an entire industry.

The Trump Administration’s Firm Opposition

After the successful passage of the draft regulations, many hoped the NZF would take effect by 2027. Sensing a spirit of collaboration, IMO Secretary General Arsenio Dominguez even closed the April meetings with praise for the group’s “collective efforts.”

But in the lead-up to the final vote in October 2025, the U.S. pushed strongly against the agreement.

The Trump administration did not just argue against ratifying the IMO Net-zero Framework. It also threatened to punish countries that voted for ratification.

In a joint statement, key U.S. officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, characterised the agreement as a “European-led neocolonial export of global climate regulations.” They also promised to “protect our economic interests by imposing costs on countries if they support the NZF.” These costs, according to the statement, could include commercial penalties and a lack of access to U.S. ports.

When the MEPC ultimately voted to delay the NZF’s ratification, Rubio’s threats seemed to have been the decisive factor. A source from the European Union is reported to have said that “many countries” changed their vote due to U.S. pressure.

After the NZF’s ratification was suspended, Secretary Rubio wrote on X: “This is another HUGE win… Our country will continue to lead the way and put America FIRST.”

Industry Insiders Favor Global Regulations

The U.S. may consider the failed ratification to be a victory, but among shipping industry insiders, the reaction was less celebratory. Some are glad for the additional time for dialogue, but most agree that their real enemy is not environmental regulations, but uncertainty.

“We are disappointed that member states have not been able to agree a way forward at this meeting,” said Thomas A. Kazakos, Secretary General of the International Chamber of Shipping. “Industry needs clarity to be able to make the investments needed to decarbonise the maritime sector.”

Kostas Gkonis, the Secretary General of INTERCARGO (International Association of Dry Cargo Shipowners), said he appreciated that the adjournment would allow for further dialogue.

But unlike the Trump administration, Gkonis does not oppose an emissions deal altogether. He said he is looking forward to the adoption of “a regulatory framework that is realistic, practical, and globally workable.”

The shipping industry’s support for regulations could have a significant impact on future negotiations.

The Task Ahead: Overcoming U.S. Opposition

Despite the one-year adjournment, the IMO plans to keep working towards the NZF’s ratification. “Now you have one year,” said IMO Secretary General Dominguez to delegates after the vote. “You have one year to negotiate and talk and come to consensus.”

These negotiations are likely to take place amid sustained U.S. opposition.

The current U.S. administration’s anti-regulatory stance is largely ideological. U.S. President Donald Trump considers climate change to be a “scam,” and he has long opposed global climate measures. That leaves little hope that revised shipping guidelines would win the U.S. over.

Under these circumstances, the only way to ratify the NZF may be for IMO member nations to stand up to U.S. pressure. Advocates are already urging them to do just that.

Anaïs Rios of the NGO Seas At Risk called on countries to “rise up and come back to the IMO with a louder and more confident yes vote that cannot be silenced.”

For Alison Shaw, IMO Manager at the NGO Transport & Environment, the battle ahead is winnable. “[T]here is a clear desire to clean up the shipping industry,” Shaw said after the failed ratification attempt, “even in the face of U.S. bullying.”

The IMO has already committed to cutting the shipping industry’s emissions to net zero by 2050. Ratifying the NZF, even amid threats of U.S. retaliation, could be a major step toward getting there.",https://impakter.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Ship-Cover-2.jpg,N,,2025-10-29 11:17:34.391848

For Europe, the FuelEU Maritime Regulation[1] remains in force ( implemented since 1 January 2025) setting declining greenhouse-gas intensity targets for ships calling at EU ports. Because the IMO global framework vote was delayed, there is now a mismatch in timing between global maritime regulation and regional (EU) regulation which increases regulatory uncertainty for ship-owners and fuel producers: while FuelEU gives a clear EU path, the absence of a global signal means investments in alternative fuels may be hampered by fragmented regimes and uncertain future harmonisation.

This stance has sparked a strong reaction ahead of COP30, the global climate summit to be held next month.

According to him, global philanthropists should increase investments in projects aimed at preventing diseases and ensuring food, rather than focusing solely on reducing emissions. He argues that climate change will not destroy humanity, and that the prior experience in achieving net-zero emissions shows progress, but previous investments were misguided, and some efforts were costly and dubious.

“Climate change will not destroy humanity,” he noted, acknowledging progress toward achieving net-zero emissions. “However, previous investments in the fight against climate were misguided, and too much of the funds went to expensive and dubious projects.”

– Bill Gates

“Climate change, disease, and poverty are all serious problems,” Gates wrote. “We must address them in proportion to the suffering they cause.”

“Although climate change will have serious consequences – especially for people in the poorest countries – it will not lead to the extinction of humanity. It is an opportunity to focus on a metric that matters even more than emissions and temperature change: improving lives. Our main goal is to prevent suffering, especially for those living in the world’s harshest conditions.”

– Bill Gates

Some experts note that the proposed approach could complicate the fight against climate change, while requiring a rapid response to health protection and food security needs, which creates a balance between priorities.

“There is no greater threat to developing countries than the climate crisis.”

– Michael Mann

In response to Gates’s statements, some scientists and analysts warn of the risks of reducing funding for climate action and advocate for a holistic development approach ahead of COP30.

“Humanity is resilient, and while disasters with large funding will become more frequent and destructive, people will not be wiped out. Still, investments should remain focused on treating diseases and their symptoms – health, hunger, infrastructure, and the preservation of ecosystems.”

– Jennifer Francis

What this means for COP30 and global development

Gates’s new stance pushes for reevaluating the role of investments in global development: the community should view health and food security as part of a strategy to reduce climate risk, but not at the expense of transparent and effective emission reductions. At the same time, experts’ opinions remind of the need to maintain a balance between direct climate actions and supporting people in the most vulnerable regions of the world.

“Realism, not rhetoric, will move us forward,” Mr Ioulianou concludes.","Mr Ioulianou argues that shipping’s route to decarbonisation has been hindered by over-promised targets and under-delivered infrastructure.

“What should have been a co-ordinated global effort toward decarbonisation has resulted in paralysis at the very moment the industry needs clarity and unity,” he said. “The truth is that we are years away from having the global supply chains, bunkering networks, and safety systems needed to support alternative fuels at scale.”

As a result, many shipowners are exercising caution, slowing newbuild orders, delaying investment in future fuels, and extending the life of existing tonnage. “That is not reluctance; it is realism,” Mr Ioulianou added. “Why commit billions to technology that might change next year?”

Industry voices are echoing the call for caution. The CEO of ABS recently urged the energy transition be made “solid and bulletproof” before accelerating further, a message that resonates with shipowners navigating uncertainty around fuel pathways and regulatory timelines.

The debate over LNG underscores that complexity. Once promoted as a bridging fuel, LNG is now under scrutiny for methane leakage and lifecycle emissions. However, as Mr Ioulianou notes, “LNG will remain part of the energy mix for the next 30 or 40 years simply because the infrastructure exists and alternatives are not yet viable.”

Meanwhile, China has emerged as a leader in methanol and ammonia production and shipbuilding, positioning itself at the forefront of future-fuel capability while most other markets remain unprepared to follow at the same pace.

“What we’re seeing isn’t failure, it’s the industry finding its balance,” Mr Ioulianou says. “Net zero by 2050 remains essential, but the path will be slower, costlier, and more complex than policymakers want to admit.”

According to EmissionLink, the next few years should focus less on rapid transition and more on measured, data-driven preparation, developing adaptable fuel strategies, efficient retrofit options, and clear compliance planning.

“Realism, not rhetoric, will move us forward,” Mr Ioulianou concludes. “Between ambition and action lies a vast sea of uncertainty, and it’s in navigating that space that the maritime industry will ultimately find its course.”",http://static1.squarespace.com/static/677d25916da11d07add7c910/677e42da317bf233c28d75a0/6901e1323f7cad3aa3f5f8dc/1761730927255/Emission+Link.jpg?format=1500w,N,,2025-10-29 11:18:00.093548

The agreement would have seen shipping, including cruise lines, adopt targets for reducing emissions internationally with shipowners facing fines unless they operate using progressively cleaner fuels from 2028.

The meeting was intended to approve the deal and finalise the next steps.

However, the US had been increasingly vocal about its objections since April, claiming the deal would lead to price rises for consumers.

US President Trump dismissed the agreement as a “green scam” and threatened to raise trade tariffs on countries supporting it.

In a social media post, he warned: “The United States will NOT stand for this Global Green New Scam Tax on Shipping. We will not tolerate increased prices on American Consumers.”

At the meeting in London, Saudi Arabia proposed adjourning the talks for a year and its motion which was passed by a handful of votes despite the shipping industry backing the deal.

The UK and most EU member states voted to continue talks on an agreement but Greece went against the EU bloc and abstained.

IMO secretary general Arsenio Dominguez issued a plea for a new agreement, but US secretary of state Marco Rubio hailed the outcome as a “huge win”.

Ralph Regenvanu, climate change minister for the island of Vanuatu in the Pacific, criticised the failure to ratify the deal as “unacceptable, given the urgency of accelerating climate change”.

International Chamber of Shipping secretary-general Thomas Kazakos said: “We’re disappointed. The industry needs clarity to make investments.”

The deal followed ten years of negotiations. Shipping accounts for 3% of global emissions but its share is set to rise as other sectors cut emissions.

We were pleased to see constructive discussions on the IMO Net-Zero Fund, ZNZ reward methodology and guidelines related to GHG Fuel Intensity (GFI).","The ISWG-GHG-20 meeting largely resembled business as usual at the IMO, with governments engaging in constructive discussions on the Framework’s guidelines. This was in contrast to chaotic negotiations the week before, which led to the NZF adoption delay.

Countries disagreed on the role of biofuels in shipping’s clean transition, with Brazil, Indonesia and several African countries pushing for a “technology neutral” approach that would favour cheap, existing sources of biofuels, including food and feed stock (e.g. soy and palm oil). This is opposed by the EU and Pacific Island states, who are concerned about sustainability and scalability, and favour renewable e-fuels as a long-term solution.

Researchers, civil society groups and international campaigners have repeatedly warned against the use of food and feed-based biofuels on ships on environmental, climate and human rights grounds, and urge the IMO to disincentivise this fuel option. One way to do this is by considering the full lifecycle of emissions of marine fuels, including accounting of indirect land-use change (ILUC) emissions, in the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) guidelines. This has received the support of Mexico, UK, and several Pacific Islands who also expressed their concerns for addressing food security and environmental sustainability. The LCA guidelines are set to be finalised in April 2026.

Member States and industry expressed broad support for the inclusion of wind propulsion as a zero- or near-zero (ZNZ) energy source alongside solar and shore power, recognizing their contribution to emissions reductions.

Governments also discussed the IMO Net-Zero Fund, which according to experts must be equitable in order to ensure climate-vulnerable countries are not left behind in the transition. The Chair encouraged countries to consolidate their proposals ahead of the next round of negotiations in April.

The US, Saudi Arabia and other oil-producing countries responsible for the NZF adoption delay objected to any further work on the guidelines, deeming it premature until the NZF is adopted. This puzzled several delegates who pointed out that only last week the US and Saudi Arabia argued the NZF cannot be adopted due to key policy clarifications still missing.

Quotes on the record following ISWG-GHG-20:

Dr. Alison Shaw, IMO Policy Manager at T&E, said: “While adoption of the IMO Net-Zero Framework was paused last week, negotiations this week advanced on the implementation guidelines nonetheless. The framework’s success will hinge on strong, coherent guidance that both incentivizes long-term green e-fuel production and use, and safeguards against unsustainable fuels, like crop-based biofuels, with uncaptured environmental impacts. Many member states acknowledged the importance of both aims, though uncertainty over the framework’s eventual adoption remained a clear backdrop to discussions.’”

Natacha Stamatiou, IMO GHG Lead, Global Shipping, Environmental Defense Fund, said: “Last week was undoubtedly challenging, marked by hesitation and differing views on how best to move forward, reflecting the broader tensions we have all been navigating. But the IMO can’t stand still while the world moves forward. Luckily, this week, more voices joined the conversation, and the discussions took on a constructive and more respectful tone. It was a meaningful step toward rebuilding the confidence, transparency, and integrity we need to deliver the pollution cuts future generations deserve.”

Christiaan de Beukelaer, Senior Lecturer in Culture and Climate at the University of Melbourne and an IMO observer,said: “Over the last two weeks, the US, Saudi Arabia and other petro-states engaged in textbook climate obstruction. Last week, they opposed the adoption the Net-Zero Framework for lack of detail. This week, they opposed discussing details ahead of adoption. This Catch-22 of their own making had little impact during IWSG-GHG 20. Under the conciliatory guidance of Working Group Chair Sveinung Oftedahl, the vast majority of delegations in the room worked on ensuring that the IMO can deliver on its unanimously-adopted 2023 GHG Strategy through the Net-Zero Framework. This made the saboteurs sound like a broken record, which the room quietly ignored.”

Jamie Yates, Climate & Renewable Energy Manager, Pacific Environment, said: “Despite last week’s delay tactics and bullying, we’ve moved past obstruction and into real progress with productive discussions now shaping the Net Zero Framework and how it will be implemented. We applaud the member states and industry leaders driving this forward.”

Anaïs Rios, Shipping Policy Officer, Seas At Risk, said: “Wind propulsion is back in the spotlight at the IMO this week, with countries voicing support and industry data strengthening the case. The Net Zero Framework may be delayed but the work hasn’t stopped, and when adoption comes next year, implementation can be quick. Governments must now ensure that these guidelines enable a global scale up of wind propulsion: One of the few solutions that cuts fuel bills, slashes emissions and keeps shipping competitive. The technology is here, now the rules need to catch up.”

Gavin Allwright, Secretary General at International Windship Association (IWSA), said: “With continued advances in wind propulsion, we’re now approaching the 100 large-vessel milestone, representing around 5 million DWT, and the fleet is set to roughly double again within the next 12 months. The technology is proven, scalable, and available globally today. Companies don’t have to wait for international regulation to catch up – they can make a sure bet on wind now and start reaping the benefits of a future-proof, truly zero-cost and zero-emissions energy source.”

Emma Fenton, Senior Diplomacy Director at Opportunity Green, said: “Despite last week’s devastating outcome, countries came together to work on the supporting guidelines that will provide the much-needed clarity on the IMO Net-Zero Framework. We were pleased to see constructive discussions on the IMO Net-Zero Fund, ZNZ reward methodology and guidelines related to GHG Fuel Intensity (GFI). However, with the Net-Zero Framework hanging in the balance, and much more still to be discussed, it is as important as ever for States to prioritise justice and equity in their decision-making, and ultimately, to continue to push for the adoption of the Net-Zero Framework.”

For Trump, climate change is a war on two fronts: against liberals and their values; and against China.
By launching an assault on clean energy both domestically and overseas, Trump is trying to limit China’s global dominance.
Inspired by Trump, and exploiting concerns about inflation and the cost of living, right-wing parties have targeted European countries’ net zero goals and policies.","The proceedings of the Marine Environment Protection Committee of the International Maritime Organization don’t normally make headline news. (Except perhaps in Ocean Freight Times.) But the extraordinary events at the global shipping regulator’s gathering in London this month have shocked the most seasoned observers. Less than a month before the next UN climate conference, COP30, they mark the beginning of a new era in the global politics of climate change.

The IMO is the United Nations agency responsible for the safety and security of shipping and the prevention of the marine and atmospheric pollution it causes. Over the past decade it has been working, somewhat sedately, on a policy to cut the maritime sector’s greenhouse gas emissions. (Shipping contributes just over 2 per cent of global carbon emissions, rising year on year.)

In the past twelve months the IMO had finally reached agreement on two linked measures: a global fuel standard requiring ships gradually to use less-polluting fuels; and a pricing mechanism for the remaining emissions to provide a further incentive to reduce them. The revenues would go to help green the shipping companies, and assist developing countries. The measures had won the support of the global maritime industry, as well as almost all of the IMO’s 176 nation state members.

But not all. At a special environment committee meeting called to ratify the proposal this month, the United States, Russia and Saudi Arabia opposed the measures and called for the vote on them to be postponed. From the White House Donald Trump made clear his views: “The United States will NOT stand for this Global Green New Scam Tax on Shipping…” he declared on Truth Social. “We will not tolerate increased prices on American Consumers OR the creation of a Green New Scam Bureaucracy to spend YOUR money on their Green dreams.”

But it was inside the IMO’s headquarters that Trump really made his presence felt. As delegates considered the motion to delay the decision, US negotiators openly threatened them. A vote against the United States would lead to tariffs being imposed on their countries, they warned, and the individuals themselves would be denied visas to enter the country.

The Trump administration’s bullying tactics were widely decried; but they proved effective. Before the meeting everyone assumed the carbon reduction measures would pass with a large majority. But the meeting ended, as the United States wanted, with the vote put off for a year. It was clear that many countries had changed their positions in the face of the American threats. Industry leaders put a brave face on it, insisting that they would bring the measures back to pass in 2026. But others warned that Washington would only redouble its threats to ensure the measure is killed off.

The dramatic scenes at the IMO opened a new front in the technological struggle that has defined global climate politics for the last two decades: the struggle between fossil fuels and clean energy.

Over the past ten years, clean energy — wind, solar, hydropower and geothermal sources, together with electric vehicles, electric heating and cooling, battery storage and energy efficiency — had finally gained the ascendancy. As a result of huge cost reductions, renewables are now expected to meet over 90 per cent of the growth in global electricity demand over the next five years. Last year Britain became the first major economy to phase out coal-powered generation altogether (a fitting milestone, as it was also the first country to introduce it, in 1882). Globally, perhaps more remarkably, this year or next will see renewables surpassing coal as the world’s primary source of electricity.

Electric car sales in 2024 exceeded seventeen million globally, making up over a fifth of all cars sold. The market has seen extraordinary growth; 3.5 million more electric cars were sold in 2024 than 2023, a number larger than all the electric cars sold in 2020. In China, electric cars accounted for almost half of all car sales last year.

Meanwhile the global battery market is advancing rapidly as demand rises sharply and prices continue to decline. In 2024, the average price of a car battery pack fell below US$100 per kilowatt-hour, the key threshold to compete on cost with petrol-driven rivals.

Politically, too, the tide seemed to be running out on fossil fuels. In 2021, COP26 in Glasgow agreed that coal-fired power should be “phased down,” and twenty-four countries and a number of leading car manufacturers announced they would end the sale of petrol-driven vehicles by 2040. Two years later, in Dubai, COP28 agreed that the world needed to be “transitioning away from fossil fuels” altogether. The official UN press release declared that this represented “the beginning of the end of the fossil fuel era.”

The processes by which clean energy has begun to out-compete fossil fuels have provided a classic example of the technological innovation and “creative destruction” analysed by this year’s winners of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. Jan Mokyr, Philip Aghion and Peter Howitt were jointly awarded the prize this month in recognition of their historical and theoretical work explaining how, through innovation, capitalist economies change their industrial structure and thereby develop.

Up to now the role of governments in this process has been largely to encourage and support the insurgent technologies. Wind and solar power began their modern ascent in the 1990s, when Germany first introduced a “feed-in tariff” to subsidise them. The EU followed, and then other countries (including many American states), with mandates requiring electricity producers to use a minimum proportion of renewables.

Companies responded by innovating, improving the new technologies’ performance and lowering their costs. This allowed policymakers to raise the targets. When China started manufacturing and importing renewables at scale in the 2010s, costs fell even more dramatically. In an effective virtuous circle, the targets were raised again. Today solar and wind power are cheaper than coal almost everywhere in the world; policy is no longer needed.

In vehicles, rising fuel-efficiency standards imposed by governments to control air pollution (and then carbon emissions) first just improved the performance of petrol-driven cars. But around twenty years ago technological innovation brought electric vehicles, or EVs, into the mix. As the standards have been raised and EV costs have fallen, creative destruction has taken its course. On a lifetime cost basis, EVs are expected to become cheaper than internal combustion engine vehicles by 2030.

When Donald Trump was elected president — claiming climate change was a “scam,” pulling the United States out of the Paris Agreement and promising to “drill, baby, drill” in his quest to boost the American oil industry — many observers doubted whether US policy would in reality change that much. The green technology subsidies of Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act were bringing too many new jobs to Republican districts; wind- and solar-powered electricity was so much cheaper than coal; the global oil price was not high enough to incentivise new drilling in the Arctic or national parks. For Trump to bring climate change into the culture wars was one thing, such observers supposed (your own correspondent included); actively damaging the American economy was surely another.

But we underestimated him. For Trump, climate change is a war on two fronts: against liberals and their values; and against China. He has proved himself amply able to sacrifice American businesses and employment in pursuit of his twin aims.

Trump has added a new dynamic to the creative destruction process. He is using the power of the American state, not to support the new technologies, but to promote the old. On his first day in office, he signed an executive order to eliminate EV mandates, and in his landmark “Big Beautiful Bill Act” ended the tax credits that had done much to stimulate EV production and sales. The Environmental Protection Agency proposes to rescind its key 2009 finding that greenhouse gases pose a threat to public health. If it does so, vehicle makers will no longer be required to measure, control or report their greenhouse gas emissions at all.

Last month, meanwhile, the US government said it would open thirteen million acres of federal lands for coal mining and provide $625 million to recommission and modernise coal-fired power plants. It has frozen permits for offshore wind projects, ended clean energy tax credits and blocked wind and solar developments on federal lands. This month the administration cancelled $7.6 billion in grants that supported hundreds of clean energy projects in sixteen states (all of them run by the Democrats). Although the Inflation Reduction Act has not been formally repealed, most of its green technology provisions have been terminated.

Energy demand in America is now soaring as the exponential growth of AI data centres sucks in ever more electricity to power them. Just a few years ago Google, Microsoft and Meta all committed to achieve net zero power consumption by 2030, and Amazon by 2040. But these targets are now under threat. US coal consumption, long thought to be in terminal decline, is now set to rise by 7 per cent next year. As one environmental analyst put it, “it’s a steampunk dystopia — bloated, coal-fired data centres in an ever-warmer world.”

Trump is not limiting his fossil fuel drive to the US. He is also using trade and defence deals to pressure countries in Europe and Asia to buy more American gas under decades-long contracts. In its bid to reduce the tariffs Trump imposed, the European Union has committed to import up to A$1.15 trillion of US energy — mostly liquefied natural gas, or LNG — by 2028, more than four times its current imports. Similarly, Indonesia has signed up for A$24 billion in US energy imports. Japan is negotiating a similar deal. Australia is next in line.

Why is Trump doing this? His ideological antipathy to environmentalism and environmentalists is clear. But economically, his target is China. Over the past decade, China has become the global superpower in the manufacture of green technologies. It now controls more than 70 per cent of global solar, wind and battery manufacturing. Chinese-made electric vehicles are now much cheaper — and higher-quality — than Western brands: BYD this year overtook Tesla as the world’s largest electric and hybrid vehicle manufacturer.

As global demand for renewable energy and EVs rises, the Chinese economy grows stronger. By launching an assault on clean energy both domestically and overseas, Trump is trying to limit China’s global dominance.

He is already having some success. Major car manufacturers in Europe, including Audi, Volvo and Porsche, have announced they are slowing their shift to EVs or even abandoning them altogether. Lobbied on all sides by worried manufacturing industries facing higher energy costs and Chinese competition, the EU is engaged in a painful process of weakening its carbon targets and regulations. Inspired by Trump, and exploiting concerns about inflation and the cost of living, right-wing parties have targeted European countries’ net zero goals and policies. Public support for climate action in Europe remains high, but governments are increasingly nervous. Having already delayed its EV targets, the British government is considering pushing back its flagship pledge to achieve net zero power by 2030.",https://insidestory.org.au/wp-content/uploads/trump_maritime.jpg,N,,2025-10-29 02:16:43.351021

Ships that would be subject to the proposed regulation use 70 to 80 billion gallons of fuel per year globally.

“Even if U.S. ethanol captured just five per cent of the global maritime fuel market, it would equate to a game-changing demand boost of four to five billion gallons, while simultaneously increasing corn demand by 1.5 billion bushels or more,” said Cooper.

To put that in perspective, total U.S. ethanol production was 16.1 billion gallons last year.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture is forecasting a price-depressing 2.11 billion bushels of U.S. corn carryout in 2025-26.

Ethanol demand from the maritime sector could mop up much of that excess if the proposed regulation is adopted.

“It’s not hard to understand what sort of impact that would have on prices for farmers,” said Cooper.

It would also boost demand and prices for American sorghum and soybeans.

“There is huge potential in this for Canadian agriculture as well,” he said.

Ian Thomson, past president of Advanced Biofuels Canada, agrees with that assessment.

“It’s a really significant new market for biofuels,” he said.

Ships can run on 100 per cent biodiesel or ethanol, while on-road fuels are limited to biodiesel blends of five to 20 per cent and ethanol blends of up to 15 per cent.

“That’s why people in the biofuel sector are looking at maritime fuels as a really big new market,” said Thomson.

That new source of demand could bring idled biofuel plants back into production, he said. There is a lot of excess capacity in North America.

Biofuel and other low-carbon alternatives comprise far less than one per cent of maritime fuel needs today. An estimated 93 per cent is petroleum-based fuel oil and diesel/gas oil, while six per cent is liquified natural gas (LNG).

Ships using U.S. ethanol, biodiesel and renewable diesel would “easily comply” with the IMO’s proposed standards, which were set to take effect in 2027 and last through 2038.

The IMO met in mid-October to vote on the proposal but decided to delay the vote for another year due to push back from some groups, including U.S. president Donald Trump’s administration.

Cooper said the Trump administration incorrectly believes the IMO framework would exclude proven technologies such as LNG and biofuel.

“We don’t see it that way,” he said.

“According to (the U.S. Department of Energy’s) own analysis, U.S. ethanol — the lowest-cost alternative fuel available at scale worldwide — would be an incredibly competitive marine fuel option under the program.”

That DOE analysis shows U.S. corn ethanol would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 61 per cent compared to traditional fossil-based marine fuels, while U.S soy biodiesel and renewable diesel would reduce emissions by 66 and 60 per cent, respectively.

Cooper said the U.S. biofuel sector needs to spend the next year “connecting the dots” for U.S. policymakers, impressing upon them what a “remarkable new market opportunity” this is for American farmers.

He hopes the U.S. delegation will vote in favour of the proposed framework when the IMO reconvenes next October.

If that happens, he expects the new regulation to be implemented in 2028, one year after the original plan.

Cooper thinks ethanol would immediately benefit from the regulation because it has the infrastructure to store and move the fuel anywhere it needs to go, including storage facilities at seaports.

The U.S. exported 1.85 billion gallons of the fuel in 2024.

Thomson said there is not much lobbying that needs to take place in Canada. Ottawa knows the biofuel sector supports the proposed framework, and the Canadian delegation voted in favour of it at the October meeting.",https://static.producer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/28135926/212308_web1_HDM080211portvancouver.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 17:16:28.816771

“It also showcases Everllence’s capability to deliver large-scale retrofit projects.”

Everllence, formerly MAN, believes there are more than 300 vessels with its S90-class engines that are suitable for retrofitting.

“While the journey toward full decarbonisation will require collaboration across the industry, this achievement demonstrates that large-scale conversions are both technically proven and commercially viable,” added Petersen.

A New Chapter in Marine Propulsion

Rolls-Royce has achieved a breakthrough in maritime decarbonization with the successful test of the world’s first high-speed marine engine powered entirely by methanol. The test, conducted at the company’s Friedrichshafen facility, is part of the German-funded meOHmare research initiative, a collaboration between Rolls-Royce Power Systems, Woodward L’Orange, and the technology institute WTZ Roßlau.

“This is a genuine world first,” said Dr. Jörg Stratmann, CEO of Rolls-Royce Power Systems AG. “To date, there is no other high-speed engine in this performance class that runs purely on methanol. We are investing in future technologies that allow our customers to reduce CO₂ emissions and expand our leadership in sustainable propulsion systems.”

The test marks a critical step toward climate-neutral maritime transport — an industry responsible for roughly 3% of global emissions and under rising regulatory pressure to decarbonize.

Engineering Innovation for a New Fuel

Methanol, long viewed as a key contender in the transition to cleaner marine fuels, brings distinct engineering challenges. Unlike diesel, it does not ignite spontaneously, requiring a complete redesign of combustion systems.

“We have fundamentally redesigned the combustion process, turbocharging, and engine control system — and even adapted our test bench infrastructure,” said Dr. Johannes Kech, Head of Methanol Engine Development at Rolls-Royce Power Systems. “Initial tests show the engine is running smoothly; now we focus on fine-tuning.”

By the end of 2025, the meOHmare consortium plans to deliver a comprehensive concept for a CO₂-neutral marine engine powered by green methanol, derived through renewable-energy-based power-to-X production processes.

From Research to Market Readiness

The test also serves as a signal to the broader shipping and energy industries. “Green methanol is a future-oriented fuel — and the technology for it is here,” said Denise Kurtulus, Senior Vice President Global Marine at Rolls-Royce. “This engine is an attractive solution, especially for operators of ferries, yachts, or supply vessels who want to reduce their carbon footprint. The task now is to create the right framework for wider adoption.”

Rolls-Royce is simultaneously developing dual-fuel systems that can operate on both methanol and diesel — a transitional solution aimed at maintaining flexibility until renewable methanol production scales up. The company sees methanol’s ease of storage, biodegradability, and low pollutant profile as major advantages over ammonia or hydrogen-based alternatives.

Global and Industry Context

Methanol’s appeal lies in its balance of practicality and sustainability. When produced from renewable electricity and captured CO₂, green methanol can achieve near-zero lifecycle emissions. The fuel is already gaining traction in shipping: Maersk has ordered over two dozen methanol-fueled vessels, while ports from Singapore to Rotterdam are establishing bunkering infrastructure.

For engine manufacturers like Rolls-Royce, the challenge lies not only in technical innovation but also in aligning with evolving international standards and decarbonization frameworks, including the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) target to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.

Germany’s involvement through public funding reflects Europe’s strategic intent to secure leadership in clean marine technologies — an industrial and geopolitical priority as global competition for green shipping solutions intensifies.

C-Suite Takeaway: Decarbonization Meets Deployment

The success of Rolls-Royce’s methanol engine prototype strengthens the company’s position within a rapidly shifting propulsion market. For ship operators and investors, it underscores growing momentum toward scalable low-emission technologies that align with tightening carbon regulations and investor expectations.

If successfully commercialized, the technology could accelerate the maritime sector’s transition away from fossil fuels, providing a tangible path to meet climate commitments while maintaining operational performance.

Smith, who specialises in global shipping decarbonisation, stresses that the IMO cannot achieve its pledge to reach net zero by 2050 without paying a price.
He believes that the impacts of climate change on food security, migration and many more problems far exceed the economic costs of the shipping framework.","Negotiators from across the world met in London this month at the UN shipping agency’s headquarters to adopt landmark rules to reduce the sector’s carbon emissions.

Though the rules had been agreed on in April, the meeting at the International Maritime Organization (IMO) ended with deep division and the plans delayed for at least a year. The week-long talks witnessed complaints of intimidation and some delegates brought to tears.

Delegates said the meeting turned into a political battleground, with the US issuing public threats to nations supporting curbs on emissions. Some nations backtracked on their support for tough regulations to make shipowners pay for high-emitting vessels, and instead supported Saudi Arabia’s ultimately successful moves to delay the plans.

But this was not just about rich fossil-fuel-producing countries scuppering curbs on oil use. Some developing nations voiced fears that the IMO’s plans would spike food prices for their citizens. They said they supported decarbonisation but had not been assured the money raised by the levy would ensure an equitable transition away from oil.

The shipping industry burns 350 million tonnes of fuel oil every year as it moves over 80% of goods traded worldwide, producing 3% of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions in the process. Advocates for the IMO’s regulations to change this have vowed to address key sticking points and come back next year to try again.

At the IMO in London, overlooking the River Thames, Dialogue Earth spoke with delegates and observers across the debating chamber and bustling lunch-hour canteen – documenting the meeting’s highs and lows. Then, after the unexpected denouement, we asked them if there is a path forward for the net-zero plans.

A plan to move away from fossil fuels

Shipping is under huge pressure to move away from fossil fuels, especially from governments in countries threatened by climate change such as the Pacific island nations, and from Europe, where the European Union has introduced its own shipping-emission rules.

In 2023, IMO member states unanimously agreed to achieve net-zero emissions from the sector “by or around” 2050. To meet this pledge, a Net-Zero Framework was proposed to incentivise investments into greener marine fuels; construction of greener ships; and upgrades of existing vessels and ports to use fuels like green methanol and green ammonia.

The framework set out rules for vessels to reduce their greenhouse gas intensity, meaning their emissions per unit of energy used. Vessels failing to meet the base intensity target would face charges, starting at USD 100 per tonne of CO2 equivalent.

Those failing short of an even more lenient threshold would face a higher rate under the framework: USD 380 per tonne on emissions exceeding the base target. Vessels that overperform and are more efficient than required could earn “surplus units” and trade these with other ships. Any payments collected would go into a Net-Zero Fund to mitigate impacts of climate change on developing states and reward low-emission ships.

‘Unexpectedly challenging’

The overarching framework was approved in April by a large majority of nations: 63 backed it, 16 were opposed and 24 abstained. Despite strong opposition from the US, many of these countries appeared to have maintained their support heading into this month’s talks – which were supposed to consider some changes to the text and give it a final sign-off. This gave proponents early confidence that adoption was within reach.

The official adoption would mean writing the new rules into the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (Marpol). The plan was set to come into force in 2027 and be fully operational in 2028. But the outcome of this month’s meeting means it could instead be pushed back or even abandoned entirely.

Anita Mäkinen, one of Finland’s representatives to the IMO said she entered the first session on 14 October aware that the geopolitics could threaten the adoption. “But I never really thought it could be this challenging.”

Finland is part of a group of EU countries pushing for the deal, alongside other vocal proponents such as Brazil and some Pacific island countries including Tuvalu.

Their initial optimism faded midweek, when the negotiations grew increasingly tense. At one point, tension ran so high the meeting’s chair tried to cut it by asking if there was a doctor in the room.

Delegates from the US and Saudi Arabia made attempts to stall the proceedings. Their tactics ranged from challenging the plan’s adoption to proposing the IMO should require governments’ explicit acceptance for adoption, which would go against the usual IMO approach of assuming acceptance of negotiation outcomes. Meanwhile, more nations expressed doubts about the adoption as the week went on.

Country’s that had previously voted to approve the framework – including China, India and Kenya – supported delaying a vote on the adoption, while major shipping nations such as Greece and Cyprus abstained. On the final day of the meeting, 17 October, countries voted 57 to 49 in favour of delaying, with 21 abstentions.

The delay has confused a sector that plans shipbuilding years in advance. “Industry needs clarity to be able to make the investments needed to decarbonise the maritime sector,” said Thomas Kazakos, secretary general of the International Chamber of Shipping.

Pressure from the US

Many delegates attributed the outcome to the US officials’ campaign to derail the framework. This included threats before the meeting to impose visa restrictions on mariners from nations that supported the deal, additional fees if ships from those nations docked at US ports, and even sanctions on officials from countries supporting what the US called “a global carbon tax on Americans”.

Delegates from a Pacific island nation told Dialogue Earth that the capitals of several Pacific states received pressure from high-level US officials, urging them to withdraw support. Mäkinen shared a similar observation, saying the targets for US lobbying were small island states and “big flag states” where large numbers of ships are registered. Many delegates could be seen huddling in private discussions on the IMO hall floor.

“There was so much politics involved and that’s why it was extraordinary,” Mäkinen adds. “We couldn’t discuss and negotiate only on the basis of technical issues of the proposed regulations.”

Leaving no one behind

US coercion was not the only concern, however. Representatives from developing countries, including small island nations from the Pacific and the Caribbean, raised questions about the framework’s impact on shipping costs and food security.

During coffee breaks, Dialogue Earth spoke to several chatty delegates in the buzzing main chamber. They said they were troubled by a lack of clarity on the Net Zero Fund’s distribution and how it could help offset the framework’s negative impacts. A study estimates that USD 11-12 billion could be raised annually by the framework between 2028 and 2030, but the implementation guidelines that address revenue-sharing are still under discussion.

Benoit Bardouille, Dominica’s ambassador and adviser to its prime minister, said that his Caribbean state, which is moving toward 100% renewable energy by 2030, supports the shipping sector being decarbonised, “but it must be done with a certain level of soberness”.

Bardouille, who represented his state at the IMO meeting, said many Caribbean states are heavily reliant on imports. He fears the framework will raise shipping costs, leading to spiralling inflation that is passed onto consumers.

Pawa Limu, Papua New Guinea’s delegate, shared similar concerns. Both Bardouille and Limu want more clarity on how money raised by the IMO scheme will be shared to drive a fair and just transition away from fossil fuels – one that doesn’t leave vulnerable states behind.

Tristan Smith, a professor of energy and transport at University College London, said such worries are “very legitimate”. This year his research group estimated that transportation costs for global trade could rise by around 5% in 2028 to at least 20% by 2035, depending on how strict the rules become.

Much of the transition is predicated on shipping that runs on relatively cheap oil shifting in a significant fashion to more expensive but greener fuels such as green hydrogen, methanol and ammonia.

Smith, who specialises in global shipping decarbonisation, stresses that the IMO cannot achieve its pledge to reach net zero by 2050 without paying a price. “You always have inflationary effects because we’re … moving from a low-cost energy source to a higher cost energy source,” he said. “The low-cost energy source has high environmental costs, but in our economy today, we don’t put a price on those costs.”

Lloyd Fikiasi, a delegate from Vanuatu – the Pacific nation known for championing climate actions – said those unpriced costs should not be underestimated.

“We look beyond those economic impacts. It’s [a matter of] survival. If we don’t take any actions to address greenhouse gas emissions, we will lose our future,” said Fikiasi.

He believes that the impacts of climate change on food security, migration and many more problems far exceed the economic costs of the shipping framework. Vanuatu abstained on the approval of the plan in April, as it said the framework is not ambitious enough to meet the IMO’s net-zero target.

Advocates remain hopeful

After the vote to delay the framework, member states continued discussions in London on implementation guidelines. These will dictate critical elements of the plan including how the Net-Zero Fund will operate and how low-carbon marine fuels will be certified.

Proponents hope that discussions such as these before the next crunch vote on the overall framework will help resolve the outstanding concerns.

Smith remains confident that a majority of the IMO member nations support the framework, even though many want more time and clarity on specific elements, or adjustments to how it will work. Fikiasi is less certain, and worries that geopolitics could still stymie agreement next year.

Mäkinen said she remains hopeful even though she too doubts that the political pressure seen this month will disappear in a year.

“I have experienced many negotiations [in which] I wasn’t exactly sure where we would end up. But they always have a happy ending we could agree on,” she said. “I have trust in the IMO miracles.”",https://dialogue.earth/content/uploads/2025/10/Container-ship-moving-through-Panama-Csnall_Alamy_3CMJMMW_THUMBNAIL.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 14:56:13.109917

Quadrise PLC (AIM:QED) CEO Peter Borup talked with Proactive's Stephen Gunnion about how the recent delay by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) to finalise its net-zero framework is impacting the global shipping industry and the commercial prospects of Quadrise’s cleaner fuel alternatives, MSAR and BioMSAR.

Borup said the delay has introduced more uncertainty for shipowners and regulators alike but stressed that it also opens space for independent action. “You can actually go pretty far and you can save some money at the same time,” he noted, pointing to immediate solutions including hull paint, rotor sails, and Quadrise’s own products that reduce both emissions and costs.

He also addressed the impact of lacking a global carbon pricing mechanism until 2027, saying that cleaner fuels like MSAR and BioMSAR still offer a compelling value proposition due to their economic and emissions advantages.

Borup highlighted growing opportunities within the European Union's Emissions Trading Scheme, with players already selling carbon credits at over €300 per tonne to global buyers such as Microsoft.

While the IMO delay may appear as a hurdle, Borup suggested it could also be beneficial, stating, “It could be in our favour,” provided Quadrise can scale adoption quickly. He emphasised the importance of a level playing field for shipowners across jurisdictions.

It has been widely reported as an unequivocal indication of divided sentiments over stepped-up environmental control of global shipping.

According to Asia Shipping Media (ASM), it has unsettled regulators, particularly in Europe.

The European Commission has expressed frustration at Greece and Cyprus’s decision to abstain from voting on whether to defer the NZF.

During the Marine Environment Protection Committee’s extraordinary session in London on October 18, delegates voted to postpone discussions for 12 months after failing to reach a consensus or call a vote on the draft amendments to Marine Pollution (MarPol) Annex VI, which contains the framework’s key provisions.

As a result, the shipping industry now faces significantly greater uncertainty and, consequently, heightened risk.

The decision delays any potential adoption of the NZF until late 2026 at the earliest, complicating the timeline for achieving the organisation’s greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction strategy agreed in 2023.

The framework, which was approved in principle at the Marine Environment Protection Committee’s 83rd session in April, provides a detailed description of a global fuel standard and an emissions pricing mechanism.

Together, the two regulations strive to enable net-zero achievement for global shipping by 2050.

Analysts at consultancy Linerlytica have produced a map illustrating how member states voted during this month’s session at the IMO’s London headquarters, revealing a pronounced divide over the NZF.

University College London (UCL) has said that while it is now certain the framework’s entry into force will be delayed by 12 months to January 1, 2029, doubts remain as to whether it will be adopted at all.

Dr Tristan Smith, Professor of Energy and Transport at UCL’s Shipping and Oceans Research Group, observed that instead of providing clarity, the outcome had left the shipping industry, and the wider trade and energy systems, facing increased uncertainty and risk. He argued that understanding the dynamics behind the October meeting was now crucial, not only for any future adoption of the framework but also for ensuring equitable and effective climate action.

Smith added that while lost momentum could still be recovered, the setback brought the world closer to the brink of dangerous climate change.

ASM adds that analysts at investment bank Jefferies suggested that one possible consequence of the indecision could be a renewed focus on conventional fuel engines for new vessel orders, as well as for many ships currently under construction.

The bank indicated that many shipowners might opt to convert their dual-fuel ‘capable’ newbuilds into dual-fuel ‘ready’ configurations to reduce capital expenditure, particularly for deliveries scheduled from 2027 onwards, when engine changes remain feasible.

Jefferies further noted that if there were any advantage to the IMO’s stalled initiatives, it might be a reduction in overall shipping costs.

The Sustainable Shipping Initiative (SSI) stated that the vote had exposed several vulnerabilities within the IMO, including growing politicisation in its decision-making processes and an increasingly fragmented regional consensus.

The SSI added that national administrations’ responses, the development of regional regulations, and the signals these sent to financial markets seeking long-term clarity could all had wide-reaching implications for the sector.",https://www.freightnews.co.za/files/styles/article_large/public/article/headline/2025-10/6-ag.jpg?itok=DbkQuk0q,N,,2025-10-28 11:16:48.920743

Once a week, bunker intelligence platform ENGINE will publish a snapshot of alternative and conventional bunker fuel prices in the world’s two biggest bunkering hubs. The following is the latest snapshot:

Rotterdam’s B100 at wider discounts to conventional fuels

LBM rises against LNG in Rotterdam

EUA costs fall for fossil fuels

Rotterdam’s HBE-rebated B100 benchmark has dropped to $24-33/mt greater discounts to HSFO, VLSFO and LSMGO for voyages between EU ports. It is now priced $139/mt, $160/mt and $328/mt lower than these grades, respectively.

Singapore’s B100 UCOME benchmark is at hefty premiums over conventional fuels for voyages between Singapore (a non-EU port) and EU ports. Its premiums over HSFO and VLSFO have narrowed by $14-18/mt on the week to $544/mt and $481/mt, respectively. Its premium over LSMGO has plunged $53/mt lower to $286/mt.

Rotterdam’s LNG has dropped by $15/mt in the past week. That has moved it to smaller premiums of $46/mt over HSFO and $25/mt over VLSFO for dual-fuel vessels with Otto medium speed (Otto MS) engines. But compared to LSMGO, LNG is now $143/mt cheaper.

Singapore’s LNG has narrowed its premium over VLSFO to $50/mt, and to $113/mt over HSFO. Its discount to LSMGO is $145/mt.

For vessels with diesel slow speed (diesel SS) engines, Rotterdam’s LNG is at wide discounts of $93/mt to HSFO, $114/mt to VLSFO and $282/mt to LSMGO. This is because these engines have much lower methane slip than Otto MS ones and are therefore less penalised by the EU.

In Singapore, LNG diesel SS is priced $43/mt over HSFO, while at discounts of $20/mt to VLSFO and $215/mt to LSMGO.

Rotterdam’s liquefied biomethane (LBM) is $147/mt cheaper than LNG for a vessel with an Otto MS engine, and $151/mt cheaper than LNG for a diesel SS engine vessel.

Liquid fuels

Rotterdam’s HSFO and VLSFO prices are down by $4-6/mt on the week for EU-EU voyages. A $29/mt drop in EU Emission Allowance (EUA) costs for these fuels, and a $1/mt drop in FuelEU Maritime penalties have countered rises in their outright prices.

B100 has gained $27/mt in Rotterdam, as its assessed pooling value has increased by $15/mt to $661/mt, and as the outright B100 price has jumped $42/mt higher on the week.

In Singapore, HSFO and VLSFO prices have edged $4-6/mt higher, while its LSMGO price has pushed $43/mt higher. Singapore’s B100 price has gained $8/mt.

Liquid gases

LNG has shed $15/mt to $565-704/mt in Rotterdam for EU-EU voyages, and by $10-11/mt to $565-634/mt in Singapore for non-EU to EU voyages. The price spreads depend on engine types and methane slips.

The LNG prices have dropped amid $26/mt declines in EUA costs for LNG consumed between EU ports, and a $13/mt drop between non-EU and EU ports.

Rotterdam and Singapore’s outright LNG prices have gained slightly on the week amid slight upticks in TTF and JKM gas prices, and a larger assessed bunker delivery premium in Rotterdam.

LBM is up by $10-11/mt on the week to $415-557/mt in Rotterdam, depending on engine type.

LNG bunker fuel supplier Titan on Thursday (23 October) said it has completed the first delivery of liquefied biomethane (LBM/bio-LNG) to a Brittany Ferries vessel.

Hybrid-LNG ferry Saint-Malo received the supply during one of its recent regular bunker calls in Portsmouth International Port with Titan’s bunkering vessel Optimus.

“This hybrid ferry operates on LNG, battery power or a combination to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. With this LBM delivery, Titan is proud to support the sustainability goals of yet another customer who chooses to lead rather than wait,” Titan said in a social media post.

The company said LBM delivers overcompliance with the FuelEU Maritime regulation, presenting benefits via pooling, banking and borrowing.

“Pooling allows operators to combine over- and under-compliant ships’ balances, so the pool offsets individual deficits or surpluses. Banking involves carrying surplus over to the next year. Borrowing means using next year’s surplus early, with interest,” it added.

LBM can also be ‘dropped into’ all established LNG bunkering infrastructure, including LNG-fuelled ships, and blended with LNG or e-methane at any ratio – with no vessel modification required. This flexibility enables operators to pursue initial emissions reductions through LNG and by introducing biomethane in line with their voluntary and regulatory emissions targets.

“Our latest LNG and LBM bunkering operation highlights that the methane decarbonisation pathway is not a future promise; it is already delivering environmental performance today,” Titan added.

Molgas Energy Group (Molgas), backed by infrastructure investor InfraVia, recently finalised the full acquisition of Titan Energy Holding, parent company of Titan Clean Fuels (Titan).

Nordic energy company Gasum on Thursday (23 October) said its fleet of gas-powered bunkering and carrier vessels have, for some time now, operated entirely on liquefied biogas (bio-LNG).

With this move, Gasum’s vessels have already generated a generous amount of compliance for the company’s FuelEU Maritime pool.

Gasum’s fleet comprises two bunkering vessels, delivering LNG and bio-LNG to ships at ports, as well as two carrier vessels that transport liquefied gas across the Nordics and Northern Europe. Each vessel is equipped with a dual-fuel gas engine, enabling the use of renewable bio-LNG as fuel.

By powering its own chartered vessels with bio-LNG Gasum is able to provide flexibility to the pool’s balance as the year is nearing its end and more regulation surplus is demanded.

“As we are now in the last quarter of the first FuelEU Maritime regulation year, there’s never been a more critical moment for ship owners to act. Joining Gasum’s FuelEU Maritime pool is the easiest and most reliable way to secure compliance. Adding our own fleet to the pool as compliance generators helps to secure more compliance surplus, but the amount is still limited”, said Jacob Granqvist, Vice President, Maritime, Gasum.

Gasum’s gas carrier vessels are chartered from Anthony Veder, who is also an offtaker in Gasum’s FuelEU Maritime pool. One of Gasum’s bunker vessels, Coralius, is jointly owned by Anthony Veder and Sirius Shipping. Gasum’s other bunker vessel, Kairos, is owned by Bernhard Schulte.

In addition to Gasum’s own vessels the pool includes other partners that are able to generate surplus with dual-fuel ships. By using bio-LNG across several gas-powered vessels, Gasum generates surplus emission reductions that can then be allocated to other ships in the pool.

The future of green shipping will be built, not negotiated.”","The International Maritime Organization’s decision to postpone a global carbon-pricing framework has drawn sharp criticism from industry leaders who say the energy transition at sea is already well underway.

At its extraordinary session held in London from 14–17 October 2025, the IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC/ES.2) voted to delay for one year the adoption of amendments to MARPOL Annex VI, which would have established the world’s first global carbon-pricing mechanism for shipping.

The decision represents a setback for international decarbonisation efforts, effectively maintaining the status quo for fossil fuel producers. Yet, for those already investing in clean-energy solutions—such as shipowners, ports, and private investors—the momentum toward zero-emission shipping is proving irreversible.

NatPower Marine, a major developer of maritime electrification infrastructure, says the industry cannot afford to wait.

“The IMO’s postponement is disappointing, but it cannot be a pause button,” said Stefano D.M. Sommadossi, CEO of NatPower Marine and NatPower UK. “Shore power and near-shore electrification are proven, scalable, and capable of delivering deep emissions cuts today. Every corridor we electrify removes thousands of tonnes of CO₂, NOₓ, and SOₓ while improving air quality for coastal communities. The opportunity to lead is now, not in a year’s time.”

Innovation Leading Regulation

Sommadossi argues that technological innovation has always outpaced regulation—from aviation and automotive to AI—and shipping is no different.

“The most innovative operators have already decided to go green because it’s both a strategic advantage and a cost-saving measure. While policymakers debate, the industry is building,” he said.

NatPower Marine is pressing ahead with its plan to deliver near-shore electric propulsion and cold ironing infrastructure at 120 global locations. The company expects to invest more than £3 billion by 2030 to establish a connected network of zero-emission maritime energy hubs.

Emerging economies may lose out from the delay, Sommadossi noted, as they were counting on a global carbon-pricing system to fund sustainable port investments. However, private capital could still bridge that gap if projects are included within the growing web of green shipping corridors.

The Rise of Green Corridors

Across Europe, Asia, and the Americas, ports are rapidly electrifying, with clean energy corridors linking high-traffic routes. NatPower Marine’s Heysham–Northern Ireland corridor, built in partnership with Peel Ports Group, is already under construction and will eliminate over 10,000 tonnes of CO₂ annually from Irish Sea routes.

Sommadossi said the IMO delay only underscores the need for regional action. The EU Emissions Trading System, FuelEU Maritime, the UK ETS, Singapore’s corridor initiatives, and California’s at-berth emissions rules are already shaping the next phase of maritime decarbonisation.

“Global consensus is ideal, but regional regulation is getting the job done,” he said. “Decarbonisation is no longer waiting for a single mechanism—it’s happening route by route, port by port.”

Ports as the Catalyst

Recent findings from the World Maritime University (WMU) and Shanghai International Shipping Institute (SISI) confirm that ports are becoming central to green shipping transitions. Their Global Green Shipping Development Report (2024–2025) projects that shore power will soon become mandatory in many jurisdictions as emission standards tighten.

“This global trend validates our approach,” Sommadossi said. “Shore power and e-charging infrastructure are not optional—they’re the foundation of clean shipping. Every port that plugs into our network becomes part of the global energy transition.”

Building the Backbone of Clean Shipping

NatPower Marine’s network is supported by the broader NatPower Group, which provides 20 GW of renewable generation and over 100 GWh of battery storage. These assets, strategically located near coastlines, ensure clean power delivery to vessels through private-wire systems and smart PPAs—reducing grid pressure while enabling true zero-emission operations.

Sommadossi calls this integration “the backbone of a clean-shipping network,” linking renewable power generation directly to port and vessel demand.

A Redefinition of Green Corridors

He also called for a broader understanding of what defines a “green corridor.”

“Most have focused on fuel alternatives like e-methanol or ammonia,” he said. “But a truly green corridor must include the full chain—shore power, propulsion charging, renewable generation, and grid integration. That’s how we deliver zero-emission voyages from berth to berth at scale.”

While policymakers take another year to negotiate global consensus, Sommadossi believes the race toward clean shipping is already being won by those who act.

“If this week proved anything,” he concluded, “it’s that we cannot wait for definitions or delays. The future of green shipping will be built, not negotiated.”",https://www.globaltrademag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/shutterstock_2456182077-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 11:17:08.250092

But under the complex rules of the world’s shipping regulator, that vote had to be reaffirmed at a further meeting this week.

For months, the US — which walked out of the April talks — put pressure on other countries to reject the move. In the past fortnight, this was stepped up to what some countries said amounted to an unprecedented campaign against them.

The US threatened countries and individual officials, with tariffs, penalties and visa revocations if they supported the pricing mechanism.

Dr Simon Bullock, a research fellow at the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research at the University of Manchester, said: “Yet again, powerful fossil fuel states are successfully blocking global efforts to cooperate on climate change. This is not the result the industry wanted, nor one the world’s people can afford. Progressive shipping businesses and nations can still chart a course to a clean shipping future, but Mr Trump’s aggressive, destructive lobbying has made their job much harder.”

Meanwhile, some petrostates including Saudi Arabia held out the offer of sweeteners to countries that voted against the plan, which has been several years in the making.

In the final tally, 57 countries voted in favour of delay, with 49 countries against delaying and 21 abstentions. In April, the measure had passed with the support of 63 member states and 16 countries against, though the US walked out and 24 countries abstained.

Ralph Regenvanu, Vanuatu’s climate minister, expressed the frustration of many small developing nations: “This is unacceptable given the urgency we face in light of accelerating climate change.”

After Friday’s vote, countries will have to reconvene in a year to consider the proposal again. The delay means uncertainty and confusion for companies involved in shipping and in the global trade in many key commodities.

John Maggs, of the Clean Shipping Coalition, said: “By delaying adoption of its net-zero framework, the IMO has today squandered an important opportunity to tackle global shipping’s contribution to climate breakdown. With climate warming impacts being felt everywhere on earth, kicking this decision down the road is simply evading reality. Governments serious about climate action must spend the next 12 months rallying every nation that supports the framework, convincing those who are on the fence, or opposing, that its adoption is the only sane way forward.”

Even if the measure is agreed next year, it will take years to come into force, as IMO rules mean it must be subject to a further period of technical assessment and review of how it can be implemented. That could mean a delay until near the end of this decade, at least.

Experts estimate the carbon levy as planned could raise $10bn a year, but to the disappointment of many small countries most of any potential revenues would remain within the shipping industry. Much of the money would be used to help companies upgrade their vessels and move to lower carbon fuels, or to pay for modifications to ports, rather than be allocated to poor countries to help them cope with the impacts of the climate crisis, as many had hoped.

If it is eventually passed, the measure is not likely to place significant costs on imported goods, despite the concerns of some exporting countries.

Shipping represents about 3 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions, but that is forecast to rise to 10 per cent by mid-century. The IMO has been working on various plans to reduce carbon from shipping for the last two decades, but progress has been slow.

The extraordinary scenes at the IMO, where discussions are normally staid and highly technical, bodes ill for further talks on ways to raise the revenues needed for poor countries to deal with the impacts of extreme weather, which will be continued at the Cop30 UN climate summit in Brazil next month.

Anaïs Rios, senior shipping policy officer at the green campaigning organisation Seas at Risk, said: “Emotions have run high this week at the IMO, with once high-ambitious alliances wavering and strategies eclipsing reason. No single flag should dictate the world’s climate course. With countries like Saudi Arabia leading efforts to delay, few expected a postponement to prevail, but here we are. What matters now is that countries rise up and come back to the IMO with a louder and more confident yes vote that cannot be silenced. The planet does not have time to waste.”",https://www.nationalobserver.com/sites/default/files/img/2025/10/26/7720563568_908f5c7b9c_h.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 06:16:29.547463

The report by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) said China, India and Indonesia, the three largest coal growth markets and top drivers of global CO2 emissions since the Paris Agreement, are now on track to peak power sector emissions by 2030, provided they sustain their clean energy momentum.

Together, these countries accounted for 73 per cent of global coal consumption in 2024.

According to the study, India's clean electricity growth has accelerated sharply, with a record 29 gigawatt (GW) of non-fossil capacity added in 2024 and 25 GW more in the first half of 2025.

""Meeting India's 500 GW of non-fossil power capacity set by Prime Minister (Narendra) Modi could in fact peak coal power before 2030. The country has already crossed the 50 per cent mark well ahead of its 2030 deadline, even as electricity demand continues to rise in line with rapid economic and population growth.

""Strengthening grid flexibility, storage and transmission will be key to sustaining this momentum and ensuring reliable, affordable electricity,"" said Manoj Kumar, Analyst at CREA.

India's national policy framework, driven by competitive renewable energy auctions and ambitious manufacturing targets, has transformed it into a fast-growing solar manufacturing hub, the report said.

The country's annual solar module capacity stood at 118 GW by mid-2025 and is projected to reach 200 GW by 2028, reducing import dependence and supporting its clean energy goals.

CREA said China has already achieved a milestone by adding enough new clean electricity generation to cover all new demand growth.

""China has already added enough new clean electricity generation to cover all new demand growth and power sector coal use and emissions have been falling since 2024 as a result. While the coal power decline is unlikely to be linear and may experience occasional setbacks, maintaining China's current pace of clean energy growth means a coal power peak is imminent,"" said Lauri Myllyvirta, Co-founder and Lead Analyst at CREA.

In Indonesia, the report said President Prabowo Subianto's 100 GW solar programme could ensure that coal power generation peaks by 2030.

""The real opportunity lies in translating this vision into a concrete delivery roadmap that positions clean energy to dominate new capacity additions,"" said Katherine Hasan, Analyst at CREA.

The report cautioned, however, that all three countries continue to expand coal-fired capacity which is a major risk to their clean energy transition.

India plans to add about 100 GW of new coal capacity by 2035, while China has 230 GW under construction.

""Unchecked coal power expansion risks creating powerful vested interests that could potentially delay the energy transition in China, India and Indonesia. Rapid reduction in power sector emissions post coal peak would not only require maintaining pre-2030 renewable energy growth rate in all three countries but also ensuring power market and grid reforms. The total reduction in power sector CO2 emissions could be equivalent to India's total 2019 CO2 emissions, compared to business-as-usual,"" Myllyvirta added.

The report said that the three countries are driven by similar motivations: improving energy security, reducing import dependence and attracting manufacturing investment.

But sustaining clean energy growth beyond 2030 will require strong policy support, modernised grids and political will to phase down coal use.

WÄRTSILÄ’S OUTLOOK

Marine

Wärtsilä expects the demand environment for the next 12 months (Q4/2025-Q3/2026) to be better than in the comparison period.

Energy

Wärtsilä expects the demand environment for the next 12 months (Q4/2025-Q3/2026) to be similar to that of the comparison period.

Energy Storage

Wärtsilä expects the demand environment for the next 12 months (Q4/2025-Q3/2026) to be better than in the comparison period. However, the current geopolitical uncertainty particularly impacts this business and may affect growth.

In general, Wärtsilä underlines that the current high external uncertainties make forward-looking statements challenging. Due to high geopolitical uncertainty, the changing landscape of global trade, and the lack of clarity related to tariffs, there are risks of postponements in investment decisions and of global economic activity slowing down.

HÅKAN AGNEVALL, PRESIDENT & CEO: GROWING ORDER INTAKE IN MARINE AND ENERGY, AND CONTINUED IMPROVED PROFITABILITY

“Wärtsilä’s third quarter of 2025 was characterised by steady activity in both the energy and marine markets. The external macroeconomic environment remained uncertain throughout the period. The OECD revised its 2025 global growth outlook upward, citing resilient emerging markets, front-loaded trade flows in response to anticipated US tariff changes, and strong investment in high technology sectors. However, it also notes that the full impact of higher tariffs remains unclear, with early signs of slowing output and consumption in advanced economies.

In the energy market, global electricity demand continues to rise, driven by accelerating electrification across sectors, growing industrial activity, and expanding data centre capacity. In parallel, the growing deployment of renewable energy is transforming power systems and increasing the need for flexible generation capacity. These market dynamics were evident in customer activity during the quarter. As an example, we secured an engineering and equipment contract to supply 12 Wärtsilä 50DF engines for a 217 MW power plant for East Kentucky Power Cooperative in the US. The plant is needed to provide additional grid capacity to meet growing demand.

In the marine market, sentiment has improved recently following a slow start to the year, supported by trade agreements between major economies, and the resilience in global trade. However, the impact on shipping demand has been uneven across segments, and growth in seaborne trade has moderated. Factors such as the ongoing uncertainty around trade policies, elevated newbuild prices, and softer demand in some segments have negatively affected new vessel orders this year. While new vessel ordering activity has slowed compared to the extraordinary levels seen in 2024, it remains above the 10-year average. Notably, activity in Wärtsilä’s key segments continued to be healthy. Also, the demand for alternative-fuel-capable vessels remained strong, representing 48 percent of contracted capacity so far in 2025.

After the reporting period, the vote to adopt the IMO’s Net Zero Framework was postponed by one year. This outcome opens the door to a fragmented landscape of carbon pricing mechanisms introduced by individual regions and countries. The EU already has its system in place, while China is signalling plans for its own programs, adding complexity to global shipping. At Wärtsilä, we offer a broad and flexible portfolio of technologies to support a wide range of decarbonisation strategies. We are helping our customers navigate the transition by optimising fuel efficiency and de-risking the future through fuel flexibility, leveraging hybrid solutions, alternative fuels, and carbon capture. Our commitment to sustainable innovation remains strong, aligned with evolving customer needs.

Order intake in the third quarter increased organically by 6%. Equipment order intake increased in Marine and Energy, while it decreased in Energy Storage. The Energy Storage business is facing headwinds from elevated US tariffs and regulatory changes particularly related to FEOC (Foreign Entity of Concern), as well as intensified competition in other markets. Service order intake remained stable, supported by several new long-term agreements and renewals, while retrofits and upgrades decreased. The rolling 12-month book-to-bill ratio in service remains well above 1, indicating future growth. Organic net sales remained stable. Service net sales increased, while equipment net sales decreased primarily due to the timing of deliveries in Energy.

The comparable operating result increased by 10% to EUR 195 million, representing 11.9% of net sales. The result was supported by increases in Marine and Energy Storage, while results in Energy and Portfolio Business decreased. In Energy, the comparable operating result was mainly impacted by lower equipment sales. In Portfolio Business, the comparable operating result decreased as the ANCS business unit is no longer reported under the segment following the successful closure of its divestment on 1 July 2025.

Cash flow from operating activities increased to EUR 340 million, following the improved result and a good level of received customer payments. The current working capital position is very favourable for our business, and we expect the negative level to be sustained over the next years. We will continue our active efforts to manage working capital to maintain it well below the long-term historical average.

We expect the demand environment for the coming 12 months to be better than in the comparison period in Marine and Energy Storage, while the demand environment in Energy is expected to remain at a similar level. However, as previously outlined, the current high external uncertainties make forward-looking statements challenging. It is worth noting that order intake in Energy has been strong over the past 12 months, whereas Energy Storage has experienced weaker development. The market dynamics in Energy Storage have changed significantly following the implementation of the April 2025 US tariff measures, which were introduced shortly after the completion of our strategic review and the launch of the new financial targets. The current situation is challenging, and we need orders for next year’s deliveries. While we remain focused on profitable customer segments, we are also looking at measures that improve the competitiveness of the Energy Storage business. We anticipate ordering to pick up in the fourth quarter. We also note that the positive development in Marine and Energy combined continues, with net sales growing organically by 13% and reaching a 13.2% operating margin during the last twelve months.

We are executing our strategy with discipline and purpose, supporting our customers to succeed in the fast-changing marine and energy sectors. We are building a resilient foundation for long-term success that enables us to innovate consistently, adapt swiftly, and remain a trusted partner in an increasingly complex global environment.”

According to IUMI’s latest research, global cargo premiums for 2024 reached US$22.64 billion, marking a 1.6 percent increase over the previous year.
Encouragingly, cargo loss ratios, the balance between premiums earned and claims paid, have improved consistently across most regions since 2018.

According to IUMI’s latest research, global cargo premiums for 2024 reached US$22.64 billion, marking a 1.6 percent increase over the previous year. This steady rise continues a multi-year upward trend.

Encouragingly, cargo loss ratios, the balance between premiums earned and claims paid, have improved consistently across most regions since 2018. The claims environment has also remained relatively benign, with no major catastrophic losses reported in 2024.

Brews commented: “The cargo market remains stable in terms of global premium income. We’ve seen a particularly large jump from China this year, though much of that is likely a correction of previously under-reported insurance on returns.

“That said, our sector continues to grapple with ongoing challenges, including cargo accumulations, mis-declared cargoes, the transition to net-zero and war-related risks. However, overall, 2024 brought no unexpected shocks.”

Looking ahead, however, Brews highlighted the growing impact of tariffs: “Tariffs are only just beginning to make their presence felt. In the coming months, we’ll be watching closely to see how they reshape insured cargo values and whether shippers and receivers shift to new markets and destinations to work around them. These changes could alter the entire cargo landscape.”

According to Brews, tariffs could increase insured values, and associated risk accumulations, by as much as 50 percent, particularly in North America. Other regions could also feel the effects, depending on where the transfer of risk occurs within global supply chains.

Shifting trade flows could disrupt established shipping patterns, forcing insurers to adapt to new routes, ports, and storage facilities, each bringing different risk profiles.

Brews also addressed market performance trends: “We’re definitely seeing an increase in market capacity. Some underwriters are now taking on larger risks at competitive premiums, which inevitably leads to some market softening. However, I don’t expect it to decline as sharply as some predict. Cargo underwriting remains profitable and that’s attracting fresh investment.”

Despite the current period of relative stability, Brews warned that tariffs and broader geopolitical tensions could still bring significant disruption: “If these forces reshape trade routes, costs, and volumes,” he concluded, “market stability and profitability will undoubtedly come under pressure.”

While the technology holds significant promise, DNV cautions that considerable regulatory, technological, and commercial challenges must still be overcome before it becomes a viable option for global shipping.
The shipping sector currently consumes around 350 million tonnes of fossil fuels each year and contributes roughly 3% of total global carbon emissions.
“Nuclear propulsion, once regarded as a distant prospect, is now under active consideration as a real option for the commercial maritime fleet,” said DNV Senior Principal Researcher Ole Christen Reistad in the foreword to the organisation’s new white paper.
DNV concludes that while nuclear propulsion could play a crucial role in achieving net-zero targets, the pathway forward requires extensive collaboration between regulators, shipbuilders, and technology developers to ensure safety, scalability, and public acceptance.","Growing environmental pressures are reigniting interest in nuclear propulsion as a long-term solution for maritime decarbonisation, according to Norwegian classification society DNV. While the technology holds significant promise, DNV cautions that considerable regulatory, technological, and commercial challenges must still be overcome before it becomes a viable option for global shipping.

The shipping sector currently consumes around 350 million tonnes of fossil fuels each year and contributes roughly 3% of total global carbon emissions. In July 2023, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) set ambitious greenhouse gas reduction targets, aiming for net-zero emissions by or around 2050.

“Nuclear propulsion, once regarded as a distant prospect, is now under active consideration as a real option for the commercial maritime fleet,” said DNV Senior Principal Researcher Ole Christen Reistad in the foreword to the organisation’s new white paper. “Shipyards and shipowners are exploring its potential and weighing the promise of virtually emission-free power against the complexity of introducing such a transformative technology into commercial fleets.”

DNV’s report, titled Maritime Nuclear Propulsion: Technologies, Commercial Viability, and Regulatory Challenges for Nuclear-Powered Vessels, outlines how marine nuclear systems differ from traditional land-based reactors.

It stresses the importance of developing a comprehensive understanding of fuel management, waste handling, vessel design, and the oversight of nuclear supply chains.

The paper also reviews advanced reactor types most likely to attract shipowner interest, assessing their feasibility within maritime operations. DNV concludes that while nuclear propulsion could play a crucial role in achieving net-zero targets, the pathway forward requires extensive collaboration between regulators, shipbuilders, and technology developers to ensure safety, scalability, and public acceptance.

In a recent Maritime Impact article, classification society DNV highlighted infrastructure trends and transition models that can support wider adoption of low-GHG bunker fuels across the maritime sector based on its latest Maritime Forecast to 2050:

The maritime industry faces a pivotal moment as it adapts to regulation, including the new IMO Net-Zero Framework (pending adoption), aimed at reducing ship greenhouse gas emissions. DNV’s latest Maritime Forecast to 2050 offers practical insights and analysis to help stakeholders make informed decisions on ships, fuels, technologies and infrastructure for a net-zero future.

“For shipowners exploring low-GHG fuels and onboard carbon capture, knowing when and where they can refuel and offload captured CO₂ is crucial,” explains Eirik Ovrum, Maritime Principal Consultant at DNV and lead author of the paper. In this article, we highlight the latest developments and emphasize the importance of Chain of Custody models to verify the origin and sustainability of alternative fuels.

Net-Zero Framework sets new course for shipping

Shipping’s energy transition is being shaped by IMO’s revised 2023 GHG Strategy: a 20 per cent emissions reduction from shipping by 2030, a 70 per cent reduction (at least) by 2040, and full-scale decarbonization “by or around” 2050 – all compared with 2008 levels.

The Net-Zero Framework (NZF) aims to accelerate the adoption of low-GHG fuels and technologies. Maritime Forecast to 2050 describes the NZF and compares its consequences with those of relevant EU regulations.

A forthcoming DNV white paper will examine the NZF in depth following the October 2025 IMO meeting, where its adoption is expected to be voted on.

The NZF is based on a GHG fuel intensity (GFI) metric expressed in amount of carbon dioxide (CO2), or its equivalent, per unit of energy used on board in a calendar year on a well-to-wake basis.

Starting in 2028, progressively stricter GFI targets are anticipated to be introduced annually. If adopted, the NZF will affect technology choices and the operation of ships as well as the development of shoreside infrastructure and the availability of low-GHG fuels and CO2 storage.

Tracking the fuel and technology transition

Drawing on data from DNV’s Alternative Fuels Insight platform and S&P Global, Maritime Forecast to 2050 reveals a clear shift: LNG and methanol are gaining traction, while ammonia, hydrogen and on-board carbon capture are entering early trials.

Her speech underscored Norway’s commitment to fostering international collaboration and advancing a greener, more resilient ocean economy that benefits both industry and society.

Minister Næss began by commending the scale and vision of India Maritime Week and expressed her appreciation for the active participation of the global maritime community. She particularly acknowledged the growing strength of the Malaysian maritime sector, describing it as a complete industry cluster comprising shipbuilders, shipowners, suppliers, and a dedicated financial network.

She emphasized that such a well-integrated ecosystem is fully equipped to address both the challenges and opportunities arising from the sector’s transition toward sustainability. Næss noted that the maritime industry is undergoing a defining transformation—one that requires innovation, resilience, and shared global action.

The Minister addressed a common misconception that emission-reduction policies increase costs and disadvantage consumers. She argued that this short-term view fails to account for the far greater long-term costs of climate inaction.

“Climate change already affects us all, and it affects the most vulnerable the most,” she stated, stressing that environmental sustainability and economic growth must evolve together. The goal, she said, is not to view decarbonisation as a burden, but as an investment in a stable, inclusive, and future-ready maritime economy.

Reflecting on Norway’s own maritime journey, Næss explained that the country’s progress in decarbonising shipping did not occur overnight. It was the result of decades of consistent policy support and public–private collaboration. Despite being a high-cost economy, Norway has maintained robust regulations and incentives to encourage innovation, foster competitiveness, and advance sustainability across the maritime value chain.

Successive Norwegian governments, she said, have understood that the maritime sector is central to national growth and identity. Maintaining consistent policies over time has enabled the industry to innovate, modernize, and lead in the adoption of green technologies—demonstrating that environmental responsibility can coexist with economic strength.

Government–Industry partnership for the green transition

A key focus of Næss’s address was Norway’s model of close cooperation between government and industry. She emphasized that the green transition can only succeed when all stakeholders—policy makers, companies, and innovators—work together toward shared goals.

In 2024, Norway signed a maritime partnership agreement with leading organisations in the shipping and fisheries sectors. The initiative aims to enhance knowledge-sharing, strengthen cooperation on green transition strategies, and assess the effectiveness of ongoing policies. Næss explained that Norway’s approach combines domestic initiatives with strong international engagement, ensuring that progress at home contributes to global maritime sustainability.

Ambitious emission targets and global leadership

Norway has set a clear and measurable ambition: to reduce emissions from domestic shipping and fisheries by 50% by 2030, compared to 2005 levels. The country is also advocating for stricter international regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from shipping, helping to expand the global market for low- and zero-emission solutions.

Næss reaffirmed Norway’s strong support for the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) Net Zero Framework, calling on all member states to accelerate their commitments within the next year. “This is a decisive decade,” she noted, urging global leaders to align ambition with action.

Highlighting the shared challenges faced by ocean nations such as India and Norway, the Minister called for greater unity on issues like maritime security, fair trade, sustainability, and ocean preservation. She stressed that decarbonisation must go hand in hand with social sustainability—a principle known as a just transition.

“A just transition ensures that climate policies foster shared progress rather than deepen inequalities,” she explained, adding that global fairness must remain at the heart of climate action. Shipping, being a global industry, requires collective responsibility to ensure that all countries can participate equitably in the green transformation.

India’s growing role in global shipping

Minister Næss praised India’s leadership in the global maritime landscape, citing its technological capability, digital innovation, manufacturing strength, and expertise in ship recycling. She expressed optimism over India’s increasing alignment with global environmental and climate goals, describing it as a sign of maturity and readiness to help shape the future of sustainable shipping.

Concluding her keynote, Næss reminded delegates that economic opportunity and environmental responsibility must coexist for the maritime sector to thrive. “A healthy blue economy depends on healthy oceans,” she said. “Oceans know no borders—and neither should our cooperation.”

She reaffirmed Norway’s long-standing maritime partnership with India and called for continued collaboration beyond the conference to ensure a cleaner, greener, and more equitable future for global shipping.",https://etedge-insights.com/wp-content/uploads/default-article-banner.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 11:17:14.670234

“There is now certainty that this regulation’s entry into effect will be delayed by 12 months to 1st January 2029, but there is also increased uncertainty that it will be adopted at all,” commented a release from University College London (UCL).

Dr Tristan Smith, professor of energy and transport at UCL Shipping and Oceans Research Group, said: “Instead of clarification, shipping and the global trade and energy systems now face significantly increased uncertainty and therefore risk. Understanding what happened at the IMO in October and why is now central not just for any chance of future adoption, but for just and equitable climate action generally. This lost momentum can be recovered, but we have taken a step closer to the abyss that is dangerous climate change.”

One potential upshot from this month’s indecision, according to analysts at Jefferies, an investment bank, could be a shift back to conventional fuel engines for new vessel orders and for many of those currently in the orderbook.

“We expect many to shift their dual-fuel ‘capable’ newbuildings to dual-fuel ‘ready’ to lower capex, especially for 2027 and onward deliveries (when engine changes can still be made).

A Bold Investment

That leadership intent is evident in the Modi government’s recent approval of a Rs 69,725 crore ($8 billion) package to reimagine, revive, and rejuvenate India’s shipbuilding and maritime ecosystem. This is not a routine budget line, but a signal of ambition. By investing at scale, the Modi government has sent a message that India will play a meaningful role in the global shift to low-carbon shipping. It will be a pace-setter.

This historic decision sets the stage for a maritime renaissance — a return to the spirit of seafaring enterprise that once defined Bharat’s trading heritage. It also aligns seamlessly with PM Narendra Modi’s vision of Viksit Bharat by 2047 — a confident, capable nation that anchors global trade routes, not merely services them.

The Global Tide Is Turning

The International Maritime Organisation (IMO) has set a clear course toward net-zero emissions by 2050. Europe has already moved from words to enforcement — its carbon market now charges ships for emissions, and the FuelEU Maritime regulations tighten fuel standards each year.

The direction is unmistakable: Alternative fuels such as green ammonia and methanol are shifting from pilot projects to purchase orders. This is the moment when policy leaves its footprint on the market, which, in turn, creates momentum. India’s advantages — low renewable energy costs, engineering expertise, and skilled seafarers — can convert that momentum into a meaningful market share.

India’s renewable power tariffs, discovered by the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI), are among the lowest globally — around Rs 2 per kilowatt hour. That translates into competitively priced green fuels. Recent bids for green ammonia have settled near Rs 52 per kg, placing Indian production costs below $650 per tonne — cheaper than many established export hubs.

This price advantage is not theoretical. Asian shipping lines and European buyers are already negotiating long-term contracts in the $550–$1,000 per tonne range. India is ready to deliver at scale.

Equally critical is our industrial ecosystem. Our country’s heavy-engineering backbone that served the oil and petrochemical sectors is now repurposing themselves for the green transition — fabricating bunkering skids, dual-fuel engines, and storage systems for clean fuels. Our geography amplifies these strengths: Ports on both coasts sit astride major global trade lanes, and our seafarers can be rapidly up-skilled to handle cryogenic and digital systems for new fuels. India can produce, handle, and export the next generation of marine fuels faster and more affordably than most.

From Vision to Bankable Demand

However, ambition alone doesn’t unlock capital — bankable projects do. That is why translating intent into investable demand is the next frontier.

A joint study by the Indian Ports Association (IPA) and RMI, Gateway to Green, identifies Deendayal, VO Chidambaranar (VOC), and Paradip ports as early candidates for green-fuel hubs. They already have the land, draft, and pipeline potential. With targeted investments in storage, grid upgrades, and multi-fuel terminals, these ports can become“green ready.”

The next step is to ensure demand. Domestic green shipping corridors — such as Kandla to VOC — and international routes linking India with Singapore and Rotterdam can aggregate fuel needs and create predictable throughput. When supply meets structured demand, finance follows. Shipowners can plan fleet conversions, cargo owners can lock in long-term charters, and lenders can assess risk with confidence. This is how India intends to position itself as an indispensable node in the global low-carbon maritime economy.

Building Confidence, Creating Value

Our ministry’s immediate priority is credibility. Early milestones — pilot corridors, port retrofits, and operational benchmarks — will prove that green shipping is not an experiment but an economic upgrade. Visible success will build investor confidence, inform future regulation, and serve as a template for replication across lighthouse ports.

The macroeconomic case is equally strong. Aligning with emerging IMO and EU standards preserves export market access and shields Indian industries from future carbon penalties. Domestic manufacturing of engines, storage tanks, and digital systems will generate skilled employment and retain value onshore. A full-fledged green maritime ecosystem will create recurring service revenue for ports, while cutting freight emissions — a strategic advantage in a carbon-constrained global economy.

Every global transition presents a narrow window where leadership is won or lost. As carbon prices rise and compliance rules tighten, vessels will choose ports that offer clean fuels and efficient services. Those who act early will shape the new trade geography. Those who delay will pay higher costs to catch up.

India’s $8-billion commitment is more than an investment — it is a declaration. It signals that we intend not just to adapt to a changing world but to shape it. In doing so, we move decisively toward realising the vision of PM Narendra Modi’s Viksit Bharat by 2047 — ready not merely to participate in the green maritime economy but to lead it through initiatives taken in Amrit Kaal.

The world was on the brink of a climate milestone: adopting a global carbon tax for the shipping industry. Countries had spent years crafting the plan, hoping to throttle planet-warming pollution from cargo vessels. They had every reason to think the measure would pass when the International Maritime Organization (IMO) met in mid-October.

Enter Donald Trump. After returning to the White House for a second term, the president and his top officials undertook a monthslong campaign to defeat the initiative. The US threatened tariffs, levies and visa restrictions to get its way. A battery of American diplomats and cabinet secretaries met with various nations to twist arms, according to a senior US State Department official, who asked for anonymity to speak candidly. Nations were also warned of other potential consequences if they backed the tax on shipping emissions, including imposing sanctions on individuals and blocking ships from US ports.

Under that Trump-led pressure—or intimidation, as some describe it—some countries started to waver. Ultimately, a bloc including the US, Saudi Arabia and Iran voted to adjourn the meeting for a year, killing any chance of the charge being adopted anytime soon.

The US “bullied otherwise supportive or neutral countries into turning against” the net-zero plan for shipping, says Faïg Abbasov, a director at the European advocacy group Transport & Environment. With its intense lobbying at the IMO, the Trump administration was “waging war against multilateralism, UN diplomacy and climate diplomacy.”

At first glance, it might look like the US has exited the climate fight. The president is once again pulling the US out of the Paris Agreement, and he may not send an official US delegation to next month’s COP30 climate summit in Brazil. But don’t be confused: America is still in the arena; it’s just fighting for the other side.

Since his return to Washington, Trump has used trade talks, tariff threats and verbal dressing-downs to encourage countries to jettison their renewable energy commitments (and buy more US oil and liquefied natural gas in the process). Just 10 months into his second term, the campaign is showing surprising success as key figures and countries increasingly buckle under the determined pressure.

Trump was elected to implement a “common sense energy agenda,” says White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers. He “will not jeopardize our country’s economic and national security to pursue vague climate goals that are killing other countries.”

Oil and gas supporters champion the president’s ambition. They say he’s helped reset the global conversation around climate change and given a welcome political opening to banks, corporations and other governments that wanted to back away from some sustainability targets in the face of growing electricity demand. “President Trump is sort of providing the banks, the European Union and others cover for tempering their climate ambitions,” says Tom Pyle, president of the American Energy Alliance, an advocacy group. “He gives these countries the ability to say, ‘Hey, I’m just trying to go along with the United States here. That’s why I’m buying all this LNG.’”

But in the eyes of environmental advocates and leaders who depend on multilateralism as a means for global climate action, Trump is unfairly asserting his will on a world that’s running out of time to rein in emissions and avert the worst consequences of global warming. “They’re clearly casting a much wider net to the climate destruction than they did the first time,” says Jake Schmidt, a senior strategic director for the Natural Resources Defense Council. “They have more people engaged in it, and they obviously had more time to plan for it.”

The strong-arming is happening on multiple fronts. Among the biggest is trade, where Trump has already compelled Japan, South Korea and the EU to pledge to spend on American energy and energy infrastructure. Japan, for instance, agreed to invest $550 billion on US projects, and talks are underway to steer some of that funding to a $44 billion Alaska gas pipeline and export site. South Korea has pledged roughly $100 billion in US energy purchases.

The EU, meanwhile, has vowed to spend some $750 billion buying American energy, including LNG, to secure lower tariffs on its exports to the US. Analysts have questioned whether those sales will fully materialize, since they’d require Europe to more than triple its annual energy imports from the US. But the public commitment by itself was a stunning move for a bloc that’s led the world in pushing policies to combat climate change—including by setting binding targets for slashing planet-warming pollution, establishing a “green deal” plan to shed fossil fuels and slapping a tariff on carbon-intensive imports.

Trump administration officials have seized on the US-EU trade deal to urge other changes. For instance, Energy Secretary Chris Wright is pressuring the bloc to relax curbs on the methane footprint of imported gas. The EU is already easing corporate sustainability requirements so fewer companies are compelled to limit their environmental harms, a retrenchment that came after pressure from Germany and other European stakeholders as well as the White House.

Meanwhile the US administration has been goading the International Energy Agency to shuffle its leadership and urged the IEA to reinstate forecasts that show a rosier outlook for fossil fuel demand. It has pressed multilateral development banks to prioritize fossil fuels over climate adaptation and clean energy projects when their financing of those green initiatives has become critical given widespread foreign aid cuts. And Trump himself has berated countries that aren’t falling in line. In a September speech to the United Nations General Assembly, he chided nations for setting policies around what he called the “hoax” and “con job” of climate change, warning that they can’t be “great again” without “traditional energy sources.” He’s also told UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer to reject wind turbines and embrace the North Sea’s oil riches.

It’s a marked acceleration from term-one Trump. During his first four years in the White House, Trump’s “energy dominance” agenda amounted to rally cries of “drill, baby, drill” and slow steps to encourage more domestic oil and gas production. This time around, the president’s approach has global reach—and far fewer limits. And when it comes to international agreements relating to energy and climate, “the US has an interest in divide and rule, and thus breaking the potential for cooperation,” says Abby Innes, an associate professor in political economy at the London School of Economics.

Whether or not US officials attend COP30 in November, the US president’s influence will loom large. “Countries like Saudi Arabia feel emboldened by Trump to promote fossil fuels,” says Linda Kalcher, founder of the Strategic Perspectives think tank and a veteran of the annual UN climate summits. One European diplomat said the main goal now at COP30 is just to avoid being bullied.

To be sure, other countries haven’t followed the US exodus from the Paris Agreement, and the deployment of clean energy is still soaring globally. Even tax incentive phaseouts and project cancellations in the US are only slowing, not stopping, the country’s adoption of wind and solar power. And while multinational companies may be dialing down their green rhetoric, analysts say many are still quietly cleaning up their supply chains and operations to keep selling in California, Europe and other places demanding more sustainability.

And in a perverse twist for a US president who’s decried the world’s reliance on China, other nations are increasingly linking arms with Beijing as they bid for zero-emission energy tech. “When it comes to dealing with China, whether it’s countries or companies, politicians and executives tell me: ‘Better the devil that you know,’” says Ioannis Ioannou, an associate professor at the London Business School whose research focuses on sustainability and corporate social responsibility. “It offers more stability than the Trump administration.” —With Jack Wittels and John Ainger

The highlight of the session was the address by Mohan Charan Majhi, Chief Minister of Odisha, who graced the occasion as the Chief Guest.

Odisha Chief Minister during his speech at as chief guest at Odisha sate session at India Maritime Week 2025, outlined an ambitious vision for transforming the state into India’s Eastern Maritime Gateway.

Welcoming dignitaries including Manoj Ahuja (CEO), Trihaman Sharma (Deputy CEO), Usha Padhee (CEO, Banjara Parival Committee), P.L. Haranath (Chairman, Bharatiya Port Authority), and several leading industry figures, the Chief Minister extended his greetings and reaffirmed the government’s commitment to unlocking Odisha’s full maritime and industrial potential.

Highlighting the state’s rapid transformation, he recalled the “Make in Odisha Conclave 2025” as a milestone in the state’s industrial resurgence, signalling a shift from the export of raw materials to high-value, diversified trade.

The Chief Minister emphasized Odisha’s Vision Document 2036–2047, which targets the creation of a $500 billion economy by 2036 and a $1.5 trillion economy by 2047. “Under the guidance of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Odisha’s maritime infrastructure is being modernized at an unprecedented pace,” he said, adding that the state’s 575 km-long coastline positions it as a natural hub for India’s eastern maritime ambitions.

At the event’s central session on ‘Port-led Development Vision 2047’, he announced plans to increase Odisha’s current port capacity from 80 million tonnes to 500 million tonnes by 2070. The state’s multi-port network will include green hydrogen hubs, deep-sea ports at Avatar and Subala, a captive jetty at Jatada Mohan, and a satellite port at Bahuda with a capacity of 150 million tonnes.

A Coastal Economic Zone and a Shipbuilding Hub at Jandrapur, with an investment of ₹25,000 crore, are also under development, forming part of an $8 billion maritime infrastructure plan.

Sustainability was identified as a key pillar of growth. The Chief Minister noted that Odisha is spearheading India’s transition toward a zero-emission economy, led by projects such as the Gopalpur Green Ammonia Project—the largest of its kind in the country. Aligning with the International Maritime Organization’s 2050 net-zero goal, Odisha aims to play a defining role in global green shipping and energy ecosystems.

To strengthen institutional frameworks, the state has established the Odisha Maritime Board and rolled out the Odisha Port Policy 2025, which introduces innovative initiatives such as Maritime Spatial Planning and Boat Modernization Programs—the first of their kind in India.

He also highlighted tourism and cultural development initiatives, noting that Puri has been elevated to a Municipal Corporation and developed as a global heritage destination, while Chilika Lake is emerging as a major eco-tourism hub with growing investments in cruise tourism and water sports.

Recalling Odisha’s maritime legacy symbolized by the Bali Jatra festival in Cuttack, the Chief Minister said, “Our maritime heritage is not just history—it is a living inspiration for our future. Through modernization and innovation, we are transforming that heritage into a powerful growth engine.”

Concluding his address, he invited investors and industry leaders to partner with the state in building a prosperous, sustainable, and globally connected Odisha, reaffirming the vision of an inclusive blue economy that integrates industrial growth, renewable energy, aquaculture, and coastal tourism.

The vote of thanks was delivered by Bidhan Chandra Ray, OAS, Additional Secretary, Commerce & Transport Department, Government of Odisha, who expressed gratitude to all dignitaries, speakers, and participants for their valuable insights and collaboration.

The session featured initial remarks from Bibhuti Bhushan Jena and Hemant Sharma, IAS, Additional Chief Secretary, Industries and I&PR Department, Government of Odisha. The discussion was moderated by Usha Padhee, IAS, who also serves as Principal Secretary for Housing & Urban Development Department.

A distinguished panel of experts enriched the session with in-depth perspectives on the state’s maritime prospects. The panel comprised:

P. L. Haranadh, IRTS, Chairman, Paradip Port Authority, Government of India

Santosh Kumar Mohapatra, IAS (Retd.), Former Chairman, Paradip Port Authority and Dhamra & Vizhinjam Ports

Subrat Tripathy, President, Business Development, Adani Ports and SEZ (APSEZ)

Rinkesh Roy, Joint Managing Director and CEO, JSW Infrastructure

Captain Ashok Mahapatra, Director (Retd.), Maritime Safety Division, International Maritime Organization (IMO)

Devendra Thakar, CEO, Dhamra Port Company Ltd.

The session underscored Odisha’s commitment to advancing port-led growth, green energy adoption, and sustainable coastal development. With its robust maritime infrastructure, policy support, and investor-friendly initiatives, Odisha is emerging as a pivotal player in India’s maritime future.

Opening the discussion, Santosh Mahapatra underscored the strategic importance of Odisha’s coastline, noting that while India has 28 states, only nine are coastal — making Odisha’s maritime development a matter of national relevance.

He compared Odisha’s coastal potential to Gujarat’s, highlighting its proximity to the northern and eastern hinterland, but cautioned that the state’s open coastline demands heavier infrastructure investment, including long channels, breakwaters, and extensive rail connectivity.

Mahapatra emphasized that minimum port viability in Odisha begins at 20–25 million tonnes, due to high fixed costs, and urged against “overambitious or technically unsound” projects.

He projected that, to meet India’s growth aspirations, Odisha’s port capacity must expand from 202 million tonnes to over 1,000 million tonnes by 2047, and recommended maintaining surplus capacity to prevent congestion.

Calling ports “generational investments,” he advocated for environmentally responsible development, greater use of inland waterways and pipelines, and flexible PPP frameworks. Mahapatra also suggested southern Odisha as an ideal location for deep-sea and petrochemical industries.

Sandeep Tripathi highlighted that “Odisha’s moment has arrived,” driven by its 575 km coastline, strong industrial base, and growing fiscal strength. He emphasized that Odisha and its neighboring states together form India’s industrial heartland, rich in coal, steel, and minerals — creating a natural cargo advantage for port expansion.

He called for integrated connectivity, proposing multi-utility economic corridors linking mineral belts with ports through a mix of road, rail, and pipelines, similar to the Delhi–Mumbai Industrial Corridor. Tripathi suggested developing Port-Led Industrial Ecosystems every 150 km, with sector-specific clusters — petrochemicals at Paradip, coal at Astaranga, and green ammonia and hydrogen industries at Gopalpur and Bahuda.

Outlining a blue economy framework, he urged a balance of economic growth, environmental stewardship, and social prosperity. Tripathi stressed the need to expand maritime education and training, aiming to increase Indian seafarers’ global share from 12% to 45%.

He concluded by positioning Odisha as the next major logistics and export hub, complementing Gujarat on the western coast.

Veteran maritime expert Capt. Ashok Mahapatra described shipping as the “gearbox of the global economy”, emphasizing that without it, “half the world would starve and the other half would freeze.”

He urged renewed focus on shipbuilding and repair facilities in Odisha, calling them potential game-changers for industrial growth and employment. Such investments, he noted, would stimulate ancillary industries and MSMEs, creating large-scale job opportunities.

In 2022, over 55 percent of the construction industry’s carbon emissions stemmed from cementitious materials, bricks, and metals, while glass, plastics, chemicals, and bio-based materials contributed six percent, and the remaining 37 percent arose from transport, services, machinery, and on-site activities.

Lead author Chaohui Li from Peking University summarizes: “The study shows that the construction sector now drives one-third of global CO₂ emissions, up from around 20 percent in 1995. If current trends continue, the sector can exceed the 2°C per annum carbon budget earliest by 2040.”

Projections are alarming

Based on past data, different future emission scenarios were projected. Under the business-as-usual scenario, the construction carbon footprint alone will exceed the per-annum carbon budget for the 1.5°C and 2°C goals in the next two decades, not considering other industries.

“Between 2023 and 2050, cumulative construction-related emissions are expected to reach 440 gigatons of CO₂. This is enough to consume the entire remaining global carbon budget for 1.5°C,” explains coauthor Prajal Pradhan, a professor at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands.

The study shows a significant shift in emissions from developed to developing regions. In 1995, high-income countries produced half of construction emissions. By 2022, emissions in these economies had largely stabilized, while growth in developing regions was increasingly driven by reliance on carbon-intensive materials such as steel and cement.

At the same time, the use of bio-based materials such as timber has declined, underscoring a missed opportunity for low-carbon alternatives.

Call for a material revolution

The authors call for a global “material revolution” – a fundamental shift away from carbon-intensive building materials toward low-carbon, circular, and bio-based alternatives such as engineered timber, bamboo, and recycled composites. Their analysis shows that cementitious materials, bricks, and metals alone now account for more than half of the sector’s emissions, emphasizing the urgent need to reinvent how the world builds.

“The challenges and solutions for decarbonizing construction are not globally uniform. Tipping full supply-chain-scale changes ultimately requires structural shifts material-wise, reducing reliance on traditional materials like cement, steel, and bricks, while exploring new alternatives,” explains coauthor Jürgen Kropp from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK).

The authors further argue that high-income regions should lead through innovation, circular design, and stricter regulation, while developing regions – where most new construction will occur – need targeted financial and technological support to leapfrog directly to sustainable building practices.

Without such a material transformation, the study warns, the construction sector alone could consume the entire remaining carbon budget for the 1.5°C goal in the next two decades. A coordinated global effort to scale up low-carbon materials and redesign construction systems is therefore essential to keep climate commitments within reach.

Global challenge

As the world continues to urbanize rapidly, reducing the construction sector’s environmental impact will be key to achieving sustainable and climate-resilient cities. The study provides the most comprehensive global analysis of construction emissions to date, tracking 49 countries and regions and 163 sectors between 1995 and 2022.

“Humanity has literally built itself into a corner with steel and cement,” says IIASA’s director general Hans Joachim (John) Schellnhuber.

“To meet the Paris goals, we must reinvent the very materials that shape our cities. A global material revolution rooted in circularity, innovation, and cooperation can turn the construction sector from a climate problem into a cornerstone of a sustainable and resilient future.”

The decision by the International Maritime Organization to delay the Net-Zero Framework by a year has exposed deep divisions. What should have been a coordinated global effort toward decarbonisation has resulted in paralysis at the very moment the industry needs clarity and unity.

The truth is that shipping’s path to net zero has been hampered by over-promised targets for an under-delivered infrastructure. The promise of a smooth, rapid transition simply doesn’t match what is actually happening. We are years away from having the global supply chains, bunkering networks, and safety systems required to support alternative fuels at scale. Yet the rhetoric continues as if the transformation is already underway.

Shipowners are responding with pragmatism. The order book for new vessels has slowed, particularly for ships designed for future fuels. Many owners are delaying investment decisions, opting instead to extend the life of existing fleets until the picture becomes clearer. That is not reluctance; it is realism. As one owner put it recently, “Why commit billions to technology that might change next year?”

Even classification societies are now urging caution. The CEO of ABS recently warned that the industry must make its energy transition “solid and bulletproof” before charging ahead. It’s a message the market understands. Investing in untested technologies or volatile fuel pathways without clear regulation or proven performance risks both capital and compliance.

The debate around LNG shows how complex these choices have become. Once positioned as a transitory fuel, LNG is now under scrutiny for methane leakage and questionable lifecycle emissions. Critics argue it should not even be considered a clean fuel at all, despite its endorsement by the IMO. Yet, LNG is far from disappearing. In reality, it will likely remain part of the energy mix for the next 30 or 40 years, simply because the infrastructure exists and the alternatives are not yet viable.

The same is true for heavy fuel oil and diesel. These fuels still dominate global shipping because they are reliable, available, and supported by decades of engineering expertise. Even with retrofits and efficiency measures, the majority of the world’s fleet will continue to rely on conventional fuels for decades to come.

Meanwhile, China has positioned itself as the frontrunner in methanol and ammonia fuel provision. It has built the production capacity, the engines, and the shipyards capable of delivering methanol-powered tonnage at scale. The IMO’s growing acceptance of methanol plays directly into that agenda. But outside Asia, most markets are nowhere near ready to follow.

What we’re witnessing isn’t failure, it’s the industry finding its balance. Net zero by 2050 remains an important goal, but the path to achieving it will be slower, costlier, and far more complex than the policymakers suggest. The industry needs time to understand which technologies work, how fuels will be supplied globally, and what regulations will actually stick.

At EmissionLink, we see this as a moment to think strategically and provide ship owners with clear, data-driven decarbonisation plans that balance compliance, cost, and practicality. That means understanding evolving regulations, selecting the right retrofit technologies, and mapping out fuel strategies that can adapt over time.

The next few years will not be about speed, but about smart preparation and navigating complexity. The companies that succeed will be those that take a measured approach, by analysing the market, investing in efficiency, and waiting for the right moment to act.

The reality is that the energy transition will take longer and cost more than most forecasts predict. But realism, not rhetoric, will move us forward. Between ambition and action lies a vast sea of uncertainty, and it is in navigating that space that the maritime industry will ultimately find its course.",https://splash247.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Cosco-Green-Methanol-bunkering.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 16:20:27.818241

Monday, October 27, 2025

The usually low-profile IMO (International Maritime Organization) was scheduled to make an unusually high-profile decision on October 17th. The question at hand was whether or not to adopt a “greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions pricing mechanism” for shipping under their Net-Zero Framework (NZF).

However, on that same date, the member nations voted “to postpone for one year the adoption,” with 57 for, 49 against, and 29 abstaining. The U.S., Singapore, and Saudi Arabia led the way for a delay. Supposedly, “many developing countries” described this as “undiplomatic” “bullying.”

When it comes to so-called ‘climate action,’ the UN has a strong track record of not giving up. The IMO will probably wait and see which way the political winds blow over the next twelve months before once again pursuing their carbon tax on international shipping.

IMO asserts that the NZF pricing mechanism “has been widely mischaracterized as a global carbon tax.” The Trump administration is thankfully not buying what the IMO is selling, nor are many conservative media commentators and think tanks, whether Trump-friendly or not.

In a joint statement on October 10th by U.S. Secretaries Rubio, Wright, and Duffy: “The Administration unequivocally rejects … the UN’s First Global Carbon Tax … an unsanctioned global tax regime.”

All that is bad enough, but IMO is also at odds with President Trump’s 47 executive orders on Unleashing American Energy, Restoring Gold Standard Science, and Restoring America’s Maritime Dominance.

High-profile economist Stephen Moore penned, “The resolution is intended to advance the very ‘net zero’ carbon emissions standard…American voters have rejected.” And, “Since when are American businesses subject to international taxes imposed by the UN?”

The Wall Street Journal editorial board opined: “This is the first instance…of the UN claiming the ability to levy a tax — the revenues from which will be paid directly into a UN-controlled fund. For the UN system, as a whole, roughly 90% of revenue comes from governments.”

A report by Shuting Pomerleau of the American Action Forum outlined much of the details, like: “a two-tiered tax rate mechanism … two-tiered fuel standard divides vessels into three levels of tax liability … three ways in which shipping companies can pay[.]”

American Enterprise Institute’s Brett Schaefer also pointed out: “Over 90% of the current global fleet uses conventional fuels and cannot utilize greener alternatives. Consequently, fuel costs are projected to rise by 350% … and consumers will bear the brunt of the price.”

IMO’s scheme fits the Tax Foundation’s definition of tax, “a mandatory payment or charge collected by … governments from … businesses to cover the costs of general government … activities,” and carbon tax, “a price on [GHG] emissions to encourage … businesses … to produce less of them.”

And the IMO has not just ‘gone green’ and ‘climate alarmist’ in recent years. They have been moving in the latter direction for years, and in the former direction for decades.

IMO was established between 1948 and 1958 with “a focus on safety,” which it was until 1967. Their focus then shifted to “protecting the marine environment” from 1973 to 1978, and then since 2011 to 2015 to “tackling the climate crisis.”

In 2011, “the first set of international mandatory measures to improve ships’ energy efficiency were adopted” by the IMO, followed by their commitment in 2015 “to take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts … to cut GHG emissions which cause global warming.”

IMO explicitly started to equate, or conflate, “energy efficiency” with “cut GHG emissions” in the “Initial IMO GHG Strategy” of 2018. It “envisages … a [total annual] reduction … at least 50% by 2050 compared to 2008 [as well as] pursuing efforts towards phasing them out entirely.”

The “Revised IMO GHG Strategy” of 2023 “includes indicative check-points for international shipping to reach net-zero GHG emissions for 2030 (by at least 20%, striving for 30%) and 2040 (by at least 70%, striving for 80%) compared to 2008.”

The 2023 strategy “emphasizes capacity building, technical cooperation, and research and development.” But the 2025 framework “refers to a new set of international regulations aimed at reducing GHG emissions from ships [of a] global fuel standard [and] pricing mechanism.”

A “comprehensive impact assessment” (CIA) was also considered in 2024. However, this did not include any risk analysis (RA) nor any cost-benefit assessment (CBA), unlike what is required, for example, in a Formal Safety Assessment (FSA) for use in the IMO rule-making process.

Sound CBA, that includes proper RA, is the ‘gold standard’ in economics to properly judge any proposed new tax or regulation. This is best done by using a ‘red teaming’ approach in order to try to counter the ‘bootleggers and Baptists’ within the IMO and without.

The 2024 CIA did include some elasticity analysis, but “one primary gap arises from the need for robust historical or empirical evidence within the shipping domain … the varied elasticities observed across different countries, commodities, types of vessels, and travel distances.”

As even a pro-carbon tax researcher reminds, “the reaction of producers [like international shippers] and consumers to changing prices depends on price elasticities of supply and demand … furthermore determines the incidence of carbon taxes on [them].”

IMO has been ‘captured’ by energy ‘bootleggers’ and climate ‘Baptists’ and is now part of the globalist ‘deep state.’ They have slightly delayed, but will not abandon, their grandiose climate vision for 2050.

Thus, the one-year pause on a global shipping carbon tax, to quote Rick and Morty, “just sounds like slavery with extra steps.” Therefore, one way or another, “hey ho, IMO has gotta go!”

Progress Amidst Setbacks

Last week, the IMO’s decision to delay the adoption of the Net Zero Framework was met with disappointment. However, Delaine McCullough, president of the Clean Shipping Coalition, emphasized that this delay is not a defeat but rather a temporary setback. “During this week’s ISWG meeting, IMO member states have constructively engaged in preparing the guidelines that will be necessary once the NZF is adopted,” she stated. This indicates a strong commitment to the framework and a willingness to continue preparations for its eventual implementation.

The Net Zero Framework aims to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions from ships, aligning with the IMO’s broader GHG Strategy. Key components of the NZF include a global fuel standard (GFS) that mandates a gradual reduction in the pollution levels of ship fuels. This standard will also introduce a pricing mechanism for GHG emissions, incentivizing the shipping industry to adopt cleaner practices. John Maggs, the Clean Shipping Coalition’s representative at the IMO, highlighted that member states do not need to wait for the NZF to take action. He pointed out that at the upcoming MEPC 84 meeting in April 2026, there will be opportunities to enhance the Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII), a crucial measure for improving energy efficiency in shipping.

Future Directions and Innovations

Despite the postponement of the NZF, discussions at the ISWG meeting advanced on essential implementation guidelines. Dr. Alison Shaw, IMO Manager at Transport & Environment, noted that the framework’s success will depend on coherent guidance that promotes sustainable fuel production while preventing environmental harm. Many member states recognized the need for a balanced approach that considers both environmental impacts and social equity, as highlighted by Andrew Dumbrille, Co-Founder and Director of Equal Routes. He stressed the importance of creating a fair pathway for the shipping sector to achieve its net-zero goals by 2050.

US Succeeds in Blocking Global Carbon Tax on Ships for Now

Wind propulsion technology has also gained renewed attention, with support from various countries and industry data reinforcing its potential. Anaïs Rios, Senior Shipping Policy Officer at Seas At Risk, remarked that while the Net Zero Framework may be delayed, the momentum for implementing wind propulsion solutions remains strong. She urged governments to ensure that guidelines facilitate the widespread adoption of this technology, which can significantly reduce emissions and operational costs. Jenny Helle, an expert on decarbonization, warned against scaling back ambitions at this critical juncture, emphasizing the need for clear, enforceable guidelines that support the transition to cleaner shipping fuels and technologies.",https://nauticalvoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/cropped-Nautical-Voice-150x150.jpeg,N,,2025-10-28 02:17:29.342924

James Helliwell, commercial director for decarbonisation at V, said: “The IMO’s decision to delay the Net Zero Framework for a year marks a profound setback for global shipping decarbonisation.

The pause underscores the need for persistence and verifiable proof that zero-emission technologies are practical, competitive, and reliable in operation.”

He went on to say that during this delay its imperative that industry has to deliver tangible projects with verifiable performance data to persuade hesitant stakeholders including shipowners, fleet operators and the all important investors.

“The future will be shaped by pioneers who lead, project by project,” he added.

Others aren’t nearly as optimistic as PowerCell’s Berkling. James Helliwell, commercial director for decarbonisation at V, said: “The IMO’s decision to delay the Net Zero Framework for a year marks a profound setback for global shipping decarbonisation. The delay - and potential abandonment - of unified global measures opens the door to a patchwork of regional carbon schemes. This means shipowners may face multiple, overlapping carbon taxes for the same emissions whilst navigating inconsistent regional standards without the level playing field that IMO measures would have provided.”

I alluded to the issues of having regional regulations as opposed to a global standard but Helliwell has explained the problems the lack of an IMO framework presents succinctly.

He does imply that there are green shots of optimism despite the setback, stating: “The industry’s decarbonisation imperative hasn’t disappeared; it has simply become more complex and costly. The 2023 IMO GHG Strategy targets remain, even as the pathway to achieving them becomes increasingly unclear.”

He went on to say that given the outcome ship managers will now play an essential role in helping companies navigate what will inevitably become a more fragmented regulatory landscape. He points to his own company V.’s integrated ship management platform, which includes performance optimisation tools and decarbonisation initiatives, that will aid owners and operators in meeting what may be fragmented requirements whilst maintaining operational efficiency and commercial competitiveness.

One segment of the maritime industry which was particularly seeking clarification over the Net Zero Framework was LNG suppliers/users. The industry body representing that fuel, SEA-LNG, said it will use the delay time to work with its members and other industry organizations to continue to develop meaningful, scientific studies to support the IMO’s critical work.

Again, SEA-LNG see the outcome of the IMO meeting in a more positive light than others. It stated: “The industry will continue on the road to decarbonisation. The methane pathway is currently the only practical, realistic and scalable solution to the decarbonisation of the global maritime industry, as demonstrated by the rapid growth in the LNG dual-fuel fleet and new build orderbook.”

The group pointed to the work done by engine manufacturers to reduce methane slip as well as the growing availability of biomethane and gradual introduction of e-methane as evidence that LNG has a longer lifespan than those who dismiss it as a fossil fuel would suggest.

The appointment comes as ABS Group has been recognized by Forbes Magazine as one of the world’s best management consulting firms for two consecutive years.

“ABS Group is a recognized safety leader with world class capabilities in process safety, risk management and asset performance management,” Wechsler said. “This is a great foundation to build on. I am proud to lead their incredible team and support their mission to improve performance and reduce risk in a changing world.”

The leadership change follows Wiernicki’s announcement in April that he would retire at the end of 2025 after a 14-year tenure as Chairman and CEO of the American Bureau of Shipping. Under his leadership, ABS achieved substantial growth in 2024, with its fleet expanding to 300 million gross tons while maintaining a 22 percent global new order share.

Current ABS President and Chief Operating Officer John McDonald is expected to assume the role of Chairman and CEO starting January 1, 2026, pending Board of Directors approval.

During his tenure, Wiernicki navigated the organization through challenges including the pandemic, the marine and offshore industry downturn, and technology and regulatory changes. “In spite of these events, we were able to move forward with a number of strategic investments that have allowed us to become an industry recognized technology and safety leader,” Wiernicki stated.

In September, at London International Shipping Week 2025, Wiernicki underscored the human element in maritime operations. “Behind every smart ship, every digital dashboard, and every data stream, there is still a human being making critical decisions,” he said. “Investment in their training and continuous development is essential. It is not just about efficiency, it’s about dignity, safety, and long-term resilience.”

Wiernicki has been vocal about the maritime industry’s regulatory challenges, particularly regarding the IMO Net Zero Framework. “Shipping and the IMO are on different trajectories,” he stated at the launch of the 2025 ABS Sustainability Outlook. “There is no clear pathway for green fuel availability and scalability and infrastructure support. The industry needs a framework but we need one that marries ambition with reality.”

Riviera’s LNG Shipping and Terminals Conference returns to London in November 2026.","LNG remains a robust long-term pillar of energy security, offering unprecedented opportunity across the value chain, delegates at this year’s LNG Shipping and Terminals Conference heard.

Substantial and accelerated growth in LNG supply was forecast, expected to trigger the lower prices needed to stimulate new demand, particularly across emerging Asian economies. Lower LNG prices are also driving growth in the FSRU market, creating new opportunities to convert older LNG carriers into FSRU or FSU units.

The solid orderbook extending to 2028 reflects deep confidence in future demand. Fleet renewal is being driven by proactive responses to regulatory change, turning compliance mandates into strategic modernisation opportunities. Key discussions centred on how to navigate the complexities of the EU ETS, FuelEU Maritime and IMO’s Net-Zero Framework to future-proof assets.

BioLNG was recognised as the most cost-effective option for meeting immediate FuelEU requirements, providing a practical pathway to decarbonise fleets. Delegates also examined continuous emissions monitoring systems, which can deliver immediate EU ETS cost savings through more accurate data. Further optimisation is being achieved via AI and virtualisation in route and terminal operations, while wind-assisted propulsion systems, such as rotor sails, are achieving estimated fuel savings of 5–7 tonnes a day on LNG carriers.

Methane slip, which varies widely by engine type and load condition, is prompting manufacturers to guarantee engine performance and accelerate the development of abatement technologies. Solutions under consideration include converting existing engines to spark-ignited gas systems to reduce slip immediately. At the same time, concerns around LNG heavies, the heavier, long-chain hydrocarbons (C6+ compounds) present in LNG cargoes, highlighted the need to standardise testing protocols and address legal gaps in charter parties related to cargo quality. There was also considerable interest in a new approach for safer, simpler, smarter LNG transfer put forward by Trelleborg, built around tighter training, better data and smarter co-operation.

As always, the conference delivered valuable networking opportunities, including a lively drinks reception and dinner. Attendees gave high marks to the conference app, which enabled networking, access to presentations, and live participation in Q&A sessions. Some 267 questions were submitted over the two days.

On this symbolic day, the UK reminded departing delegates that the IMO stands as a testament to what nations can achieve together. The Chair, Sveinung Oftedal, closed the meeting by reminding Member States that they are united by a shared cause, rooted in expertise and mutual respect.

We have a year – time that can be used to strengthen, align, and advocate for a robust global framework. The Center will use this year to continue our support for the development of guidelines, to broaden consensus, and to maintain industry momentum toward a global framework that can provide certainty, incentives, and a just transition.

According to MMMCZCS, though the Net-Zero Framework (NZF) was not adopted, the Chair reassured delegates that real progress was made and that the next intersessional will go further still. While the decision to postpone by one year was not the outcome that was hoped for, it is far from defeat for decarbonization.

The NZF was built upon the 2023 IMO GHG Strategy, which was unanimously adopted in 2023 and was approved by an overwhelming majority back in April. The NZF remains a sound market-based policy, broadly supported by industry, that can provide the needed certainty of a single global framework, while supporting a just transition for developing countries.

In an exclusive interview to SAFETY4SEA, Kasper Møller Nielsen, Sustainability Partner at Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller Center for Zero Carbon Shipping, emphasized that collaboration is essential to addressing the challenges of the transition.

Furthermore, developing the comprehensive guidelines necessary to implement a framework of this scale was always going to be a daunting task. The coming year provides time to make sure that these guidelines are robust and that more countries can be confident in supporting adoption. The productive intersessional discussions on guidelines following the extraordinary MEPC showed that constructive dialogue remains at the heart of the IMO.

Commitment to decarbonization will continue to shape the industry – especially with existing regional and national measures supporting the business case for sustainable investments. Postponement does not change the need to invest, experiment, learn, and begin to scale solutions that reduce emissions, MMMCZCS explained.

Over the next year, the Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller Center for Zero Carbon Shipping underlines its support IMO Member States in developing effective guidelines, provide clarity to the industry where possible, and engage in global dialogue to address concerns. The process will be challenging, but the Center remains committed to fostering collaboration among Member States and the maritime sector to enable the adoption of the NZF.

We are disappointed with the decision to postpone this crucial meeting by one year. The effects of climate change do not wait, and our dedication and work continue stronger than ever. We appreciate the leadership of many Member States in the room and stand ready to continue our work to support the IMO.

That’s not a distance problem – that’s a consistency problem. Voyage-level visibility turns those hidden differences into actionable insight for shippers and forwarders

… Eduardo Ramos, Senior Data Analyst at OceanScore, added that short-sea operations are less predictable than long-haul ones, with every delay or underutilized sailing compounding emissions and cost exposure.

Carrier consistency: The new benchmark for Scope 3 efficiency

Carrier selection therefore plays a decisive role on feeder-dominated routes. Opting for high-volume, lower-intensity operators can materially reduce Scope 3 exposure, while reliance on volatile feeders risks inflated totals.

Carriers with narrower, more stable distributions offer predictable Scope 3 outcomes, whereas those with wider spreads increase reporting uncertainty and cost pass-through risk.

“Consistency is the new benchmark,” said Smith. “You can’t control if a ship sails full or half-empty – but you can choose carriers who operate predictably and efficiently.”

Key Area Data Point Takeaway Variability 9–80 gCO₂/t-km range (10× gap) Operational consistency drives efficiency, not ship size. Feeder Impact 40–60 gCO₂/t-km vs 7–16 for larger ships Feeder volatility inflates Scope 3 totals. Delays 9.3 → 38.1 gCO₂/t-km (2-day idle) A single port delay can quadruple emissions. Carrier Performance Arkas (17.8), MSC (20.3), Maersk (19.8), CMA (24.0), X-Press (30.3), Boluda (30.1) Consistency matters more than size or distance. Utilization & Speed 70% load = 20–30% less CO₂; +1 knot = +5% CO₂ Steady utilization and speed discipline are key reduction levers for Scope 3 emissions. Reporting Accuracy EU ETS & FuelEU make averages obsolete Voyage-level data prevents cost overstatement.

Utilization drives efficiency and predictability

OceanScore data reveals that most voyages operate between 37–67% utilization, with higher load factors strongly correlating with lower carbon intensity per tonne. CMA CGM records the highest proportion of heavily loaded voyages (52–72%), MSC shows wider variability, and Maersk maintains the most balanced performance, clustering between 57–67%.

A vessel operating at 70% utilization emits roughly 20–30% less CO₂ per tonne-kilometre than one at 50%. Across the corridor, MSC generally shows better efficiency, CMA CGM higher average intensity, and Maersk steady mid-range performance.

The melting snow and ice exposes darker areas of land and water and these dark patches then absorb further heat from the sun and the reflective capacity of the planet’s polar ice caps is severely reduced.
The need to reduce emissions of black carbon because of both the climate and health impacts has been long recognised.","NGOs call on ministers meeting in Stockholm to back IMO regulation on polar fuels

Ahead of next week’s session of the Nordic Council, the Clean Arctic Alliance today called on Nordic governments to adopt a resolution on polar fuels during the meeting, and together commit to support an International Maritime Organization (IMO) regulation that would require cleaner maritime fuels, which would result in lower emissions of black carbon by ships when operating in the Arctic.

The deadline for concrete proposals for such a regulation to be submitted to the thirteenth session of the IMO’s technical committee that addresses pollution prevention and response (PPR13, February 2026) is December 5th.

“Ahead of a crucial meeting of the IMO next February, the Clean Arctic Alliance is calling for the Member States of the International Maritime Organization to develop and adopt a mandatory regulation which would require that only polar fuels can be used by shipping in the Arctic”, said Dr Sian Prior, Lead Advisorto the Clean Arctic Alliance. “A resolution on polar fuels adopted by Nordic governments next week would send a strong message to IMO Member States that action is urgently needed to protect the Arctic from the impacts of shipping emissions.”

“Black carbon is a climate superpollutant produced when fossil fuels are burned”, said Prior. “Black carbon has a disproportionate impact because it both heats the atmosphere – and when released from ship exhausts and when near to the Arctic it settles onto snow and ice, speeding up the melting and exposing darker land and sea beneath, which continue to absorb more heat. It is the loss of the planet’s reflectivity – or albedo – which is contributing to the fast pace of warming seen in the Arctic.”

“Black carbon emissions from ships burning oil-based fuels have more than doubled in the last decade, yet a simple and easy solution is to require shipping to use widely available distillate fuels with lower black carbon emissions when operating in and near to the Arctic”, said Prior.

About Black Carbon, Polar Fuels, and the Arctic

Black carbon is a short-lived climate pollutant, produced by the incomplete burning of fossil fuels, with an impact more than three thousand times that of CO2 over a 20 year period. It makes up around one-fifth of international shipping’s climate impact. Not only does it contribute to warming while in the atmosphere, black carbon accelerates melting if deposited onto snow and ice – hence it has a disproportionate impact when released in and near to the Arctic.

The melting snow and ice exposes darker areas of land and water and these dark patches then absorb further heat from the sun and the reflective capacity of the planet’s polar ice caps is severely reduced. More heat in the polar systems – results in increased melting. This is the loss of the albedo effect.

Declines in sea ice extent and volume are leading to a burgeoning social and environmental crisis in the Arctic, while cascading changes are impacting global climate and ocean circulation. Scientists have high confidence that processesare nearing points beyond which rapid and irreversible changes on the scale of multiple human generations are possible. Scientists say it is now too late to save summer Arctic sea ice, and research has shown that “preparations need to be made for the increased extreme weather across the northern hemisphere that is likely to occur as a result.”

Black carbon also has a negative impact on human health including premature death and harmful effects on the cardiovascular system (heart, blood and blood vessels), and recent research has found black carbon particles in the body tissues of foetuses, following inhalation by pregnant mothers.

The need to reduce emissions of black carbon because of both the climate and health impacts has been long recognised. On land, considerable effort has been made to ban dirtier fuels in power stations, to install diesel particulate filters on land-based transport, and to improve the burning of dry wood – all to reduce emissions of black carbon and improve air quality. However, at sea the same efforts have not yet been made.",https://cyprusshippingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/New-Project-5-3.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 13:00:32.890776

The IMO’s proposed global carbon tax should be a wake-up call to the U.N.-EU attempt to impose a sweeping radical climate agenda on all countries.","The United States should take necessary action to kill off the IMO global carbon tax.

T he United States should be an international leader in the fight against energy poverty and for energy freedom.

Because, as of now, many countries are using their power through international bodies to impose their harmful, anti-energy climate agenda on countries who don’t share their ideological objectives.

This problem has recently been highlighted by the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) proposed global carbon tax on the shipping industry. Until just a few days ago the IMO, a specialized agency of the United Nations, was set to impose its “Net-Zero Framework,” what is in effect a tax on carbon dioxide emissions from ships that exceed certain thresholds to be paid for by shipping companies. The IMO would have collected the revenue and then distributed it for such things as rewarding “low-emission ships” and for U.N. income redistribution schemes to “mitigate negative [climate] impacts on vulnerable States.”

This tax is especially egregious because it is a violation of the sovereignty of the U.S. and other nations. A U.N. international body would be imposing a tax on Americans, something that appears to be a first. The tax, according to the State Department, could increase global shipping costs by 10 percent or more.

It’s also yet another example of Europe and the U.N. trying to dictate the domestic climate policies of other countries. The State Department made it clear that it understood the fundamental problem this posed when it stated that the U.S. would penalize nations “that sponsor this European-led neocolonial export of global climate regulations.”

Fortunately, the Trump administration helped to delay a vote on the IMO tax plan for a year, but it is still looming. A tax delayed is not a tax canceled.

The IMO tax, though, is far from the only effort to impose climate policies on other countries. This past July, the U.N.’s top court, the International Court of Justice, issued a nonbinding advisory opinion that reads more like a climate manifesto than an example of logical legal reasoning. It concluded that member states have a duty to reduce and regulate greenhouse gas emissions.

It also stated the “failure of a State to take appropriate action to protect the climate system from GHG [Greenhouse Gas] emissions — including through fossil fuel production, fossil fuel consumption, the granting of fossil fuel exploration licenses or the provision of fossil fuel subsidies — may constitute an internationally wrongful act which is attributable to that State.”

While a nonbinding opinion, there is a very real possibility that this opinion will be used in various ways to justify greenhouse gas regulation in policy contexts across the world, as well as in litigation in other jurisdictions.

Then there’s the European Union’s carbon border adjustment mechanism, which is in effect a carbon tax imposed on goods based on their carbon intensity (i.e. how much carbon dioxide is emitted during production). The EU’s reason for the tax is clear: “to encourage cleaner industrial production in non-EU countries.”

Once again, here’s that “European-led neocolonial export of global climate regulations.” The EU isn’t imposing a tax based on the specific attributes of a good itself. Instead, it’s trying to use trade to influence and change the climate policies and production methods of other countries, in part to protect what remains of European industries as decarbonization bites.

It isn’t enough that EU nations have adopted harmful policies that punish energy use and increase prices for their own citizens. They need to make sure other countries hurt themselves too, including developing countries that need fossil fuels to advance the well-being of their citizens.

The world can go down a misguided path of restricting energy to address climate change. Or nations can collaborate to unleash energy, innovation, and abundance to improve the lives of individuals today while also being in a much better position to address any real environmental challenges that arise, including any connected to climate change.

The United States should certainly take whatever action is needed to kill the IMO global carbon tax as well as the climate hysteria that is engrained right now in almost all of the work of the U.N. It also shouldn’t tolerate the EU’s carbon tax on goods.

But our country can’t just be on defense, we need to be on offense, too. This requires leading nations in an effort to reject climate extremism and to help solve energy poverty by allowing countries to use energy as they deem fit to meet their own objectives.

There are around 750 million people in the world without electricity. According to the World Bank, there are about 2 billion people “without access to safely managed drinking water services.” There are also about 700 million people who live in extreme poverty, defined as surviving on less than $2.15 per day.

Developing countries have more important issues to worry about than climate change. Getting rid of affordable and reliable energy isn’t just unjustified, it is, given the struggles of so many of their people, immoral. And the need for affordable and reliable energy is certainly not limited to developing countries. It’s a necessity for all nations.

The IMO’s proposed global carbon tax should be a wake-up call to the U.N.-EU attempt to impose a sweeping radical climate agenda on all countries.",,N,,2025-10-27 13:00:45.156120

Redefining the Green Corridor Sommadossi said the events of the past week should also trigger a broader rethink of what constitutes a truly green shipping corridor.
The future of green shipping will be built, not negotiated.”","Member States of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) have voted to delay for one year the adoption of draft amendments to MARPOL Annex VI, which would have created the world’s first truly global carbon-pricing mechanism for shipping. The decision, taken at the second extraordinary session of the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC/ES.2) held in London from 14–17 October 2025, marks a setback for international decarbonization efforts, in favor of a status quo that benefit oil and gas producers but not shipowners, investors and ports already under pressure to meet tightening emissions targets.

The postponement leaves the sector without a formal global market framework just as regional regulation is gathering pace, from Europe’s maritime carbon pricing to new clean-port standards in Asia and North America. NatPower Marine said the outcome underlines the growing gap between political negotiation and industry action, as ports and shipping lines continue to invest in clean-energy infrastructure despite the lack of a global mechanism.

Stefano D.M. Sommadossi, CEO of NatPower Marine and NatPower UK, said: “While the IMO’s postponement is disappointing, it cannot be a pause button for the industry. Shore power and near-shore electrification are proven, scalable and capable of delivering deep emissions cuts today. Every corridor we electrify removes thousands of tons of CO2, NOx and SOx from the system while improving air quality for coastal communities. The opportunity to lead is now, not in a year’s time.”

He continued: “No sector has got regulation before innovation, it has always been the other way round. Airplanes, cars, radio, Internet, AI were invented and adopted before regulation, and regulation followed the path set by innovators.

It is clear that the larger players and most innovative shipping operators and owners have already decided to go green because it is a strategic advantage and a cost cutting option in the years to come. So innovators and initiators will progress during this regulatory postponement. We at NatPower are accelerating our plan to deliver near shore electric propulsion and cold ironing in 120 locations globally.”

The potential losers of this postponement are the emerging countries that were relying on IMO global carbon pricing to finance investments. The good news is that those investments can be made with private capital, provided that their locations are included in the green corridors and routes of the initiators.

New electric fuel for ships is already benefitting from the sheer convenience and it is a low hanging fruit for decarbonization, and it is happening right now. Without waiting to choose among different alternative cleaner molecules (e-methanol, ammonia and hydrogen), the immediate opportunity is near shore electric propulsions and cold ironing.

The existing regulations in EU and China, and their ambitions to become the powerhouses of Energy Transition, are more than sufficient to trigger adoption and change.

Across Europe, Asia and the Americas, a wave of electrification projects, from single-port upgrades to full Green Corridors, is building a global network of clean maritime routes. It shows what genuine international cooperation can achieve when backed by real infrastructure and investment.

Green Shipping Corridors: the model for immediate progress

Through its investment in true Green Shipping Corridors, NatPower Marine is connecting high-traffic maritime routes with clean electricity for propulsion and cold ironing, replacing fossil-fuel use both in port and on near-shore legs. The company is planning to invest more than £3 billion to deliver 120 clean-port locations by 2030, creating an integrated global network of zero-emission maritime energy hubs.

For example, the corridor between Heysham Port and Northern Ireland, developed in partnership with Peel Ports Group, has started construction. It will eliminate more than 10,000 tons of CO2 annually from Irish Sea routes and forms part of a wider £250 million UK rollout of shore-power and e-ship-charging infrastructure.

Sommadossi said: “The IMO’s delay underlines the challenge of reaching consensus at a global level. But while negotiations stall, regional regulation is accelerating, and the landscape is becoming more fragmented. The EU Emissions Trading System now prices maritime emissions, and FuelEU Maritime sets carbon-intensity limits for vessels trading in Europe. The UK is preparing to bring shipping into its own ETS, Singapore is expanding its network of green corridors, and California is already enforcing at-berth emission rules. The message is clear: decarbonization is no longer waiting for a single global mechanism, it is happening route by route, region by region.”

This patchwork of regional measures is driving urgency for practical, scalable solutions that can operate across multiple regulatory systems. As global policy tightens, the infrastructure to deliver compliance and emissions reduction is struggling to keep pace, creating both challenge and opportunity for the industry.

That urgency is echoed in new research showing the accelerating pace of green-shipping regulation and innovation worldwide.

According to the World Maritime University (WMU) and the Shanghai International Shipping Institute (SISI) in their Global Green Shipping Development Report (2024–2025), regulatory pressure on ports and shipping is now accelerating across all major economies.

The WMU/SISI report also confirms that ports are increasingly being recognized as the key enablers of maritime decarbonization, with shore power expected to become a mandatory standard in many jurisdictions. The study highlights that “ships in ports will use more shore power or zero-carbon energy in the future” as emission requirements tighten, a view strongly echoed by NatPower Marine.

“This global trend validates our approach,” said Sommadossi. “Shore power and e-charging infrastructure are not optional extras; they are the foundation for clean shipping. Every port that plugs, in our standardized network, becomes part of the global energy transition.”

Energy integration: powering the maritime transition

To ensure clean electricity is available where and when vessels need it, NatPower Marine is supported by 20 GW of renewable generation and over 100 GWh of battery-storage capacity developed by its parent, NatPower Group. Located in strategic coastal regions, these assets deliver stable, low-cost renewable power through private-wire connections and smart Power Purchase Agreements, supporting vessel charging and port operations without burdening national grids.

This integrated approach forms what Sommadossi describes as “the backbone of a clean-shipping network,” linking renewable generation directly to maritime demand and enabling real decarbonization today.

NatPower Marine believes the IMO’s delay could, paradoxically, open space for innovation and collaboration. While waiting for a global mechanism, countries, ports and fleets can lead the way and show what success looks like by developing their own clean-energy routes, projects that cut emissions while creating industrial and economic growth.

Redefining the Green Corridor

Sommadossi said the events of the past week should also trigger a broader rethink of what constitutes a truly green shipping corridor.

“So far, most green corridors have been defined around alternative fuels and fuel-supply routes,” he said. “But that only addresses part of the challenge. A true green corridor must include the full chain of clean-energy infrastructure, from shore power and propulsion charging to renewable generation and grid integration. That is the only way to deliver zero-emission voyages from berth to berth, at an affordable cost.”

He added that NatPower Marine’s approach, combining e-ship charging, port-grid integration and large-scale battery storage, offers a practical blueprint for this next generation of corridors.

“If the past week has shown anything,” he concluded, “it is that we cannot wait for definitions and policy to catch up with reality. The future of green shipping will be built, not negotiated.”",https://www.ajot.com/images/uploads/article/_large/Stefano-Sommadossi-CEO-NatPower.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 13:00:54.934057
