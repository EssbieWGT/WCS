“We have been transporting ammonia for 25 years,” observed Navigator Gas chief executive, Mads Peter Zacho, “but this is a first for us to use it as a fuel.” Navigator Gas, through a new 80% owned JV, Navigator Amon Shipping, has ordered two 51,530-m3 ammonia dual fuel-powered liquefied ammonia carriers from China’s Nantong CIMC Sinopacific Offshore & Engineering Co, Ltd.
Capable of transporting ammonia and LPG, these vessels will be the largest in the company’s fleet when they are delivered in June and October 2028.
“We are very confident that clean ammonia will be a successful marine fuel,” said Mr Zacho, addressing the question of availability and regulatory drivers during a Capital Link webinar.
There’s great resolve in the industry to make clean ammonia a successful marine fuel, and we think that it’s going to be a significant proportion of the alternative fuel consumption.”","As one of the largest owners and operators of handysize liquefied gas carriers in the world, Navigator Gas has been in the business of transporting ammonia for more than two decades. But the Big Board-listed company is “breaking new ice” with ammonia as a fuel with the aid of a multi-million dollar grant from Enova and a joint venture with Norwegian maritime development company, Amon Maritime.

“We have been transporting ammonia for 25 years,” observed Navigator Gas chief executive, Mads Peter Zacho, “but this is a first for us to use it as a fuel.”

Navigator Gas, through a new 80% owned JV, Navigator Amon Shipping, has ordered two 51,530-m3 ammonia dual fuel-powered liquefied ammonia carriers from China’s Nantong CIMC Sinopacific Offshore & Engineering Co, Ltd. Capable of transporting ammonia and LPG, these vessels will be the largest in the company’s fleet when they are delivered in June and October 2028. The two newbuilds cost about US$84M per vessel and are underpinned by grants totalling Nrk180M (about US$18M) from Norwegian government agency, Enova, which supports clean energy R&D projects.

“This is a first for us to use it as a fuel”

Mr Zacho said the order represented “an incredibly important step for us in preparing for the future,” noting it follows “suit on our commitment to have net-zero operations by 2050.”

When delivered, the gas carriers will operate under a five-year charter carrying ammonia for a “blue-chip industry leader”. While vessels will be dual-fuel propulsion, Mr Zacho expects that for the first five years they will be burning ammonia as a fuel most of the time.

“We are very confident that clean ammonia will be a successful marine fuel,” said Mr Zacho, addressing the question of availability and regulatory drivers during a Capital Link webinar. “In terms of regulation, the EU and the IMO have made very clear commitments to net-zero emission shipping by 2050 and that will lead to gradually higher penalties for emitting CO2, and that makes all types of clean fuels more competitive from 2030 onwards,” he stated.

Mr Zacho pointed to the increase in ammonia-fuelled newbuilding orders at shipyards, which stand at about 50 vessels, along with the progress being made by large two-stroke engine manufacturers, Everllence and WinGD on developing propulsion technology for the zero-carbon fuel.

Concluded Mr Zacho: “It’s still early days, but we already see the volumes in terms of newbuilding orders are ramping up, and we expect that there will be a quick learning curve in terms of building this technology. There’s great resolve in the industry to make clean ammonia a successful marine fuel, and we think that it’s going to be a significant proportion of the alternative fuel consumption.”",https://dvzpv6x5302g1.cloudfront.net/AcuCustom/Sitename/DAM/182/mads_peter_zacho_Navigator_Gas_source_ABSwebzhgfd1_Main.png,https://www.rivieramm.com/news-content-hub/navigator-gas-breaks-new-ice-with-ammonia-fuelled-carriers-86270,N,2025-09-30T14:32:16.992059
,,2025-09-30T16:54:04Z,www.hellenicshippingnews.com,Pacific to IMO: Fast-track the Net-Zero Fund or fail | Hellenic Shipping News Worldwide,Not Available,"Pacific leaders are calling for the International Maritime Organization (IMO) to fast-track setting up its Net-Zero Fund (NZF), warning that without urgent action the Organization will fail to deliver on its own commitment to contribute to a Just and Equitable Transition.. “Delay is the new denial,” said Hon.
IMO Member States have identified these revenues as a means to both incentivise shipping’s transition, and to contribute towards a Just and Equitable Transition.
Pacific states say this delay is unacceptable.
RMI Ambassador Albon Ishoda added, “Our 6PAC+ commitment to a Just and Equitable Transition remains true to a future that is 1.5 degree aligned.
The Pacific submission also makes clear that who governs the Fund matters as much as when it becomes operational.","Pacific leaders are calling for the International Maritime Organization (IMO) to fast-track setting up its Net-Zero Fund (NZF), warning that without urgent action the Organization will fail to deliver on its own commitment to contribute to a Just and Equitable Transition..

“Delay is the new denial,” said Hon. Ralph Regenvanu, Vanuatu’s Minister for Climate Change, Energy, Meteorology, Geohazards, Environment and Disaster Management. “By fast-tracking the Fund and ensuring equity in its governance, the IMO can prove it is serious about meeting its reduction targets — and serious about equity and justice for all nations. Without it, the IMO’s commitments collapse under its own weight.”

The Fund, designed to channel revenues from shipping, is expected to collect at least US $11–12 billion annually as a by-product of the regulation. IMO Member States have identified these revenues as a means to both incentivise shipping’s transition, and to contribute towards a Just and Equitable Transition.

But under the current IMO plan, the Fund’s governing provisions will not be adopted until 2028, meaning the support needed by SIDS and LDCs could be significantly delayed, at a time when they are urgently needed. Pacific states say this delay is unacceptable.

RMI Ambassador Albon Ishoda added, “Our 6PAC+ commitment to a Just and Equitable Transition remains true to a future that is 1.5 degree aligned. I will not compromise our communities to anything less than what the 2023 GHG Reduction Strategy called for.”

6PAC+ is a group of Pacific nations that includes Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Palau, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu, as well as alliances from Africa and the Caribbean.

Hon. Simon Kofe, Minister of Justice, Communication and Foreign Affairs, Tuvalu, highlighted the legal imperative: “Both the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea and the International Court of Justice have ruled that greenhouse gas emissions are marine pollution under UNCLOS. States have a duty to act consistently with this science and law. Delaying support to SIDS and LDCs would be inconsistent with that duty and with the IMO’s own Strategy.”

A submission to the IMO, co-sponsored by Fiji, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu, lays out a step-by-step accelerated timeline to fast-track the Fund’s creation, alongside temporary financing arrangements, such as interim loans or guarantees, so money can start flowing before shipping levy revenues arrive in 2029. It also spells out the core rules for how the Fund will be managed.

The goal is clear: make the Fund operational as soon as possible so it can start financing the shift to clean shipping, while ensuring that the countries most vulnerable to climate change — especially Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and Least Developed Countries (LDCs) — are put at the front of the line for support.

The Pacific submission also makes clear that who governs the Fund matters as much as when it becomes operational. Without equitable representation, the NZF risks being controlled by those least affected by both climate impacts, and the disproportionate negative impacts of the regulation (increase in transport costs) rather than those on the front lines.

The co-sponsors propose a 21-member governing board, divided equally: seven seats for Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and Least Developed Countries ( LDCs), seven seats for other developing countries, and seven seats for developed countries. Board members would serve three-year terms with staggered renewal to balance continuity and fresh perspectives. The proposal also includes rotating chairs and observer roles for NGOs, industry, and Indigenous representatives — measures that mirror best practice in other global environmental funds.

For Pacific economies — which rely almost entirely on shipping for food, fuel, and connectivity — the Fund’s design will determine whether they can withstand the expected additional increase in transport costs, and benefit from the substantial opportunities generated by the transition, or be left behind.

Hayes Moses of Palau Marine Transportation Bureau explained:“Our ports, ferries, and regional supply chains need urgent investment. We cannot afford to wait three more years for the Fund to trickle into operation. Fast-tracking the Fund and securing fair representation will allow small islands to chart a course toward resilient, clean, and affordable shipping.”

Pacific nations emphasise that readiness support cannot wait until 2029. Interim disbursements are critical to help vulnerable countries prepare their national systems, safeguard food security, and build the technical capacity required to access and deploy funds.

The proposals will be on the table when governments reconvene in London for two critical meetings: the Extraordinary Session of the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC ES/2) from 14–17 October, which will finalise and adopt the legal text of the Net-Zero Framework, and the Intersessional Working Group on Greenhouse Gas Emissions (ISWG-GHG 20) from 20–24 October, which will negotiate the detailed rules.",,https://www.hellenicshippingnews.com/pacific-to-imo-fast-track-the-net-zero-fund-or-fail/,N,2025-09-30T14:32:23.478550

The region’s shipping community is increasingly aware of the need to cut emissions and is taking steps towards decarbonization. While progress is uneven, responses from shipping companies, ports, suppliers, and civil society point to both growing awareness and readiness to act, particularly in relation to skills, safety, infrastructure, and alternative fuels.

These are the findings of Wave 1 of the large-scale METAVASEA survey, conducted between June and November 2024 prior to the adoption of the IMO Net-Zero Framework at MEPC 83.

It is worth noting that citizens believe that shipping emissions account for between 50–70% of total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, while they are approximately 3%.

In total, 898 responses were collected from across the maritime community, including shipping companies, seafarers, ports, suppliers, and civil society.

Key insights from shipping companies and seafarers:

Strategic alignment with IMO climate regulations is progressing but uneven, with 74% of respondents stating that their companies are either already aligned or have planned to align with IMO net-zero targets.

Awareness of the need for robust emissions management is increasing among shipping companies, with a focus largely on direct (Scope 1) emissions (73%), while 9% and 4% of companies monitor Scope 2 (indirect energy use) and Scope 3 (supply chain) emissions, respectively.

Biofuels lead the transition, but uncertainty remains. Biofuels are the most widely adopted or planned fuel alternative (62%), with green hydrogen (25%) and ammonia (19%) gaining interest. Still, 42% of respondents express concerns about fuel compatibility and infrastructure gaps.

Technological immaturity, high costs, vessel compatibility and regulatory complexity are the main barriers to wider adoption of technology upgrades. Novel technologies like onboard carbon capture, wind and solar power, and air lubrication face additional skepticism due to uncertain performance and safety concerns.

Crew fatigue tops seafarer concerns. Crew fatigue, driven by regulatory pressure and added workload, is ranked as the top safety concern by 70% of respondents. This is followed by inadequate training (27%) and unfamiliarity with new fuels (26%). Engineers and less experienced crew report the highest levels of concern.

Widespread training gaps identified. 64% of seafarers reported no decarbonization-related training in the past two years. Among those trained, only a small fraction had exposure to content on alternative fuels, emissions monitoring, or new digital systems.

In-house training prevails, but external providers play a role. 61% of training is delivered in-house, reflecting companies’ active role. However, among the 39% who trained through external providers, satisfaction rates were significantly higher, especially for courses on new fuels and technology.

Soft and technical skills are evolving in parallel, with both seafarers and shipping company staff equally prioritizing safety skills such as risk assessment and management, understanding decarbonization technologies and energy management systems, organizational skills like planning and prioritization, as well as soft skills including leadership, teamwork, and critical thinking, underscoring the need for a holistic approach to prepare for the safety and operational challenges of maritime decarbonization.

Fleet size shapes sustainability readiness. Large fleets (>50 vessels) are more advanced in emissions tracking (over 80%), ESG strategy implementation, and uptake of new technologies. Small fleets (<10 vessels) focus primarily on compliance and basic awareness, often citing limited resources.

Support for tailored upskilling is critical. The need for specialized training varies significantly by vessel type and role. LNG and tanker crews prioritize fuel handling and safety, while passenger vessel personnel call for training in environmental awareness and life cycle assessments. Office staff increasingly require cross-functional skills in decarbonization strategy and compliance.

Key insights from ports, suppliers, and civil society:

Misconception in civil society about shipping’s GHG emissions. 41% rate this contribution as high (over 70% of total emissions) or average (around 50% of total emissions), compared to the actual approximately 3% of total GHG emissions.

Port infrastructure for low-carbon fuels is still limited, while only 20% of the ports provide Very Low Sulfur Fuel Oil (VLSFO) bunkering, even though the Mediterranean Sea has become a SOx Emission Control Area as of May 2025.

Onshore power systems (OPS) are the most common planned initiative, by 40% of the ports. On the other hand, another 40% of ports reported no planned interventions.

Renewable energy installations (70%), cold ironing (40%) and alternative fuels bunkering stations (30%) are top decarbonization priorities for ports. Renewable energy sources (47%) were identified also by service providers and suppliers as the most effective investment for port decarbonization.

Regulatory compliance regarding emissions monitoring remains a challenge for ports, since 60% have no emissions monitoring systems in place.

Environmental Management System (EMS) adoption remains limited across many ports with ISO14001 (70%) and ISO9001 (60%) being the most common framework adopted. On the other hand, 56% of service providers and suppliers implement an EMS, primarily ISO14001.

Transitional fuels show varied familiarity and preferences. LNG is the most familiar alternative fuel (59%) among civil society and port cities, with reduced CO2 emissions cited as its main benefit (76%); it is also the most preferred by service providers and suppliers (41%). However, uncertainty remains about the best fuel pathway, with 39% of civil society participants unsure which alternative fuel is most promising for reducing carbon emissions.

Lack of trained personnel in LNG handling was identified as a key barrier (58%) for alternative or transitional fuel adoption by representatives of civil society.

MARPOL regulations and marine environmental awareness are the top training priorities for port workers, with key skills requirements including Understanding Decarbonization Technologies, Risk Assessment and Hazardous Material Handling, Understanding Decarbonization Strategies and Marine Environmental Awareness, Effective Planning and Prioritization for Decarbonization, Teamwork and Critical Thinking.

Climate awareness is high in civil society and port cities. 67% consider themselves to be very familiar or extremely familiar with the causes and impacts of global warming, and 97% are concerned about its effects on the local environment. The vast majority (86%) of respondents agree or strongly agree that emissions are the primary cause of global warming.

78% of civil society representatives consider as very high the importance of maritime decarbonization for the sustainability of the East Mediterranean marine environment.

Conducted within the framework of the METAVASEA project, which adopts a people-centered approach to maritime decarbonization in the Eastern Mediterranean, a region of strategic importance due to its dense shipping traffic and dynamic port systems, these survey findings form part of a broader effort to map the infrastructure and skills required for the green transition.

Launched in 2023, METAVASEA (Greek for “transition”) is a five-year initiative running through 2027, coordinated by the Hellenic Marine Environment Protection Association (HELMEPA) with the strategic and financial support of Lloyd’s Register Foundation. The project brings together six partners, twelve associate partners, and more than sixty contributing stakeholders across the region, a network that continues to grow.

The survey will continue throughout the METAVASEA project until September 2027, enabling ongoing analysis and updates that reflect evolving trends, challenges, and capacity-building needs in the region.

Their joint three-year framework agreement targets Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions and centres around the use of sustainable marine fuels in Hapag-Lloyd’s fleet.
These non-food-based fuels avoid the land-use challenges associated with first-generation biofuels, offering a cleaner alternative to conventional marine fuels.
""The signing of this three-year framework agreement marks a crucial step toward realising our shared vision of a decarbonised shipping industry,"" says Casper Ellerbaek, Head of Global Ocean Freight at DHL Global Forwarding.
Together, DHL and Hapag-Lloyd are using sustainable fuels and transparent tracking systems to cut emissions and help customers take climate action.","It's no secret that global shipping is under pressure to decarbonise.

The International Maritime Organization (IMO) warns that maritime emissions could climb by as much as 130% by 2050 compared to 2008 levels.

Almost 3% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions come from maritime shipping, but it is also the most efficient way of transporting large quantities of goods around the globe.

This leaves the industry between a rock and a hard place, but nonetheless, businesses are rising to the mounting pressure from regulators and consumers, working to offer cleaner logistics solutions.

DHL Global Forwarding and Hapag-Lloyd have teamed up to do just that.

Their joint three-year framework agreement targets Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions and centres around the use of sustainable marine fuels in Hapag-Lloyd’s fleet.

In July 2025, the first order under this agreement cut 25,000 tonnes CO2 equivalent (CO2e) well-to-wake emissions, referring to the full lifecycle emissions of the fuel from production to combustion.

The fuels in question are second-generation biofuels, made from waste and residue feedstock. These non-food-based fuels avoid the land-use challenges associated with first-generation biofuels, offering a cleaner alternative to conventional marine fuels.

""The signing of this three-year framework agreement marks a crucial step toward realising our shared vision of a decarbonised shipping industry,"" says Casper Ellerbaek, Head of Global Ocean Freight at DHL Global Forwarding.

""We are thrilled to partner with Hapag-Lloyd in driving the adoption of sustainable marine fuels and the book and claim mechanism, ultimately empowering our customers to achieve their climate goals.""

DHL has committed to net-zero GHG emissions by 2050, while Hapag-Lloyd is targeting net-zero fleet emissions by 2045.

How book and claim works

The agreement also brings the ""book and claim"" model into the spotlight.

The system allows emission reductions to be tracked and claimed even when the low-emission fuel isn't physically used in a customer’s specific shipment. This separates the environmental benefit from the physical delivery route, enabling wider uptake of sustainable fuels despite current supply constraints.

The model plays a vital role in encouraging early decarbonisation as biofuels remain in short supply and are often more expensive than traditional marine fuel oil. By decoupling use from impact, book and claim enables a broader range of companies to participate in reducing emissions.

""We are delighted to have completed this order with DHL, demonstrating the feasibility and effectiveness of using sustainable marine fuels to reduce Scope 3 emissions through our Ship Green product,"" adds Danny Smolders, Managing Director Global Sales at Hapag-Lloyd.

""Partnering with DHL shows how powerful collaboration can be. Together, we are creating real momentum in further decarbonizing supply chains, one bold step at a time.""

Hapag-Lloyd started deploying second-generation biofuels in 2020, whilst it launched Ship Green – a lower-emission ocean transport product – in 2023, enabling customers to claim emissions reductions from biofuel blends used in its fleet.

Logistics with fewer emissions

DHL’s GoGreen Plus line plays a similar role across the company’s wider transport services. Built on the book and claim principle, GoGreen Plus helps customers reduce Scope 3 emissions tied to both upstream and downstream logistics – including road, air and sea.

These products support businesses in voluntary GHG reporting and progress against internal climate goals. Rather than offering token offsets, DHL focuses on real, measurable value chain emissions reductions.

The shared goal is consistent: push the logistics industry toward low-carbon operations – requiring collaboration, practical tools and clear reporting frameworks.

It found rising awareness of climate obligations, but also persistent gaps in infrastructure, training and technology.

According to the findings, 74 per cent of shipping company respondents said they were already aligned or planning to align with the IMO’s net-zero targets, though progress remains uneven.

Most focus is placed on direct emissions (73 per cent), while only 9 per cent and 4 per cent monitor indirect (Scope 2) and supply-chain (Scope 3) emissions respectively.

Biofuels emerged as the most widely used or planned alternative fuel at 62 per cent, followed by green hydrogen (25 per cent) and ammonia (19 per cent).

Yet 42 per cent of respondents cited compatibility and infrastructure concerns. New technologies such as onboard carbon capture, wind and solar power, and air lubrication face scepticism over costs, vessel readiness and safety.

For seafarers, the leading safety concern is crew fatigue, identified by 70 per cent of respondents, followed by insufficient training (27 per cent) and limited familiarity with new fuels (26 per cent).

Training gaps remain stark: 64 per cent reported receiving no decarbonisation-related training in the past two years. When training is offered, in-house provision dominates (61 per cent), though external courses are rated more effective.

Skills development is also evolving. Respondents stressed the need for both technical skills—such as emissions monitoring, energy management and handling new fuels, and soft skills, including leadership, teamwork and critical thinking.

Larger fleets, with more than 50 vessels, are considerably more advanced in emissions tracking and ESG strategy adoption, while smaller operators cite resource limitations.

Ports and suppliers reported their own challenges. Only 20 per cent of ports currently offer VLSFO bunkering, despite the Mediterranean’s designation as a SOx Emission Control Area from May 2025. Onshore power systems are the most common planned initiative, yet 40 per cent of ports have no decarbonisation interventions underway.

Meanwhile, 60 per cent lack emissions monitoring systems.

Civil society perceptions are also misaligned with reality. Many citizens believe shipping contributes 50–70 per cent of global GHG emissions, whereas the actual figure is closer to 3 per cent.

At the same time, climate concern is high, with 97 per cent of respondents worried about local environmental impacts and 78 per cent rating shipping decarbonisation as vital for the East Mediterranean’s marine environment.

ST. LOUIS, Mo. (Sept. 29, 2025) — Rural America is under mounting financial pressure as commodity prices for corn and soybeans have fallen 40-50% from recent highs, while production costs remain elevated. A recent National Corn Growers Association survey shows that nearly half of U.S. farmers believe the nation is on the brink of a farm crisis.1 For many, 2025 marks the third consecutive year of negative profitability, threatening both food security and the stability of local economies.

Industry leaders stress that short-term fixes will not be enough. Instead, new and durable demand markets are required to restore profitability for America’s farmers. A potential breakthrough may come this October, when the International Maritime Organization (IMO) is expected to finalize its Net-Zero Framework, requiring large ocean-going vessels to cut greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions beginning in 2027.2

This policy will accelerate demand for biofuels; renewable fuels made from plant material, animal waste, and agricultural residues.3 By 2030, biofuel demand for maritime use could grow by up to 25 million metric tons; one-third of global demand.4

“Biofuels represent more than just cleaner energy. They represent a lifeline for U.S. farmers,” said Ben Kruger, senior vice president, Roeslein Renewables. “By leveraging our agricultural waste and renewable resources, we can stabilize rural communities while helping the shipping industry decarbonize.”

Among the most promising fuels are:

BioLNG: Produced from manure, crop residues, and food waste, BioLNG is compatible with existing LNG infrastructure and can even achieve negative lifecycle emissions. With over 1 billion tons of agricultural waste generated annually, the U.S. is uniquely positioned to lead in BioLNG production.5

Biodiesel: Derived from animal fats, oilseeds, and used cooking oil, biodiesel offers a near drop-in replacement for marine diesel with minimal retrofitting. Increased demand could equal up to twice the size of Iowa’s annual soybean crop, generating new markets for farmers across multiple feedstocks.

Together, BioLNG and biodiesel could help U.S. agriculture supply flexible, scalable, and sustainable fuel solutions for maritime shipping. Projections show these markets could generate $100-200 billion in new farm revenues by 2050, reducing dependence on ad hoc government assistance and strengthening rural economies.

To seize this opportunity, U.S. leadership will be critical. Key actions include:

Coordinating USDA, DOE, EPA, and Treasury programs to support renewable maritime fuels.

Fast-tracking renewable fuel production and blending infrastructure.

Streamlining permitting and credit verification for small and mid-sized farms.

Establishing maritime fuel corridors linking inland feedstock to coastal ports.

“The IMO will reward early movers,” Bryan Sievers, director of government relations, Roeslein Renewables, emphasized. “The U.S. must act now to ensure farmers are not left behind. As the world’s ships sail toward net-zero, it’s time for American agriculture to chart its own course; powered by innovation, infrastructure, and resources we can no longer afford to waste.”

,,2025-09-30T14:35:06Z,SAFETY4SEA,Shipping faces major EU ETS surrender deadline: Key considerations - Safety4Sea,SAFETY4SEA Editor,"”For the here and now, meeting the surrender deadline is key because the risk of non-compliance in surrendering allowances include significant penalties and reputational damage, so effective allowance management is now a core compliance priority for the maritime sector.
While today’s 40% surrender obligation applies to verified 2024 emissions in the form of EU Allowances (EUAs), compliance performance to date has been mixed.
Although the EU ETS formally launched in 2024, fewer than 40% of obligated companies submitted their verified emissions reports by the initial March 2025 deadline.
According to Simone Vitzthum, Assistant Vice President of Loss Prevention and Lawyer at Skuld Club, the UK Authority has reviewed stakeholder feedback and recognised calls to align UK ETS deadlines with those of the EU ETS—particularly the EU allowance surrender deadline of 30 September, rather than the current UK deadline of 30 April.
However, the UK Authority intends to move forward with its proposal to keep the compliance dates aligned with the rest of the UK ETS framework.","With emissions covered by the EU ETS rising to approximately 90 million tonnes in the last 12 months, the phased implementation of this regulation is set to increase financial pressure on shipping operators and potentially driving greater efforts to cut carbon output, Alessio Sbraga, Partner at HFW stressed.

”For the here and now, meeting the surrender deadline is key because the risk of non-compliance in surrendering allowances include significant penalties and reputational damage, so effective allowance management is now a core compliance priority for the maritime sector. Where allowances have not been received from contractual counterparties, effective dispute resolution and recourse actions should also be an important consideration for protecting your position. This applies whether contractual counterparties have managed to agree clauses or amended their contracts or not.”

September 30th is the first compliance deadline for maritime transport, requiring companies to have a strategy for buying, managing, and surrendering the necessary carbon credits, or face financial penalties and operational consequences. The requirement will increase to 70% for 2025 emissions and 100% from 2027 onwards.

Alessio further explains that going forward, the task for shipping operators with a significant vessel carbon footprint is exacerbated due to the regulatory overlap of the EU ETS and the FuelEU Maritime Regulation framework, which came into effect at the start of this year.

With the possible adoption of the IMO Net Zero Framework anticipated in October, this will only add to the trajectory and complexity of the regulatory landscape.

Together, these regulatory developments reflect a significant shift in global maritime policy. For shipowners, operators and stakeholders in the maritime value chain, the challenge lies not just in compliance but in using these changes as a springboard for managing risk, operational efficiency, resilience and innovation.

”Those who act early in the transition to sustainable alternatives will be on the stronger foot in the future of the shipping market and can take advantage of opportunities as they arise.”, Alessio concludes.

While today’s 40% surrender obligation applies to verified 2024 emissions in the form of EU Allowances (EUAs), compliance performance to date has been mixed. Although the EU ETS formally launched in 2024, fewer than 40% of obligated companies submitted their verified emissions reports by the initial March 2025 deadline.

More than half of respondents in the same survey viewed emissions reporting primarily as a compliance burden rather than an opportunity to engage in EUA trading or build a competitive edge. In response, NAPA has urged operators to establish robust EUA procurement strategies.

“Many companies have hired dedicated teams to manage these requirements, while others have outsourced the task,” NAPA stated. “Regardless of the approach, knowing the right time, price, and quantity of EUAs to purchase can deliver significant commercial advantage. Without accurate emissions forecasting, operators risk overpaying, facing price volatility, or failing to comply.”

In addition, the UK Government announced this summer that the UK Emissions Trading Scheme (UK ETS) would be expanded to include maritime transport as part of its Net Zero Strategy. According to Simone Vitzthum, Assistant Vice President of Loss Prevention and Lawyer at Skuld Club, the UK Authority has reviewed stakeholder feedback and recognised calls to align UK ETS deadlines with those of the EU ETS—particularly the EU allowance surrender deadline of 30 September, rather than the current UK deadline of 30 April.

However, the UK Authority intends to move forward with its proposal to keep the compliance dates aligned with the rest of the UK ETS framework. UK emission allowances (UKAs) will remain available for purchase throughout the year via auctions or the secondary market, allowing operators the flexibility to acquire them at any time in preparation for surrender.",https://safety4sea.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/shutterstock_1209734185.jpg,https://safety4sea.com/shipping-faces-major-eu-ets-surrender-deadline/,N,2025-09-30T14:33:29.889140

The new regulations on the IMO NZF in MARPOL Annex VI will be reviewed every five years.","The IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) in April 2025 approved the NZF which will be included as a new Chapter 5 in Annex VI to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL Convention). In addition to the new chapter, the NZF also includes consequential amendments to other regulations in MARPOL Annex VI covering definitions, survey/verification, certificate issuance, port state control, the Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan (SEEMP), as well as the Data Collection System (DCS).

The amendments to MARPOL were approved by a majority vote and are due for adoption at an extraordinary session of the MEPC in October 2025. Adoption requires a two-thirds majority of parties to MARPOL Annex VI present and voting. While the amendments are expected to enter into force in March 2027, in practice the new requirements will apply to ships from 1 January 2028.

The NZF is the IMO’s regulatory response to the 2023 IMO GHG Strategy, which sets out the ambition to reach net-zero GHG emissions by or around 2050. The stated goal of the NZF is to ensure that international shipping can meet the strategy’s GHG emission reduction targets, to accelerate the uptake of so-called zero or near-zero GHG fuels, technologies and energy sources (ZNZs), as well as to support a just and equitable transition of the maritime sector.

The regulations provide a long-term trajectory to 2040 for the GHG emissions through setting GHG intensity reduction requirements for ships. The GHG fuel intensity (GFI) is a technology-neutral metric measured as well-to-wake GHG emissions per energy used on board a ship, supplemented by sustainability criteria. Several features in the NZF are similar to those in FuelEU Maritime, but there are important differences.

The NZF is ground-breaking in introducing a global technical requirement in combination with a GHG pricing scheme. It presents a new regulatory era where ships will be required to gradually adopt fuels that are considerably more expensive than conventional fossil fuels, or alternatively pay a contribution to the IMO Net-Zero Fund. Given the long lifespan of ships, shipowners should prepare now for the new regulations to ensure cost-effective compliance, both at the ship and the fleet levels.

Scope and metric

The new regulations apply to all ships above 5,000 gross tonnes (GT). They do not apply to ships trading solely domestically, to platforms including floating production, storage and offloading units (FPSOs), floating storage units (FSUs) and drilling rigs, or to semi-submersible vessels. As for other IMO requirements, it is the manager – in other words, the ISM company – which is responsible for compliance for the ship towards the flag. In case of change of company, it is the company at the end of each calendar year which is responsible for the full 12-month reporting period. The GFI metric also includes electricity delivered to the ship, as well as wind propulsion and solar power. The attained GFI is to be reported annually by the ship as part of the DCS.

The reporting of the GFI will be enabled by expanding the current DCS scheme. Each ship will be required to develop or update its data collection and reporting plan to include the necessary elements to calculate the GHG intensity. The plan must be verified and kept on board together with a Confirmation of Compliance prior to the start of the first reporting period, which is 1 January 2028. The regulations mandate that the GHG emissions factors and sustainability aspects should be certified by a recognized Sustainable Fuels Certification Scheme (SFCS). SFCSs are to be approved by the MEPC, and the IMO will publish a list of recognized SFCSs by 1 March 2027. This list will be periodically updated. The GHG emissions factors and information on sustainability aspects should be provided on the Fuel Lifecycle Label (FLL) and accompany the Bunker Delivery Note when the fuel is delivered. Details on these aspects will be included in guidelines to be developed in the coming years.

Requirements

Two tiers of requirements are set on the annual attained GFI for a ship: a Base target and a Direct Compliance target. Each ship is required to meet the Direct Compliance target, either through the use of low-GHG fuels, or through one of the alternative compliance approaches described later in this chapter. The Base target is used to separate between Tier 1 and Tier 2 compliance deficits. The regulations include annual GFI reduction targets to 2035, as shown in Figure 3-2. A Base target for 2040 is also included and set to 65%. The annual reduction targets for the years 2036 to 2040 are expected to be set as part of the first review by 1 January 2032.

Compliance approaches

Based on the attained GFI and the targets, each ship will have to determine an annual compliance balance, expressed in tonnes CO2eq. If a ship has a GFI lower than the Direct Compliance target, it will receive surplus units (SUs). Conversely, if a ship has a GFI above the Direct Compliance target, it has a negative compliance balance and accrues compliance deficits:

For an attained GFI between the Base and the Direct Compliance targets, a ship generates a Tier 1 compliance deficit.

For an attained GFI above the Base target, a ship generates both a Tier 1 compliance deficit (for the emissions between the Base and the Direct Compliance targets) and a Tier 2 compliance deficit (for the emissions above the Base target).

To handle compliance deficits and surpluses, the NZF includes several compliance approaches as illustrated in Figure 3-3 below. A ship with a compliance surplus can transfer SUs to other vessels – including to ships under other companies – which have a compliance deficit (similar to FuelEU Maritime’s concept of compliance pooling). The ship with a compliance surplus can also bank SUs for later use within the two subsequent calendar years, or it can cancel the SUs as a voluntary mitigation contribution (which prevents the SU being used to balance a deficit for another ship). Note that an SU can only be transferred once and can only be transferred to balance a Tier 2 compliance deficit. This avoids accumulation of SUs for later trading.

A ship can balance its Tier 2 compliance deficit with SUs from other ships, banked SUs from the previous reporting period, or it can buy remedial units (RUs) from the IMO Net-Zero Fund. The Tier 1 compliance deficit can only be compensated by Tier 1 RUs – in other words, SUs from other ships cannot be used to balance Tier 1 compliance deficit. The initial RU prices for the reporting periods 2028 to 2030 are set as follows:

Tier 1 RU: 100 USD per tonne of CO2eq

Tier 2 RU: 380 USD per tonne of CO2eq

The MEPC will determine a mechanism by 1 January 2028 for reviewing and defining RU prices for 2031 and onwards. The regulations are designed in this manner with the intention that most ships will use sufficient low-GHG emission fuels to reach the Base target and then buy Tier 1 RUs. This requires that the IMO sets the Tier 2 RU price higher than the price for low-GHG emission fuels. Alternatively, ships can buy SUs from other ships to cover the Tier 2 compliance deficit down to Base target and then acquire Tier 1 RUs down to Direct Compliance target. This ensures that a certain amount of revenue is generated for disbursement purposes, while ensuring that the fleet achieves at least the Base target.

IMO Net-Zero Fund and rewards for using ZNZs

The proceeds from the sale of RUs, estimated to 10 to 15 BUSD/year, will go into the IMO Net-Zero Fund, to be set up and managed by the IMO. No revenues will be paid to IMO member states; the proceeds will all go directly from the shipping company into the Fund. Part of the revenues are intended to be used for rewards for ships that use zero or near-zero GHG emission technologies, fuels and/or energy sources (ZNZs). This reward for use of ZNZs, and the methodology for determining the reward, will be defined by 1 March 2027, and will be reviewed every five years starting in 2032. The NZF defines ZNZs as technologies, fuels and energy sources with a GFI below 19 gCO2eq/MJ until end 2034, and 14 gCO2eq/MJ from 2035 onwards. Further details will be specified in new guidelines, and the IMO may approve additional specific ZNZs, making them eligible for rewards even if they do not fulfil the GFI threshold.

The remaining revenues will go to other purposes, focused on promoting a just and equitable transition in states by facilitating environmental and climate protection, adaptation and resilience building. This can include researching, developing and making globally available and deploying ZNZs; enabling a just transition for seafarers and other maritime workforce; facilitating information-sharing, technology transfer, capacity-building, training and technical cooperation; implementation of national action plans; and addressing disproportionately negative impacts, including on food security.

IMO GFI Registry

The IMO will set up a registry which is responsible for handling the GHG emission reports, transfer of SUs, and sale of RUs. Transfer and trading of SUs and purchasing of RUs will commence in 2029 based on the GFI reported by ships for 2028. Each ship in scope of these regulations needs to have an account with the IMO GFI Registry by 1 October 2027 and must pay an annual administration fee to the GFI Registry by 30 June every year starting in 2028. The administration fee is an additional payment to cover the registry’s administrative cost and will be set in new guidelines.

Remaining work

While the legal framework of the NZF is in place with the approved amendments to MARPOL Annex VI, a large amount of work remains to develop the necessary guidelines before entry into force. This includes guidelines to make the GFI Registry and Net-Zero Fund – central features of the framework – fully operational no later than the end of the first reporting period in 2028. Many of the remaining details of the NZF will also be determined in guidelines, including the following issues:

Detailed method for calculation of GFI, including for wind propulsion and electricity. The legal text in MARPOL provides an overall formula for calculating GFI, but the detailed calculation method is yet to be decided in a new guideline. This includes how wind propulsion and electricity should be taken into account.

Default emission factors. The existing IMO Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) Guidelines are a critical part of the NZF and will need to be further developed to support implementation. This includes the development of default emission factors for fossil LNG. The LCA Guidelines are expected to remain under continuous review for the foreseeable future.

Certification of fuels. The NZF mandates that the GHG emission factors and sustainability aspects of fuels delivered to a ship are to be certified by a recognized Sustainable Fuels Certification Scheme (SFCS), though the details on how to do this are to be decided in guidelines. These include guidelines on requirements and procedures for recognition of certification schemes/standards. This is a central part of the NZF, as robust certification is critical to ensure trust in the calculation of ship’s attained GFI and compliance balance.

Reward for use of ZNZs. Ships that use ZNZs may receive an annual compensation from the Net-Zero Fund. However, the type and level of reward are yet to be decided in guidelines. The reward and the methodology for determining the reward will be defined by 1 March 2027, when the NZF enters into force. The reward will then be reviewed every five years starting in 2032 based on a study by the IMO Secretariat on use of ZNZs. The percentage of the Net-Zero Fund that will be allocated to rewards will be decided in the Fund’s governing provisions, and this will be reviewed periodically.

Mechanism for determining the RU prices. The NZF has set initial RU prices from 2028 to 2030, and the IMO will by 1 January 2028 determine the mechanism for reviewing and defining RU prices from 2031 onwards. The Tier 2 RU price is important as it sets an upper ceiling for a competitive price of low-GHG and ZNZ fuels, while the RU Tier 1 price determines the main part of the revenue for the IMO Net-Zero Fund. The Tier 1 RU price is expected to be set lower than the alternative cost of low-GHG and ZNZ fuels in order to be the preferred compliance approach, while the Tier 2 RU price will be set higher than the alternative cost in order to ensure that GHG emission reduction is the most feasible solution. To achieve this, the RU price-setting mechanism needs to take into account the price of available low-GHG fuels, and the RU prices may increase in the future.

The new regulations on the IMO NZF in MARPOL Annex VI will be reviewed every five years. The review will consider potential amendment of the annual GFI reduction factors, amendment of the ZNZ threshold values, and the possible inclusion of ships down to 400 GT.",https://safety4sea.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/green-fuels-photo-scaled-e1649141683560.jpg,https://safety4sea.com/dnv-overview-of-imos-net-zero-framework/,N,2025-09-30T14:33:37.800622

This natural complementarity reduces intermittency and enables cost-effective, large-scale production of green fuels.
For shipping, this means green fuels can reach the market more quickly and expand in line with demand.
Among the potential fuels, green ammonia stands out as one of the most viable options for deep-sea shipping.","The shipping industry stands at a decisive moment. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has already committed to reaching net-zero emissions by or around 2050, with interim targets for 2030 and 2040. These milestones demand rapid transformation of a sector that currently contributes almost three percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. The upcoming vote at the IMO in October will determine whether the industry gains the clear framework it needs to accelerate its energy transition, or whether uncertainty continues to slow progress.

Pilot projects and small-scale demonstrations have played a useful role in testing new technologies, but they cannot deliver the volumes of affordable green fuels required to decarbonize the global fleet. Only giga-scale projects can provide the speed, cost reductions and reliability needed to meet the IMO’s ambitious goals. At InterContinental Energy, we see mega-projects, supported by predictable regulation and industry-wide partnerships, as the only credible path to define the next chapter of maritime decarbonization.

The Case for Scale

The shipping sector requires an entirely new fuel system at a global level. Unlike other industries that can decarbonize incrementally, maritime must transition to fuels that can power vessels across international waters, be available in every port, and be produced competitively enough to rival fossil fuels. This transformation cannot be achieved through scattered initiatives.

Giga-scale renewable energy hubs provide a credible pathway. Projects like InterContinental Energy’s Western Green Energy Hub (WGEH) in Western Australia demonstrate what is possible. At full build-out, WGEH will produce up to 28 million tonnes of green ammonia per year, enough to displace a significant proportion of today’s marine fuel demand. Even its first phase, expected in the early 2030s, will deliver two million tonnes annually. By then, production costs are expected to fall below $650 per tonne, making green ammonia competitive with fossil-derived fuels - but only if the right regulatory framework is in place to unlock demand and investment.

The economics hinge on size. Like the oil and gas industry, large renewable projects can tap resource basins to maximize efficiency. InterContinental Energy’s project locations in coastal deserts combine world-class wind and solar profiles, with windy nights and sunny days creating a near-continuous energy supply for hydrogen electrolyzers. This natural complementarity reduces intermittency and enables cost-effective, large-scale production of green fuels. For shipping, this means green fuels can reach the market more quickly and expand in line with demand.

Among the potential fuels, green ammonia stands out as one of the most viable options for deep-sea shipping. While its volumetric energy density is lower than conventional marine fuels, it is relatively straightforward to store and transport at scale. Crucially, ammonia can be produced directly from renewable hydrogen, meaning both fuels are part of the same value chain. It is energy-rich enough to power long-haul voyages, scalable from abundant renewable resources, and avoids the land-use and food security concerns associated with biofuels. Momentum is already building, with ammonia-ready vessels entering the global fleet and ports beginning to plan bunkering facilities.

Building the Ecosystem

Fuel producers alone cannot deliver maritime decarbonization. Ports, shipbuilders, engine manufacturers, financial institutions and training providers must all evolve in parallel. Infrastructure for bunkering and handling new fuels needs to be developed. Shipyards must deliver dual-fuel and ammonia-ready engines. Investors must provide capital through long-term contracts. Seafarers must be trained to handle alternative fuels safely.

Encouraging signs of collaboration are emerging. Some shipping companies are committing to offtake agreements, a vital step in enabling mega-projects to reach final investment decision (FID). Ports across Europe, the Middle East and Asia are mapping future fuel requirements, and classification societies are establishing safety standards for ammonia handling. Yet more must be done. Without stronger demand signals from the shipping sector, companies risk missing the opportunity to secure competitively priced green fuels, leaving other industries to move ahead.

Timing is also critical. Infrastructure must be available when shipping needs it, not years later. That means building ahead of demand. InterContinental Energy’s projects are already progressing through environmental approvals, with phased development designed to align with the IMO’s milestones. If the industry waits until demand is guaranteed, it will be too late to meet the 2030 and 2040 targets. Forward planning is essential, even when the commercial case is not yet fully visible.

Regulatory Certainty as the Catalyst

The decisive factor in unlocking this transformation is regulatory certainty. Shipping is a global industry that relies on clear and enforceable international rules. For decades, the IMO has provided the level playing field necessary for trade. It must now provide the same clarity for decarbonization.

Earlier this year, the IMO adopted a revised strategy at MEPC 83, but the vote on mid-term measures in October will be decisive. This package, which could include fuel standards and carbon pricing mechanisms, has the potential to unlock investment across the sector. A robust framework will give shipowners, ports and fuel producers the confidence to commit to the large-scale infrastructure required. Without it, uncertainty will delay capital flows, slow down deployment and risk derailing progress toward net zero.

With regulatory clarity, however, the industry can move decisively. Developers can advance giga-projects, investors can commit capital, and shipowners can plan vessel renewals knowing that alternative fuels will be available at competitive prices. The October vote is not simply a policy milestone; it is the catalyst for the entire ecosystem to accelerate.

A Call to Action

The shipping industry has no margin for delay. Giga-scale, modular renewable projects can deliver affordable fuels at scale. Partnerships across the ecosystem can align supply and demand. Regulatory clarity from the IMO can unlock the confidence needed to act with speed and conviction.

Maritime leaders now face a responsibility and an opportunity. They must support the IMO’s vote in October, advocate for ambitious regulatory measures, and commit to offtake agreements that will bring giga-projects from vision to reality. They must also champion collaboration across the value chain, ensuring that ships, ports, fuels and finance evolve together.

The future of shipping will not be defined by incremental improvements but by decisive choices. Scale, certainty and collective action are the keys to success. The time to act is now, and the industry must seize this moment to lead the global energy transition.
