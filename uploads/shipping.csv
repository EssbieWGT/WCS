We’re living in a fragmented, multipolar world.","A fragmented, multipolar approach to decarbonization might actually fit our fragmented, multipolar world better.

By James Lightbourn — While there’s plenty of soul-searching underway among supporters of the world’s first proposed carbon tax, its one-year delay could ultimately lead to a more resilient decarbonization framework — and perhaps an acknowledgment that the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and, in turn, the United Nations (U.N.), might not be the right body to oversee such a measure.

To understand what happened, and where we go from here, we need to understand the rationale behind the American-led rebellion against the Net Zero Framework (NZF).

The reason behind the NZF outcome is simple: “money”.

U.S. messaging around its opposition to the NZF focused on the potential cost to American consumers. But that argument rang hollow — especially since recently announced U.S. tariffs and fees on Chinese-built ships will likely have a similar effect.

However, the U.S.’ more compelling oppositional argument runs deeper and reflects waning confidence in the U.N. Even though it is headquartered in New York, only 32% of Americans believe it does a good job. Those figures are even worse amongst Republicans, 70% of whom believe the U.S. should decrease its funding of the U.N.

This is where the paradox starts to emerge.

The U.N. has an annual operating budget of $3.7 billion. The U.S. is the largest contributor to the U.N. and was assessed to be responsible for 22% of the regular budget, or $820 million in 2025. The Trump administration’s 2026 budget request seeks to withhold that contribution entirely.

The IMO, through the Net Zero Framework, is estimated to raise as much as $10 billion a year through carbon levies on the global shipping industry.

There would, no doubt, be tensions between a cash-strapped parent organization – the U.N. – and a cash-rich subsidiary – the IMO. This raises legitimate questions as to whether financial pressures could arise to such a level that IMO will feel compelled to divert funds collected under the NZF to cover shortfalls in the U.N. ‘s operating budget.

The U.N.’s financial situation (and the U.S.’ reluctance to fund it) aside, there was also the thorny question as to how the IMO would prudently allocate funds to support the decarbonization of the shipping sector without being heavy-handed in picking winners and losers amongst shipowners and fuel technologies.

With the NZF vote delayed, what is going to happen next?

NZF supporters often argue that a global industry needs global regulation, and that without it we’ll face a patchwork of regional rules.

But is that really such a bad outcome?

The European Union — one of the NZF’s biggest proponents — has already gone its own way, adding shipping to the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) and launching FuelEU Maritime. Brussels said that it would revisit those programs if the NZF passed, but never said exactly how. With the global plan now on hold, the EU framework remains intact. Similarly, African nations, led by Djibouti, have launched the African Sovereign Carbon Registry to collect fees from shipping companies based on their greenhouse gas emissions while calling their ports.

Other nations and regions are likely to follow suit. Yes, compliance will get more complex — but shipping companies already navigate a web of local regulations every time they arrive in port. Adding emissions requirements to that list won’t grind global trade to a halt.

Localized frameworks also ensure that the funds collected stay closer to the people and places most affected. Governments can decide how carbon revenues influence their own economies, export competitiveness, and consumer prices. And they can move faster — without waiting for consensus from 175 IMO member states.

We’re living in a fragmented, multipolar world. A fragmented, multipolar approach to decarbonization might actually fit it better.

Relying on a global institution struggling with governance, enforcement, and credibility might never have been a winning strategy.

A fragmented landscape of regional frameworks — from the EU’s ETS to whatever U.S., Asian, or Middle Eastern mechanisms emerge next — may actually prove more effective. Fragmentation allows nations to tailor policies to their own economic interests, move faster, and direct revenues toward local decarbonization rather than funneling billions into a centralized U.N. fund with limited oversight.

A decentralized, market-driven race to decarbonize — grounded in competition, instead of consensus — may be the most realistic solution in today’s geopolitical environment and, in turn, do more for the planet than a one-size-fits-all U.N. framework ever could hope to achieve.",https://gcaptain.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/shutterstock_142906477.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 16:16:27.468622

Some participants are feeling relief while many were disappointed and pointed to the near-term uncertainties that everyone hoped would have been resolved.

The working group, however, is going ahead to continue work on the guidelines for implementing the Net Zero Framework. They will be focusing on key issues related to greenhouse gas emissions as it works to develop consensus and clarifications on the architecture and implementation as well as the planned global fund. Further negotiations are expected on the carbon revenues as well as elements such as the use of biofuels and the supply of alternative fuels.

“The Framework’s success was always dependent on the development of strong and coherent implementation guidelines,” said Dr. Alison Shaw, IMO Policy Manager at the influential NGO T&E (European Federation for Transport and Environment). “This work can continue regardless of the delay.”

Jan Hoffmann, the Global Lead for Maritime Transport and Ports at the World Bank wrote in a social media posting that the delays were “sad news” and “a sad day for multilateralism.” He warned that it “extends uncertainty for the maritime industry, leading to delays in investments in ports and shipping capacity, which will ultimately also mean higher and more volatile freight rates.”

Some parts, however, also expressed their frustration and anger at the members and the IMO. The Ambassador of the Republic of the Marshall Islands who is the Marshall Islands Special Envoy for Maritime Decarbonization, Albon Ishoda, wrote, “Don’t pretend that the Pacific was voiceless; we were ignored, bullied, threatened, cornered, sidelined and harassed…. A year delay is a year of more devastation and displacement for our communities that have nothing to do with this catastrophe. We don’t have the luxury of time. The IMO owe our people an explanation!”

The industry has begun to comprehend the delay while still standing behind the IMO. “Global regulation is essential to ensure a level playing field at international level and to deliver the energy transition of international shipping. We will continue to work with our international partners to ensure an agreement on the IMO NZF can be reached,” said Sotiris Raptis, Secretary General of European Shipowners (ECSA).

The World Shipping Council also asserted that the IMO remains the right place to deliver a global solution. It wrote on Friday after the vote that it is committed to continuing to work with the government to deliver the necessary regulatory consistent for the industry.

The World Shipping Council is urging the IMO to use the time to close the remaining gaps in the agreement. INTERCARGO also reaffirmed its support for the IMO as the sole global regulator capable of delivering coherent and effective measures for international shipping. Similarly, the International Transport Workers’ Federation issue a statement calling for the governments to use the time to rebuild trust and reach agreement on a fair and practical path to decarbonizing shipping.

Many shipping companies have already said they will stay the course with their current efforts, while some owners of older ships are feeling a sense of temporary relief.",https://maritime-executive.com/media/images/article/IMO-MPEC-Session-Oct-2025.9ac2d9.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 14:56:08.258853
,,2025-10-20 17:21:32+00:00,Ship Technology,Industry reaction as IMO's Net Zero Framework adoption pushed back another year,Patrick Rhys Atack,,,,,https://www.ship-technology.com/news/imos-net-zero-strategy-adoption-pushed-back-another-year-by-saudi-vote/,"It was supposed to be a final, and relatively easy, stage of the International Maritime Organisation’s Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) process to commit the global shipping industry to its Net Zero Framework.
As an industry we will continue to work with the IMO, which is the best organisation to deliver the global regulations needed for a global industry,” he said.
There’s never been a sensible global emissions policy that helps the industry transition to sustainable practices,” she said.
In times of geopolitical uncertainty, today’s decision could have sent a strong signal for global climate protection and multilateralism.
But this week has also shown that there is a clear desire to clean up the shipping industry, even in the face of US bullying.","It was supposed to be a final, and relatively easy, stage of the International Maritime Organisation’s Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) process to commit the global shipping industry to its Net Zero Framework. The hard battle had been fought in April at MEPC83, when the NZF and “mid term greenhouse gas reduction measures” were negotiated and agreed upon. But the steady ship began to list when the White House made a statement on Friday 10 October decrying unfair “burdens” on shipping and the “American people”. It described the NZF as an “unsanctioned global tax regime,” despite the UN body’s membership passing the measures via its usual process.

The EU issued a statement following the White House’s intervention, which reiterated the bloc’s support for the deal and suggested it should be adopted, and the IMO Secretary General Arsenio Dominguez called for continued good-faith diplomacy and said the “process has been inclusive and thorough.”

As the week progressed, some reports from the IMO’s London Headquarters suggested on one hand that despite some opposition, with the US now joined by Russia and Saudi Arabia, the majority support meant spirits were high and compromise, and NZF adoption, was the likely outcome. Other reports gave a more mixed picture, and suggested the adoption of the agreed Framework would not be straightforward at all.

But on the final day the Extraordinary Session came down to a vote proposed by the Saudi delegation to adjourn the meeting for a full year. The vote passed, and delegates will “continue to work towards consensus on the IMO Net Zero Framework” in 12 months time. However, the IMO said its “Intersessional Working Group on the Reduction on Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Ships, scheduled to meet 20 to 24 October 2025, will go ahead to continue work on the guidelines for implementing the Net Zero Framework.”

57 delegations voted for the year-long adjournment, 49 voted to oppose it, and 21 abstained.

IMO Members and stakeholder reactions

The response from many actors in the global shipping industry has been negative, but due to the political nature of the IMO and its discussions, very few shipping lines or vessel owners have publicly stated their views on the delay.

The IMO’s Dominguez was clearly unhappy with the highly politicised debate, and said “It is the time to really look back at how we have approached this meeting. My plea to you is not to repeat the way we have approached this meeting for future discussions.”

Thomas A. Kazakos, International Chamber of Shipping Secretary General, made clear that what the sector needed was clarity on future regulations and therefore the delay would not help the wider shipping industry.

“We are disappointed that member states have not been able to agree a way forward at this meeting. Industry needs clarity to be able to make the investments needed to decarbonise the maritime sector, in line with the goals set out in the IMO GHG strategy. As an industry we will continue to work with the IMO, which is the best organisation to deliver the global regulations needed for a global industry,” he said.

Kostas Gkonis, Secretary General of INTERCARGO shared one of the more positive reactions, saying the delay was “an opportunity for further dialogue” and restating the association of dry bulk ship owners’ commitment to the IMO. This was a heavy hint that INTERCARGO does not want to see the fracturing of regional regulations that some are worried may follow the adjournment.

“Following IMO’s decision regarding the Net Zero Framework, INTERCARGO reaffirms its support to the IMO as the sole global regulator capable of delivering coherent and effective measures for international shipping. We wish to see the current postponement as an opportunity for further dialogue. The time ahead should be used constructively and effectively to bridge differing positions among IMO Member States and to also ensure that the industry’s voice and input are heard and taken onboard.

“We invite Member States at IMO to work more closely among them but also in partnership with the shipping community towards agreeing on a regulatory framework that is realistic, practical, and globally workable,” Gkonis concluded.

One of the firms that has shared a view on the collapse of the Extraordinary Session was OceanScore, which has delveoped a suite of tools to help shipping operators comply with emissions regulatuons like FuelEU.

In OceanScore’s view the vote to delay the NZF adoption “marks a turning point for shipping.”

“The vote wasn’t just procedural; it undermines the MEPC’s role and multilateral climate action as a whole. A one-year delay won’t change the political blockers.

With no clear global path forward, rules are now moving in different directions. Planning fuel, engine, and efficiency investments just became riskier and more expensive.”

“Regional rules will surge: the UK may extend its ETS to international voyages, and others could follow. With FuelEU Maritime now locked in, shipowners must hard-wire C/P and SHIPMAN clauses — waiting time is up,” it added.

Unsurprisingly, the most vocal group reacting to the delay have been companies engaged in cutting shipping emissions, and environmental groups.

Smart Green Shipping’s CEO Diane Gilpin said it was no surprise, and the lack of a centralised plan to cut the industry’s carbon output is a continunation, not a change. “While the decision by the International Maritime Organization’s Marine Environment Protection Committee (IMO MEPC83) to postpone adoption of the IMO Net Zero Framework by one year is disappointing it’s not surprising. There’s never been a sensible global emissions policy that helps the industry transition to sustainable practices,” she said.

Others, including Delaine McCullough, Ocean Conservancy’s shipping program director, had stronger criticisms for delegates.

“The failure of IMO member states to clinch this agreement is a major setback for people and the planet. It’s disgraceful that climate action has been delayed when we see the devastating impacts every day, and when shipping fuels have been tied to 250,000 premature deaths and 6 million cases of childhood asthma every year.

“The agreement would have required ships across the globe to slash their greenhouse gas emissions, driving a sector-wide switch from dirty fossil fuels to zero-emission options, including harnessing the power of wind to traverse the ocean and running on new fuels produced from 100% renewable energy. The agreement would have slashed carbon emissions and saved lives. A world without this agreement is dirtier and more dangerous for people, wildlife and the ocean.”

However, McCullough pointed to future IMO actions that could assist climate efforts. “While the agreement was not perfect, it was an important step to deliver on the IMO’s commitment and send clear signals to an industry that was not only asking for a global framework, but actively supported this deal. While this delay is a serious setback, there is still a major opportunity to put the sector on a zero-emission pathway. In April 2026, the IMO will continue the revision of its main energy efficiency measure, the Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII), which would reduce fuel burn through technical and operational measures like simply slowing ships down. Strengthening the CII is absolutely critical to immediate emission reductions, necessary to meet the IMO’s 2030 goals.”

Lukas Leppert of German-based The Nature and Biodiversity Conservation Union (NABU), a Maritime Beyond Methane (MARBEM) partner, highlighted the economic losses from the delay alongside the environmental price.

“The outcome of today is disappointing. The international community has a clear obligation to protect the climate in shipping. In times of geopolitical uncertainty, today’s decision could have sent a strong signal for global climate protection and multilateralism. Instead, delays and obstacles have jeopardized more than a decade of negotiations.

“A package of measures to gradually replace fossil fuels and technologies, like LNG, and to relieve the burden on the climate and the environment was on the table. The path of delaying will lead to significantly higher economic costs and climate damages that will extend far beyond the shipping sector and into future generations.”

European presure group Transport & Environment accused the US of “bullying” over climate action, and lauded the European Union for continuing its efforts.

Alison Shaw, IMO Manager at T&E, said: “The delay leaves the shipping sector drifting in uncertainty. But this week has also shown that there is a clear desire to clean up the shipping industry, even in the face of US bullying. The world cannot let intimidation and vested interests dictate the pace of climate action. Climate-ambitious countries must use this moment to build a strong majority in support of meaningful decarbonisation. They will be the ones that benefit from the economy of tomorrow, not the geopolitical power games of the past.”

T&E’s general statement added: “Crucially, the EU must continue to strengthen its own green shipping ambitions and retain its own maritime policies which now stand as the only substantive regulations to tackle shipping emissions in the void left by the IMO NZF. Bold regional action is still possible with or without the US.”

Finally, in a statement on LinkedIn, Secretary General of Zero Emissions Ship Technology Association Madadh MacLaine hoped that compromise would win out, in spite of “divisive actions”.

“MEPC ES2 adjourned abruptly after a vote called by Saudi Arabia, who continually referred to the IMO as a ‘House Divided’. For us who have been participating in the process since pre GHG Strategy, this house was only divided by the divisive actions of one bad actor (not named here) giving power to the latent negativity that we have overcome through delicate negotiations for years,” she said.

“Peace is not a passive state. It is a balance of constant dialogue and compromise. For the first time in my experience here, certain parties refused to move their position, continuously seeking to undermine the process,” MacLaine opined.",https://www.ship-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2025/10/GettyImages-2240442062-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 14:00:02.452935

By addressing these critical issues, the IMO can develop a more effective and equitable NZF, ultimately supporting the global shipping industry's transition to a low-carbon future.
Under the NZF, vessels that meet the direct target may generate Surplus Units (SUs), while non-compliant vessels will generate Remedial Units (RUs).
Non-compliant vessels may offset their Tier II Remedial Units by acquiring Surplus Units from compliant vessels.
This supply-demand imbalance will likely drive SU trading prices close to the Tier II penalty threshold.","The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has decided to postpone the adoption of its Net-Zero Framework (NZF) for another year. This delay, while creating additional uncertainty, warrant careful examination of the proposed mechanisms. Prior to the IMO MEPC meeting, in-depth research by Rystad Energy 's maritime decarbonization specialists revealed critical gaps in the current NZF that would to be addressed to ensure an equitable and sustainable transition for the global shipping industry. The delay will now give member states time to refine ambiguous or contentious elements to produce a stronger, more implementable framework.

The research revealed a substantial disparity between projected clean-fuel availability and targeted demand, exacerbated by infrastructure constraints, which raises concerns about the feasibility of the prescribed transition timeline. Furthermore, the study exposed a persistent imbalance in the carbon-trading mechanism, with demand for Tier II remedial unit offsets expected to outstrip available surplus units through 2035. This structural deficit is anticipated to drive trading prices towards the Tier II penalty ceiling.

The research also underscores the need for careful consideration in designing the reward mechanism to prevent it from becoming a mere penalty-collection system. While the cost gap is expected to narrow as technology matures and economies of scale are achieved, a well-designed reward mechanism is crucial to incentivize sustainable practices. By addressing these critical issues, the IMO can develop a more effective and equitable NZF, ultimately supporting the global shipping industry's transition to a low-carbon future.

Decarbonizing the maritime sector is a complex challenge that goes beyond shipping, closely tied to the global shift from fossil fuels to renewables. Our findings suggests progress will likely lag behind the IMO’s current expectations due to infrastructure limits, technology readiness, and energy system interconnections. While the industry is committed, practical constraints demand a realistic approach. The IMO should use the extra year to refine the NZF into a more practical and equitable framework.

For more on the future of green shipping, listen to the recent Let’s Talk Energy episode: Shipping has a plan to go green, but will it work?

Rystad Energy recently published a detailed investigation into the NZF and its financial implications for the shipping industry's decarbonization journey. Download the report here.

The analysis leveraged our extensive cross-sector data assets, from conventional fuels to hydrogen derivatives and biofuels, alongside a comprehensive analysis of alternative-fuel fleet composition, port infrastructure and global shipyard capabilities.

Under the NZF, vessels that meet the direct target may generate Surplus Units (SUs), while non-compliant vessels will generate Remedial Units (RUs). Remedial Units are categorized in two tiers: Tier I (RU1s) for vessels that meet the base target, and Tier II (RU2s) for those that do not.

Non-compliant vessels may offset their Tier II Remedial Units by acquiring Surplus Units from compliant vessels.

Key findings from Rystad Energy’s research reveal a complex interplay between SUs and RUs within the framework. Initial projections show SUs starting at 40 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent in 2028, growing to 53 million tonnes by 2035. Simultaneously, RU2s are expected to increase significantly from 47 million tonnes to 234 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent annually by 2035. The availability ratio between the SUs and RU2s will effectively set the market-clearing price for exchanges, with Rystad Energy’s projections suggesting that demand for RU2 offsets will consistently outstrip SU supply until 2035. This supply-demand imbalance will likely drive SU trading prices close to the Tier II penalty threshold.

Our analysis indicates that the trading price of surplus units will likely be governed by market dynamics rather than biofuel cost premiums. Given the limited availability of advanced biofuels for shipping, we anticipate that SU prices will approach the Tier II penalty level of $380 per tonne of CO2 equivalent, minus transaction costs.

Junlin Yu, vice president of supply chain research, Rystad Energy

While surplus units will substantially offset Tier II penalties through 2030, this mechanism could inadvertently limit the financial incentives available for early adopters of zero-emission technologies. The real turning point comes in 2031, when surplus units become increasingly scarce, compliance requirements tighten, and shipping companies face growing emission deficits. This will trigger a sharp escalation in penalty collections, substantially boosting the Net-Zero Fund's capacity to support the industry's decarbonization efforts.

The research highlights potential challenges in the framework's design, particularly the two-year limit on banking surplus units to avoid dilution of future emission-reduction efforts, which could potentially dampen early adoption of clean technologies. This constraint stands in stark contrast to the FuelEU Maritime regulation's permanent banking allowance.

Financial projections indicate substantial growth in the IMO Net-Zero Fund, with combined Tier I and Tier II penalties expected to generate approximately $13 billion in 2028, escalating to nearly $79 billion by 2035. However, our analysis raises concerns about the framework's effectiveness in supporting the transition to zero-emission vessels, particularly in its early years.

Rystad Energy's analysis estimates the potential reward level and benchmarks it against the required reward level, which is the threshold necessary to equalize the effective costs of e-fuels and conventional fuel oil. Initially, the required reward level is substantial due to the significant cost premium associated with e-fuels, resulting in a shortfall in cost compensation from the net-zero fund until 2030, even if 100% of the fund's resources are allocated to rewards. However, as technological advancements drive cost reductions, learning effects take hold, and economies of scale are achieved, the required reward level is expected to decrease over time, ultimately yielding a substantial surplus in the fund after the required reward.

Our findings suggest that even with 100% fund allocation toward rewards, the mechanism may not adequately compensate for the cost premium of zero or near-zero emission fuels (ZNZs) until 2030. However, beyond 2030, a substantial surplus is expected to emerge in the fund, driven by the initially low uptake of ZNZs. This underscores the critical importance of carefully designing the reward mechanism to ensure it effectively catalyzes the industry's transition toward zero-emission shipping. The fund should be used to drive meaningful emissions reductions, rather than accumulating a large surplus.

—

If an environmental economist stumbled upon a magic lamp and got one wish from the genie, most of us would know what to ask for—a harmonized global price on greenhouse gas emissions pegged to the social cost of carbon. Economists are usually told that such a carbon price is magical thinking, that it can never be adopted in the real world.

So I was fascinated and heartened when the International Maritime Organization voted in April to put a global price on carbon in the shipping industry. The IMO is a UN agency that governs global shipping, including provisions covering safety and the environment, through a treaty process. In 2023, the IMO adopted a framework for global shipping that had a 2050 net zero target. The vote in April, which occurred only after the US stormed out of the meetings, approved a substantial emissions fee as a mechanism for achieving these goals, with the revenue used both to help shippers decarbonize and to help the most vulnerable island nations adapt. Standard IMO procedure mandates a waiting period before finalization, which brought the April action back to the IMO’s meetings last week in London.

The April decision was a landmark. Shipping accounts for around 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions—about the same as Germany. The April policy called for substantial fees that would create a binding price across the globe, covering vessels over a certain size, which constitute 85% of shipping. The policy had broad support internationally (including the EU27, China, Brazil, the UK, Canada, Korea and Japan) and from industry—shippers themselves were asking for regulatory guidance before investing in the next generation of vessels.

In broad strokes, this sounds like the economist’s dream come true. Upon closer inspection, however, the policy isn’t quite a carbon tax—it’s a novel chimera composed of an intensity standard, an emissions tax, a tradable permit system, and a subsidy. Mixed together, this policy cocktail might turn out fine, but the unusual design carries likely inefficiencies and a few points of real risk. Let’s call the economics a work in progress.

And then, last week, the initiative ran aground. Last week’s vote was initially viewed as a formality likely to confirm the prior decision, despite a concerted effort from Saudi Arabia and a few others to drum up opposition. But then the Trump administration weighed in forcefully against the initiative, threatening tariffs on member states and implying they would sanction individual delegates who voted in favor. In the end, the IMO buckled under this pressure and delayed the vote by one year. Whether it has a chance of passing later remains to be seen. Let’s call the politics a work in progress as well.

How Would the Policy Work?

—

Each year, ships calculate their GHG Fuel Intensity (GFI)—grams of CO₂-equivalent per megajoule of energy consumed, measured on a lifecycle basis. This intensity gets compared against two thresholds that tighten over time: a Direct Compliance Target and a less stringent (higher emissions) Base Target. I’ll call these Ambition and Baseline.

Source: IMO

Your position relative to these thresholds determines your obligations.

Start with the middle (yellow zone), the easiest case. If your emissions rate falls between Baseline and Ambition, you owe $100 per ton of CO₂e for emissions above Ambition. The only way to satisfy this obligation is buying non-tradable Tier 1 Remedial Units directly from the IMO. You cannot buy credits from cleaner ships. This functions as a straight carbon tax at $100 per ton.

If your emissions exceed Baseline (red zone), things get more expensive. You still owe the $100 tax on emissions between Ambition and Baseline, but for emissions above Baseline, you face a steeper penalty. You can either buy Tier 2 Remedial Units from the IMO for $380 per ton, or—if available—buy excess compliance credits from vessels clean enough to operate in the green zone (below Ambition).

Vessels in the green zone owe nothing but stand to gain in two ways. First, for every ton of CO₂e below Ambition, they generate tradable excess credits that can be sold to red zone vessels. Second, they’re eligible for additional rewards from a fund financed by the policy revenues—a subsidy for early adopters on top of the credit market value.

The Hybrid Donut: Three Scenarios, Three Problems

—

Think about the economic incentives this creates. For green and red zone vessels, we have a cap-and-trade system with a price ceiling of $380 and a price floor of $0. But the middle yellow zone sits outside this trading system, facing a mandatory $100 payment.

This creates what I’m calling a “hybrid donut”—three distinct economic regimes with discontinuous marginal incentives. I can’t think of another policy that looks like this, and for good reason. The odd design creates perverse outcomes that depend on whether tradable credits are scarce or abundant.

Scenario 1: Credits are scarce (price hits $380 ceiling)

If the Ambition benchmark proves tough to achieve—which seems likely given the high cost of complete fuel switching—excess credits will be scarce and trade at the $380 ceiling. In this case, we’ve created a marginal emissions price (opportunity cost) of $380 for clean vessels, $100 for vessels in the middle, then $380 again for the dirtiest ships.

The great virtue of carbon pricing is that it “harvests the low hanging fruit” among abatement opportunities by ensuring every participant faces the same marginal incentive to reduce emissions. Creating two different tiers with vastly different prices erodes that efficiency—vessels in the yellow zone stop abating when the cost per ton reaches $100, but vessels in the other zones keep going until costs are nearly four times higher. This gives them, for example, wildly different incentives to adjust speed or manage routes to reduce emissions.

—

Activity in the red and green zone operates through a tradable permit system, where prices could be high or low, while the yellow zone is a clean tax.

—

Scenario 2: Credits are abundant (price falls to $0 floor)

This is where things get genuinely perverse. If a substantial number of vessels switch to clean ammonia or methanol, excess credits could flood the market and trade near zero. Now consider a vessel operating in the red zone, well above Baseline. It still owes the $100 tax on emissions between Ambition and Baseline. But for emissions above Baseline, it can buy unlimited free credits.

Here’s the problem: if you’re a dirty vessel not contemplating a complete overhaul to get down into the yellow zone, you face zero marginal incentive to reduce emissions to get down to Baseline. Any incremental improvements—better operations, modest efficiency gains—deliver no cost savings because credits are free. The only action that matters is the big one: getting all the way down below Baseline.

This system risks creating a bifurcated market. If success means getting new methanol or ammonia vessels into the green zone, that very success eliminates incentives for the old conventional fleet to gradually improve or even to retire. The more green vessels we have, the cheaper credits become, and the less reason dirty vessels have to clean up or get scrapped. Success breeds failure—progress in one part of the fleet locks in emissions from the worst performers.

Scenario 3: Credits trade between $0 and $380

This gives us a muted version of Scenario 1 or 2, depending where prices settle. We get the same inefficiencies as one of the other two cases, but the price gap is smaller. I won’t pretend to know whether permits will be abundant or scarce, but many cap-and-trade programs have ended up trading at their floor or ceiling.

No economist would design such a system intentionally. Instead, this appears to reflect competing demands that got mashed together rather than reconciled. Some parties wanted an aggressive price signal (the $380 tier). Others demanded guaranteed revenue for island nation aid and subsidies to early adopters (the non-tradable $100 middle band). Still others insisted on compliance flexibility through trading (the cap-and-trade system for green and red zones). Rather than choose among these priorities, the solution was to accommodate all three simultaneously, which produced a policy Frankenstein.

The Performance Standard Problem

—

There’s a second design choice that troubles me: this policy is based on a performance standard (gCO₂eq/MJ) rather than an absolute emissions standard (total gCO₂eq). That distinction matters because economic theory shows a performance standard is equivalent to a tax on emissions (good) plus a subsidy to baseline activity—here, megajoules of energy use (bad).

A performance standard incentivizes cleaner fuels without limiting industry growth—good for politics, but it inadvertently erodes incentives to reduce energy consumption through efficiency measures.

This seems particularly problematic given the IMO’s previous successes with efficiency standards. Research has shown that operational changes—slow steaming, route optimization, hull design improvements—can deliver 10-30% emissions reductions. But under this policy, in Scenario 1 where credits trade at $380, clean vessels could actually maximize credit generation by running longer, farther, and less efficiently to inflate their total MJ consumed while maintaining low gCO₂eq/MJ intensity.

A ship using clean ammonia that takes an unnecessarily long route generates more credits than an identical ship that optimizes for efficiency. That’s backwards.

Conclusion

—

The IMO meeting in London this week proved that even when carbon pricing initially clears a high bar of international consensus with industry support, it can still fail. The world’s biggest fossil fuel producers, led by the US, successfully delayed a policy that would have created the world’s first mandatory sectoral carbon price. The initiative’s future is murky.

What lesson should we draw from this experience? Does this demonstrate that robust carbon pricing is politically impossible? Would some other policy structure that wasn’t a carbon price have managed to pass?

I’m reluctant to embrace the doomer view. Sixty-three countries (initially) voted for this measure. The shipping industry supported it. Island nations backed it. Major economies embraced it. The policy failed to be enacted not because carbon pricing is unworkable, but because one major power, in an exceptional political moment, deployed its leverage to stall something that would have otherwise succeeded.

The fact that it took a historically hostile US administration to prevent a robust sectoral carbon price from being adopted suggests the foundation for carbon pricing is stronger than some pessimists claim. So I’ll keep my glass one-quarter full. There is much room for improvement in the policy, so my hope is that the IMO finds some space to improve the underlying economics, even while it focuses on finding a way to navigate the choppy political waters.

Member states of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) voted on October 17 to postpone by one year negotiations on the Net-Zero Framework, a proposed regulation designed to price greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from marine fuels. Out of 127 countries present, 57 supported the motion to adjourn, led by Saudi Arabia, while 49 opposed and 21 abstained. The adjournment required a simple majority of 54 votes.

The Net-Zero Framework, approved last April by 63 votes to 16, aimed to introduce a pricing mechanism on GHG emissions from bunker fuels starting in 2028. Its objective was to provide a clear market signal to encourage investment in low-carbon marine fuels. The newly approved delay casts doubt on both the implementation timeline and the integrity of the current text, which may need substantial revisions.

Deep divisions among member states

The adjournment motion was driven by a group of fossil fuel-producing countries, including Venezuela, Russia, and lead proponent Saudi Arabia. Additional support came from India, Panama, and other nations that had previously endorsed the framework in April. In contrast, several European countries, Pacific island nations, and Brazil voiced clear opposition to the delay.

A Brazilian delegate warned that the postponement could amount to a de facto rejection, citing the difficulty in preserving key elements of the current text. Japan, Cyprus, and Greece—previous supporters—abstained from the vote, suggesting waning backing for the framework.

Diplomatic pressure and geopolitical tensions

The United States applied considerable diplomatic pressure in the lead-up to the vote. On October 16, President Donald Trump called the framework a “global carbon tax” and declared it unacceptable for the U.S. maritime industry. A joint statement from three U.S. cabinet secretaries threatened retaliatory measures such as increased port fees, sanctions, and restrictions on port and terminal access if the framework were adopted.

Some U.S.-based industry groups, including the Renewable Fuels Association, had expressed support for the regulation due to its market potential for renewable fuels. Following the delay, these groups stated they would continue lobbying in favour of the measure.

Bunker markets face continued regulatory uncertainty

The delay adds further uncertainty to shipowners’ fuel investment decisions. In Singapore, average delivered prices last month stood at $483.73/metric ton for 0.5% sulphur fuel oil, compared with $579.17 for liquefied natural gas (LNG), $691.92 for B24 biobunker fuel, and $1,897.44 for 100% sustainable methanol.

Several maritime organisations reiterated the industry’s need for regulatory clarity. The Secretary General of the International Chamber of Shipping stated that “the industry needs certainty to unlock the required investments.”

Technical talks to continue

Despite the official adjournment, IMO member states will continue technical discussions on the Net-Zero Framework from October 20 to 24 during the Intersessional Working Group on Reduction of GHG from Ships. The IMO Secretary-General said he intends to maintain cooperation among states but acknowledged that “geopolitics currently make it difficult to resolve certain issues.”

The European Commission affirmed its commitment to participate constructively in upcoming talks, while some observers expressed growing doubt about the framework’s future viability.",https://energynews.pro/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/en_1140190947540-1.webp,N,,2025-10-20 14:00:43.734451

After a week of climate negotiations in London, IMO member states opted to delay voting on the framework, which aims to establish the world’s first global carbon pricing mechanism for any industrial sector. The NZF is designed to chart a clear course toward net-zero emissions in international shipping and ensure a level playing field through coordinated global regulation.

For many across the maritime industry, the postponement introduces renewed uncertainty at a critical time. The NZF has been widely regarded as a cornerstone in aligning shipping with global climate goals, setting incentives for cleaner fuels and low-carbon operations.

“We regret today’s postponement of the adoption of the international climate agreement for shipping,” said Sotiris Raptis, Secretary General of European Shipowners (ECSA). “The IMO Net-Zero Framework is essential to give the industry the certainty it needs and to send a strong signal to the market to produce the clean fuels necessary to get to net zero.”

Raptis emphasized that shipping, as a global industry, depends on international rules to decarbonize effectively. Fragmented national or regional policies, he noted, could distort competition and slow down investment in sustainable energy solutions. “Global regulation is essential to ensure a level playing field at international level and to deliver the energy transition of international shipping,” he added.

The delay comes amid growing calls from industry leaders and environmental groups for clear, binding measures to cut emissions from the maritime sector, which carries around 90% of world trade. Many shipowners had hoped the IMO would finalize the framework this year to maintain momentum and give investors confidence in future regulatory stability.

Despite the setback, Raptis confirmed ECSA’s commitment to international cooperation, stating that the organization “will continue to work with our international partners to ensure an agreement on the IMO NZF can be reached.”",https://breakbulk.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/cropped-apple-touch-icon-32x32-optimized.png,N,,2025-10-20 12:56:14.694367

Shanghai, China (20 October 2025) – The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Shanghai Green Shipping Corridor, the first partnership of its kind across the Pacific, reaches a new milestone today.

The LA-LB-SH Green Shipping Corridor (GSC), facilitated by C40 Cities, has successfully delivered on its phase 1 milestones, including the expansion of shore power infrastructure to meet 100% electrification serving container vessels, deploying reduced lifecycle carbon-capable vessels, and scaling sustainable fuel bunkering operations.

Today, the corridor partners will present their second Annual Progress Report at the North Bund International Shipping Forum 2025. The report spotlights the significant progress made by the Partnership since the launch of the GSC, specifically over the past year, and outlines the steps planned to achieve future milestones, including demonstrating the feasibility of deploying zero lifecycle carbon emission container ships by 2030.

2025 Milestones: achievements

In March 2025, partners gathered at the Port of Long Beach for the second in-person meeting, in which the corridor partners reaffirmed their consensus on the corridor goals, further detailed additional actions for addressing challenges, and launched a fourth working group to focus on Metrics and Evaluation.

Along with the other dedicated working groups – Energy Supply, Carriers, and Ports– the partners continue to make progress towards their respective missions:

Ports Working Group

Expanded shore power infrastructure to reach 100% capability in Shanghai, Los Angeles, and Long Beach, cutting emissions while ships are docked and improving air quality for local communities. The Los Angeles and Long Beach Ports completed the installation of shore power to meet earlier mandated State regulations.

Bunkered more than 47,000 tons of green methanol at the Port of Shanghai, and realized China’s first linkage for domestically produced green methanol.

Commissioned a Clean Fuels Study for POLA/POLB and prepared for a clean marine fuel pilot project.

Carriers Working Group

Carriers began deploying reduced lifecycle carbon-capable vessels in 2022 and continue to prepare fleets for a zero-emission future. In 2024, the first green methanol container ship completed its voyage on the corridor.

Prepared deployment plans for vessels with low-carbon emission capability for each shipping company to create a transparent roadmap.

Energy Supply Working Group

Reviewed fuel standards for 2026 adoption, including requirements for fuels’ GHG intensity.

Finalized study on fuel demand and supply for the corridor.

Tracked developments at IMO, the EU, and other organizations and regions on both fuel standards and regulations.

Last week, during the Extraordinary Session of the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC ES.2) in London, countries decided to postpone the decision on the adoption of the Framework to 2026. But important discussions will continue on 20–24 October on key details on clean energy incentives in the Framework, and the organizations stress the importance of preventing biofuels from being included as a supposed “green” alternative to fossil fuels.

Decades of evidence show that indirect land use change (ILUC) emissions from crop-based biofuels – such as soy and oil palm – wipe out their claimed climate benefits, driving forest loss, food insecurity, and land and water grabbing as agriculture is displaced onto marginal or uncultivated land. Soy and oil palm-based biofuels can generate emissions even higher than fossil fuels.

“Biofuels are not a sustainable solution under any circumstances. In Latin America, the push for soy-based biofuels has accelerated deforestation and driven communities off their lands. If the IMO creates new demand for biofuels, it will unleash more emissions, more inequality, and more land grabbing” said Jana Uemura, Climate Campaigner at the Global Forest Coalition.

“Rejecting biofuels in the Net-Zero Framework means protecting the world’s remaining tropical forests – critical carbon sinks and biodiversity hotspots.” said Anggi Putra Prayoga, Forest Campaigner at Forest Watch Indonesia. “The climate crisis is already real. It is crucial to take a firm stance on adopting truly zero-emission energy sources, rather than biofuels that generate new emissions through deforestation.”

The example of Indonesia should be a warning to other countries. In Indonesia, the expansion of palm oil plantations for biofuel continues to drive deforestation – even within protected and conservation forests which are highly vulnerable to climate change. “The loss of forests not only worsens emissions but also endangers the lives and rights of Indigenous peoples who depend on forest resources,” added the Forest Campaigner.

To avoid these impacts, the IMO should make sure high-ILUC fuels are excluded in the Framework. Major national and industry frameworks, including the EU’s Maritime and Aviation policies, the UK SAF Mandate, and the International Civil Aviation Authority’s CORSIA scheme, already exclude or cap high-ILUC biofuels, or include ILUC emissions in the life cycle accounting. The IMO must not fall behind.

“We urge all IMO member governments to take a strong, united stance against the inclusion of biofuels in the Net-Zero Framework” said Pax Butchart, Biofuel Campaigner at Biofuelwatch, “the science is clear: crop-based and waste-derived biofuels cannot deliver real emissions reductions. Governments now have a historic opportunity to steer the shipping sector toward truly clean, zero-emission solutions that protect people and the planet.”

Equally, biofuels produced from waste and residues such as used cooking oil (UCO), have limited availability and scalability, and won’t be able to satisfy the demand of international shipping in the long run.

Recent research estimates that while used cooking oil (UCO) will be the cheapest pathway for compliance, its supply is highly constrained and largely already used in the transport sector. The global waste oil supply currently used for biofuels production could only meet about 5% of shipping’s energy demand, leaving the sector reliant on the next-cheapest compliance pathway, high-ILUC biofuels, with major sustainability risks. UCO and palm derivatives, such as palm oil mill effluent (POME) and palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD), have been associated with fraud, weak auditing and risk displacement from their current use, increasing the use of unsustainable palm oil elsewhere.

If adopted, the Net-Zero Framework would charge vessels of more than 5,000 gross tons between $100 and $380 for every ton of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere, depending on how badly each vessel overshot an emissions target set by the IMO. The stated goal is to end the use of oil in shipping, reducing the sector’s net emissions to zero by 2050.

Global shipping is responsible for just 2% of all greenhouse gas emissions each year, meaning that eliminating all its emissions would have virtually no impact on global climate or temperatures. But the impact of the first global carbon tax would be at least $10 billion a year. That is what proponents, not critics, say. U.N. bureaucrats would then waste the $10 billion on whatever corrupt kickbacks struck their fancy.

While the United States is both a member of the IMO and a signatory to MARPOL Annex VI, nothing in the Net-Zero Framework specifies what would happen to countries that ignore the agreement. Only about 1% of all cargo ships are owned by the U.S., and the flag state of each vessel, the nation where it is registered, would be authorized to collect the tax. The Net-Zero Framework also empowers inspectors to assess the carbon tax at any port a vessel stops at to offload or load cargo.

The Trump administration has always opposed any international environmental agreement that harms our national interests. Last week, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Energy Secretary Chris Wright, and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced strict measures they would take against any country that voted to approve the International Maritime Organization Net-Zero Framework. These include visa restrictions, commercial penalties from contracts with the federal government, port fees, and increased tariffs.

A BAD DAY FOR RACIAL GERRYMANDERING AT THE SUPREME COURT

This worked, with Singapore and Saudi Arabia leading the effort to delay a final vote on the framework for at least a year. In total, 57 countries, including the U.S., voted in favor of delaying the measure, 49 voted against, and 21 abstained. The IMO needs two-thirds of the votes to approve the framework before it can become legally binding.

Trump’s success at blocking the carbon tax is a victory for common sense and American sovereignty. For decades, global bureaucrats have used climate policy as a pretext to siphon billions of dollars from productive nations into corrupt international schemes that punish workers and consumers. By standing up to the IMO’s climate crusade, Trump defended affordable energy, economic growth, and national independence. But this fight isn’t over. The same oligarchy that sought to tax global trade will be back next year. America must remain vigilant and continue leading the world away from destructive globalism and toward true energy freedom.","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AP25218709041842_e82090.jpg?resize=1024,683",N,,2025-10-20 12:56:22.470875

The meeting organised by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) received special attention this year as they debated a legally binding net-zero framework.

The measure would have required all large ships – including cruise ships – to slash emissions 17 per cent by 2028. Led by pressure from the US and Saudi Arabia, however, world leaders postponed a vote on it until the next meeting in 2026.

If adopted, the earliest the measure could go into force will now be March 2028.

While the delay was met with cheers in the US, environmental advocates across the world slammed the inaction. The decision effectively stalls what could have been the world’s first global, legally binding carbon-cutting plan for the shipping sector – one of the planet’s biggest and fastest-growing sources of emissions.

What was at stake?

The resolution, known as the Net-Zero Framework, was the IMO’s most ambitious attempt yet to make the shipping industry accountable for its carbon footprint.

The framework would have introduced a global fuel standard and a carbon pricing system, forcing companies to slash emissions or pay a fee.

Shipping currently accounts for around 3 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions, or about one billion metric tons of carbon dioxide each year, according to the IMO and Climate Watch Data.

Many large ships, including some cruise ships at sea and vessels that transit the Arctic, run on heavy fuel oil. Considered one of the dirtiest fossil fuels, they emit black carbon, methane and sulphur oxides that harm coastal communities and ecosystems.

Had it passed, the framework could have made shipping the first sector in the world to adopt a legally binding, global carbon price, and potentially eliminated up to one billion metric tons of carbon annually by 2050, according to the Ocean Conservancy.

Delaine McCullough, shipping program director at Ocean Conservancy, calls the failure to come to an agreement “a major setback for people and the planet.”

“The agreement would have slashed carbon emissions and saved lives,” says McCullough. “A world without this agreement is dirtier and more dangerous for people, wildlife and the ocean.”

How it unravelled over four days

The Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC), the IMO body responsible for the decision, remained divided throughout four days of tense negotiations.

On the final day, 57 member states voted to adjourn for a year, while 49 voted to continue, effectively stalling progress for now.

Behind the scenes, the US reportedly led an aggressive campaign to block the vote.

President Donald Trump branded the proposal a “Global Green New Scam Tax on Shipping,” warning that the US “would not adhere to it in any way, shape or form.”

His Secretary of State Marco Rubio called the outcome “a huge win” for the White House, claiming it protected consumers from a “massive UN tax hike.”

The US was joined by Saudi Arabia, Russia and other oil-producing states in “delay tactics,” according to environmental group Seas at Risk and others.

The rhetoric mirrored the divisions seen at COP29, which went into overtime to avoid a similar collapse due to a lack of consensus. But while COP negotiators managed to strike a deal on climate finance before the conference ended, the IMO talks ended in stalemate.

“Emotions have run high this week, with once high-ambitious alliances wavering and strategies eclipsing reason,” said Anaïs Rios, senior shipping policy officer at Seas at Risk.

“Few expected a postponement to prevail but here we are. The planet and the future of shipping do not have time to waste.”

What does the delay mean for the planet?

Using IMO data, the International Council of Clean Transportation predicts shipping could account for as much as 17 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.

Experts say the delay makes it harder for the industry to meet its own 2030 and 2050 climate goals. Each year of inaction not only affects carbon taxes, it also risks locking in polluting infrastructure for decades, as ship lifespans often exceed 25 years.

“Today’s adjournment is a disappointing setback for shipping, but not the end of this journey,” said Jesse Fahnestock, director of decarbonisation at the Global Maritime Forum.

“The adjournment for a full year creates serious challenges for meeting the timelines in the Net Zero Framework agreed in April and will make delivery of the sector’s decarbonisation targets even more challenging.”

While environmental groups called the decision “a disgrace,” the IMO’s secretary general, Arsenio Dominguez, urged patience, saying the body would reconvene in October 2026 to continue talks.

Even if business as usual prevails, critics say there is hope for change on the horizon.

“While this delay is a serious setback, there is still a major opportunity to put the sector on a zero-emission pathway,” McCullough notes.

In April, the IMO will continue to revise the Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII), its measure of operational efficiency, she explains. The organisation aims to make the CII more stringent to align with its goal of reducing emissions by 30 per cent by 2030.

“Strengthening the CII is absolutely critical to immediate emission reductions,” she says, “[and] necessary to meet the IMO’s 2030 goals.”",https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/09/51/93/93/1200x675_cmsv2_f818c369-02f4-5d89-bd74-8c47a41833d3-9519393.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 11:20:28.851233

The proposal was strongly opposed by the US, while Greece – whose influence on global shipping is significant due to the size of the Greek-owned fleet – as well as Cyprus, had previously expressed serious reservations. According to information, Greece had chosen to abstain if the vote took place.

A four-day thriller of political back-and-forth, public warnings and backroom negotiations preceded the IMO meeting in London, which was aimed at approving or rejecting a new NZF. However, the US and several other countries strongly opposed it. The vote was initially postponed from day to day and then, on Friday, the last day of the session, from hour to hour. It was finally decided to postpone the vote for another year.

Sources say the Greek delegation had been instructed to abstain if the vote was eventually held, a decision interpreted as maintaining equal distances between the EU and the US.

A day earlier, on Thursday, the US president had said on social media that he was “outraged” by the initiative and would not support a “global green new shipping fraud tax… in any way.” “Stand with the US and vote NO in London,” he wrote on Truth Social.

The NZF is a new regulatory system proposed for global shipping to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. It establishes a legally binding global framework with a mandatory greenhouse gas fuel intensity standard and a pricing mechanism: Ships exceeding certain emission limits would pay a fine, while those with the best performance would earn credits to trade. However, it remains unclear exactly how these funds would be managed.

Washington had warned countries supporting the NZF before Friday of visa restrictions for crews, additional port fees, and sanctions against officials.

Let us hope that last week’s MEPC failure does not mark the start of a new era of fragmented, overlapping, and conflicting regional regulation.","The IMO’s Net Zero Framework is effectively dead, and the broader role of the MEPC is now in question. Friday’s unprecedented vote represents a severe setback for multilateral climate action. It is difficult to see how a one-year delay will change the deeply rooted opposition from states such as the US or Saudi Arabia.

This is bad news for the net-zero transition — and bad news for shipping. The regulatory trajectory is now uncertain, and the policy landscape risks becoming fragmented, creating a more complex and therefore more expensive environment for investment decisions on fuels, engines, and energy-saving technologies.

What to expect next:

Stronger push for regional regulation. Pressure will increase to expand and enforce local/regional schemes. The UK has already signalled plans to extend its ETS (due July 2026) to cover voyages to and from the UK if the IMO framework fails. Others like Turkey, the African Union, China, etc. are likely to explore copycat schemes modelled after the EU ETS. This will not only drive up costs but will massively increase compliance complexity.

EU ETS expansion becomes more likely. The inclusion of vessels below 5,000 GT in the EU ETS, currently scheduled for 2027, now looks more probable. Any softening or alignment of FuelEU Maritime with global regulation is unlikely — the IMO NZF will not materialise, and FuelEU Maritime is here to stay. Get your contractual clauses agreed and signed.

Pooling stays alive under FuelEU. Under the original NZF plan, commercial pooling would have been effectively eliminated by 2028. With NZF off the table, pooling will remain — and strategies must adjust accordingly.

Biofuels and e-fuels outlook shifts. Their case is now weakened and largely confined to European trading for the foreseeable future. In the short term, this may ease supply constraints — but long term, it risks slowing the essential build-up of production capacity and infrastructure.

Shipping has long been a global regulatory success story — one of the very few industries capable of agreeing and implementing uniform rules at global scale, not just on environmental issues. This is a remarkable achievement. Let us hope that last week’s MEPC failure does not mark the start of a new era of fragmented, overlapping, and conflicting regional regulation. The resulting inefficiencies would set the industry back on a scale we have never seen before.",https://oceanscore.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/WhatsApp-Image-2025-03-25-at-11.10.51.jpeg,N,,2025-10-20 14:00:51.501147

More than 100 member states of the Marine Environment Protection Committee gathered in London to ratify the Net Zero Framework (NZF), developed by the UN’s International Maritime Organisation (IMO) and finalised in April after a decade of talks.

The framework incentivises ships – regardless of their flag – to adopt cleaner technologies and fuels, while those using high-intensity fuels would face charges based on the greenhouse gases they emit.

Opposing countries – including Russia, China, Saudi Arabia, and the US – argue the plan would raise costs for consumers, energy providers and ship operators. The US has gone further, accusing it of imposing “a carbon tax on the world”, a claim the IMO firmly denies.

Thomas A Kazakos, the secretary general of the International Chamber of Shipping (ICS), said: “We are disappointed that member states have not been able to agree a way forward at this meeting.

“Industry needs clarity to be able to make the investments needed to decarbonise the maritime sector, in line with the goals set out in the IMO greenhouse gas strategy.”

Trump offensive

The US has pushed back against the NZF since April, with President Trump calling the initiative a “green scam” on his Truth Social platform.

Before the meeting the US set out actions it would impose on countries in favour of the framework, including port fees and commercial penalties on ships.

A spokesperson from the US Department of State, said: “The United States will be moving to levy these remedies against nations that sponsor this European-led neocolonial export of global climate regulations. We will fight hard to protect our economic interests by imposing costs on countries if they support the NZF.”

Year-long delay

The IMO have confirmed that talks on the NZF will reconvene in 12 months, with space for amendments.

Critics have railed against the adjournment, worrying that a year-long delay would make international net-zero targets unfeasible.

Alice Larkin, professor of climate science and energy policy at the University of Manchester, said: “With a global carbon budget associated with a 50:50 chance of avoiding 1.5C of warming set to be exhausted in less than three years, it is clear how significant and disastrous a one-year delay in any mitigation effort is for people and the planet.”",https://www.thechemicalengineer.com/media/23029/shipping.jpg?width=960,N,,2025-10-20 11:20:37.892480

It says the IMO had been due to finalise a deal, agreed in April, that would have “made shipping the first global industry subject to a carbon pricing system”. The Financial Times describes the “eleventh-hour” delay as a “major victory” for “Donald Trump’s campaign to block a climate agreement for the global shipping industry” and “part of the wider Trump administration drive to sell more of its oil, coal and gas”. It says that before last week’s talks, the US had “warned that countries that backed the measure could face their vessels being blocked, visa restrictions and commercial penalties”. The newspaper adds: “The move [to postpone the decision for a year] was likely to spell the death of the agreement, some observers said, despite previous support for the deal from the EU, UK, India, China and Brazil.”

The Associated Press says “nations will continue to negotiate and work toward consensus” on the deal. It adds: “Ralph Regenvanu, minister for climate change for the Pacific Island nation of Vanuatu, said the road to [COP30 in] Belém and beyond is now more difficult.” The New York Times says the US succeeded in securing a delay after using a “battering ram of trade and visa threats”, in an effort that was supported by Russia and Saudi Arabia. The Washington Post says the delay came after “threats” from Trump. Separate articles from Agence France-Presse report the UN calling the delay a “missed opportunity”, the European Commission saying it was “regrettable” and US secretary of state Marco Rubio describing it as a “huge win”. Reuters reports: “Danish shipping company Maersk said the IMO’s decision was a loss of momentum for the industry’s efforts to decarbonise.”

Climate Home News notes that the IMO’s “net-zero framework” had been due to set emissions reduction targets for ships starting in 2028, adding that this timeline has been “plunged into doubt”. [See the Carbon Brief Q&A on the provisional deal for details.] BBC News, CNN, the Wall Street Journal, Independent, Guardian, Bloomberg, Le Monde, Daily Telegraph and Politico also have the story. In related comment, an editorial in the Wall Street Journal welcomes the decision to delay the deal. It mischaracterises what was a vote by IMO member countries as a “UN agency…[that was] about to impose the first global carbon tax…blink[ing]”.

The UK government has launched a “national plan to train people for an extra 400,000 green jobs in the next five years”, double the current number, the Guardian reports. It continues: “The energy secretary [Ed Miliband] unveiled a scheme to double the number of people working in green industries by 2030, with a particular focus on training those coming from fossil fuel jobs, school leavers, the unemployed, veterans and ex-offenders.” The newspaper adds: “Miliband said the national plan ‘answers a key question about where the good jobs of the future will come from’…Miliband said the promise of hundreds of thousands of new roles in the renewables and clean-energy sector would show that Reform UK is ‘waging war on jobs’ by challenging the switch to net-zero.”

Reuters adds: “The government said that recent public and private investment in clean energy, such as renewables and nuclear, was driving a surge in demand for industrial workers, with plumbers, electricians, and welders especially sought after. Under the new plans, five new colleges will train young people for clean-energy careers, while a national programme will help connect workers with jobs in solar installation, wind turbine manufacturing, and nuclear power.” The Daily Mirror reports: “Miliband says Tory and Reform net-zero critics are ‘anti-worker’ as he unveils green jobs bonanza.” The Press Association, BusinessGreen, BBC News and Daily Express all cover the story. The Sun buries its coverage under a headline about migration, while the Daily Telegraph leads with the line that Miliband has been “ridiculed [by Reform] over plans to rebrand plumbers, electricians and welders as ‘clean energy’ workers”. In related news, the Times reports on warnings that the government is losing support to the Greens.

The Times reports new figures from consultancy Oxera showing that only 5% of UK emissions reductions in recent decades have resulted from “offshoring”. The Daily Telegraph reports separate analysis, commissioned by shadow minister Nick Timothy, which it says shows “up to 15%” of cuts were due to offshoring.

BBC News reports that Scottish first minister John Swinney “has said that Scotland and its government has a ‘moral obligation’ to support countries facing severe effects of climate change”. Another BBC News piece asks if the Scottish government is “softening” in its opposition to oil and gas.

ReNews says the government has confirmed a “single timetable” for the AR7 renewable auction, with results due to be published on 14 January 2026.

BBC News reports on plans from Chinese firm Ming Yang to invest £1.5bn in a wind turbine factory in Scotland under the headline: “Friend or foe? The China challenge on the Moray Firth.” The Daily Mail says “ministers [have been] warned of security risk” over the plans, also covered by the Scotsman and the Daily Telegraph.

The Times says the government competition to select successful developers of small modular reactors has cost £22m.

The Daily Telegraph has a feature on UK plans for “colossal investment” in carbon capture and storage, which it presents under a headline claiming: “Miliband’s £22bn CO2 vision risks crashing into reality.”

Energy secretary Ed Miliband has “given the strongest hint yet” that the government might cut VAT from household energy bills at the budget in late November, the Financial Times reports. It says that Miliband, when asked directly about VAT on bills in an interview with the BBC, responded that the “whole of the government…understands that we face an affordability crisis in this country”. The newspaper adds: “Scrapping it would save a household with average usage about £86 a year, according to the charity Nesta, and cost the government about £2.5bn a year. Last month Nesta’s Marcus Shepheard questioned whether a VAT cut was the best way to lower energy bills.” BBC News also describes Miliband’s response as a “hint…at a cut to VAT”. It says that Miliband “told the BBC’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme he stood by that promise [to lower bills by £300 by 2030], but [said] the reason bills were so high was ‘because of our dependence on fossil fuels’.” The broadcaster also reports Miliband saying the government was “look[ing] at” the levies on bills that fund climate and social policy, which could be funded through taxes instead.

The Daily Telegraph, Daily Mail, another Daily Telegraph article and the i newspaper all cover the Miliband interview and possible changes to bills. Separately, the Sun speculates on other changes that could be in the upcoming budget, including a “pay-per-mile road charge for electric vehicles”, a rise in fuel duty rates and a cut in VAT on public EV charging. Another Sun article says the chancellor is “looking at electric vehicle drivers paying their fair share of tax in a budget revenue-raiser” and points to ideas including “levies on the weight of the car or a pay-per-mile system”.

MORE ON MILIBAND

The Sun says opposition Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has claimed that Miliband is “binding Britain to Beijing” and is attempting to tie the government’s climate plans to a collapsed and unrelated spying case.

The Independent reports that Conservative shadow energy secretary Claire Coutinho “would not be drawn on when a Conservative government might aim to reach net-zero after her party pledged to scrap the 2050 target”. It quotes her telling the BBC that “decarbonisation is not a bad thing”, but that “we don’t have a target”.

The Daily Express says Miliband has “refused to rule out development of the Rosebank oil field”. The Daily Telegraph reports claims that an extra 1.1bn barrels of oil has been “found in the North Sea”.

The Daily Express personal finance editor Harvey Jones claims, in an article that is not labelled as comment, that Miliband is “out of control”.

For the Financial Times, global business columnist and associate editor Rana Foroohar says the US-China dispute over rare-earth elements is “hard to see…as anything other than shadow boxing”. She continues: “China’s export controls on the sector and ringfencing of critical minerals – which are needed for everything from semiconductors and electric vehicles to smartphones and fighter jets – is a big hit to the US.” Foroohar explains that China has “never made any secret of its desire” to dominate the industry, pointing out that “Deng Xiaoping announced the country’s desire to turn rare earths into the ‘oil’ of China” in 1992. She concludes: “[T]he Trump White House is doubling down on…pouring hundreds of millions of dollars in investments and loans into jump-starting critical mineral mining and production in the US. The only surprise in all of this is that it took so long. I predict both the shadow boxing – and the race to rebuild strategic sectors – will continue.”

An editorial in the Wall Street Journal says US treasury secretary Scott Bessent is “right” to “coordinate with allies to counter China’s weaponisation of rare-earth minerals”, but adds that this might have been easier if Trump was not “also hitting our allies with unprovoked unilateral tariffs”. For the Daily Telegraph, industry editor Matt Oliver writes that China “has a stranglehold over the key technologies other countries need to hit net-zero”.

MORE COMMENT

In a comment for the Daily Express, the Grantham Institute’s Bob Ward writes under the headline: “Climate change could make it dangerous for humans to go outside – we must act.”

An editorial in the Guardian says plug-in hybrid electric vehicles “pollute more than their manufacturers claim – and delay the real shift to electric and shared mobility”.

A comment for Bloomberg by BNEF analyst Colin McKerracher says European carmakers “ought to be careful what they wish for” on vehicle CO2 standards.

For Climate Home News, Sergio Diaz, legal director of the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty, calls for countries to “confront fossil fuels head on” in their new climate pledges under the Paris Agreement.

The Wall Street Journal carries a comment calling for more focus on adapting to climate change, by Kalee Kreider, principal of consultancy the Kreider Group and Alex Flint, of the Alliance for Market Solutions.

In a comment for the Daily Express, UK energy secretary Ed Miliband writes that he is “determined that the clean-energy revolution being delivered by this government must deliver for the workers and communities that power it”. He continues: “That means providing new opportunities for decent jobs at fair wages to communities up and down our country. From building new nuclear in Somerset and Suffolk to carbon capture in the Humber.” Miliband says there “could be more than 800,000” clean-energy jobs by 2030 – double the current number – and that “veterans should be first on the list for these new opportunities”.

An editorial in the Sunday Mirror responds to the jobs plan and says: “Climate change sceptics are not just ignoring the damage it does but also failing to recognise the economic benefits net-zero will bring.” It adds: “Focusing on renewables and nuclear power is undeniably the future. If we do not lead the field in technology now we will suffer the cost of importing it later.” A contrasting editorial in the climate-sceptic Sun claims – without evidence – that the 400,000 planned new clean-energy jobs is “far fewer than the number of jobs [Miliband’s] policies are costing in other sectors”. The Daily Mirror carries a comment by Paul Nowak, general secretary of the TUC union welcomes the government’s “serious plan”, writing: “[T]his plan is about giving working people a future. It’s about making sure no community is left behind as we move to cleaner, greener energy.”

MORE UK COMMENT

In the Guardian, senior economics writer Philip Inman writes under the headline: “Ed Miliband needs a plan for industry – without it, the move to net-zero could ruin UK manufacturing.”

A new treatise on the UK called “prosperity through growth” is touted by its authors in the comment pages of the Times and the Daily Express. The authors – including long-standing opponents of climate action Matthew Elliott and Michael Hintze – call for “smart net-zero”, without explanation as to what this might mean.

The Sun gives space to climate-sceptic celebrity Jeremy Clarkson to criticise “Labour eco-loons”. The Daily Express deems his thoughts worthy of news coverage.

Daily Telegraph columnist Janet Daley rails against the “malignancy” of those protesting on “Vietnam, climate change, Gaza”.

For the Sunday Times, Martin Pibworth, chief executive of energy firm SSE writes: “Investing for a net-zero future isn’t responsible for rising prices. Instead, upgrades to home-grown electricity will improve energy security and cut costs.” Pushing back on recent arguments, he adds that expected reductions in wholesale energy costs “will help fund essential upgrades to our grid”. Pibworth continues: “I simply don’t buy the argument that the cost of the investments needed by the country are pushing up bills. We’re already seeing the benefit of these investments coming through. One of the reasons our bills have been so high is that the cost of electricity is linked to the price of gas, which is one of the most expensive fuels in the system. But renewables are setting the wholesale price more and more of the time, bringing down the influence of gas on the power price.” He says there is “no credible alternative” to continuing to invest in clean energy and adds: “Will future energy bills depend less on global price swings and more on fixed costs? Well, yes – that’s sort of the point. We’ve all seen what happens when you’re too dependent on imported fossil fuels.”

In contrast, an editorial in the climate-sceptic comment pages of the Daily Telegraph runs under the headline: “The headlong rush to net-zero must stop before we are all ruined.” An editorial in the climate-sceptic Daily Mail criticises Miliband as “pompous and patronising”, falsely blaming high energy bills on “Miliband’s green taxes”.

A landmark vote on maritime decarbonisation has been postponed until 2026 after a motion tabled by Singapore and advanced by Saudi Arabia narrowly passed on the final day of the Marine Environment Protection Committee’s extraordinary session in London.

The result was 57 in favour and 49 against, with 21 abstentions – a tight margin that sends mixed signals to C-level executives attempting to strategise for future logistics costs and environmental compliance.

The session is now adjourned for 12 months, during which negotiations are expected to continue.

In his closing remarks, IMO Secretary General Arsenio Dominguez said: ""I always look for the silver linings in things. Even though you have difference of opinions, you all spoke in support of the work of this organisation. I will ask you to reflect on this session. The outcome is your decision.""

""Now, you have one year; you will continue to work on several aspects of these amendments. You have one year to negotiate and talk and come to a consensus that you make reference to.""

The net-zero framework

The delayed framework is an important piece of regulation that would apply from 2028 to ships over 5,000 gross tonnes.

For procurement departments, its core components represent a tangible future cost.

The NZF establishes binding targets to reduce the carbon intensity of marine fuels and creates a market-based mechanism involving credits and penalties. Under the proposed rules, ships exceeding emission limits would be required to purchase “remedial units”.

In contrast, low-emission vessels could earn and trade surplus credits. The revenue generated would be directed into an IMO Net-Zero Fund.

The fund is intended to support the adoption of clean fuels and assist developing countries in a just transition.

The delay now gives procurement teams more time to model these potential costs, but clouds the timeline for implementation.

Geopolitical pressure and regulatory headwinds

According to the Global Strategic Communications Council, momentum appeared strong for the framework in April when 63 countries backed the package against 16 opposed.

This support wavered as the October vote approached amid intense geopolitical pressure. Delegations from some developing countries cited “undiplomatic” pressure from the US, including threats of tariffs if they supported the framework.

The US position hardened publicly when President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social: “I am outraged that the International Maritime Organization is voting in London this week to pass a global Carbon Tax.”

His post framed the NZF as a Global Green New Deal Tax on Shipping and stated that the US would not adhere to it, urging other member states to vote 'no'.

Future-proofing procurement strategies

An 11 August submission from the US argued that the NZF would establish a de facto global carbon tax, potentially causing inflationary effects for consumers.

It also highlights that zero- and near-zero fuels are not yet commercially available at the required scale and that the framework's GHG Fuel Intensity metric could penalise transitional fuels like liquefied natural gas (LNG).

The latest IMO vote represents a critical juncture for procurement leaders whose organisations may have already invested in such transitional technologies.

For both procurement and supply chain executives, a one-year pause changes project timelines but not the fundamental direction of the industry, with the regulatory trajectory continuing to point towards carbon pricing and lifecycle fuel assessments.

Procurement teams should still operate on the assumption that Scope 3 emissions from ocean freight will carry a rising cost, even if the exact start date remains uncertain. Companies with diversified fuel strategies and robust efficiency programmes could maintain a competitive advantage when credit markets are eventually established.

Charterers and their procurement departments would be wise to use this additional year to tighten contract clauses that allocate carbon price and performance risk.

Similarly, logistics partners, including ports and third-party logistics providers (3PLs) investing in infrastructure for methanol, ammonia and shore power, have another 12 months to align capital expenditure with the likely shape of the final regulations.

The UN-associated body announced Friday that voting on the adoption of the framework, which aims to reduce global shipping emissions, would be postponed by a year.

The framework includes a greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) pricing mechanism and global fuel standards, measures UBS said were expected to boost demand for Accelleron’s turbochargers, fuel injection pumps, and routing software.

With the delay, UBS shifted its assumptions for regulatory-driven demand, now expecting top-line support for Accelleron starting in fiscal year 2027, instead of fiscal 2026, and a more gradual phase-in thereafter.

UBS revised its earnings per share forecasts in Swiss francs to reflect the delayed demand tailwind. Adjusted EPS estimates remain unchanged for FY25 at current levels but were lowered by 4% for FY26 and 3% for FY27.

The brokerage also reduced its price target to CHF69 from CHF75 while maintaining a Buy rating on the company.

The IMO’s planned GHG pricing mechanism is designed to encourage emission reductions across global shipping fleets.

Under the proposal, fleets exceeding IMO-defined emission thresholds would be required to purchase “remedial units,” with costs ranging from $100 million to $380 million per ton of CO2 depending on the level of non-compliance. Fleets below thresholds can generate “surplus units” that may be traded.

UBS estimated that funds linked to the emission trading scheme could exceed $10 billion annually once fully adopted, potentially increasing demand for emission-reducing equipment like that produced by Accelleron.

Valuation was updated using a discounted cash flow model incorporating the revised FY25-29 estimates, a terminal sales growth assumption of 2.5%, and a weighted average cost of capital of 7.2%.

By delaying adoption of its Net Zero Framework, IMO has today squandered an important opportunity to tackle global shipping’s contribution to climate breakdown.

…said John Maggs, the Clean Shipping Coalition’s Representative at the IMO.

Maggs also highlighted that with climate warming impacts being felt everywhere on Earth, kicking this decision down the road is simply evading reality. Governments serious about climate action must spend the next 12 months rallying every nation that supports the framework, convincing those who are on the fence, or opposing, that its adoption is the only sane way forward.

However, all is not lost – not by a long shot, as there is an immediate opportunity to slash GHG emissions from shipping, minimize fuel burn and the overall cost of the energy transition and that is to strengthen and make enforceable the Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII), the IMO’s cornerstone energy efficiency measure

…added Maggs.

Furthermore, John Maggs commented that at MEPC 84 April 2026 member states need to focus all their attention on transforming the CII into the energy efficiency powerhouse needed to quickly right this ship and put it back on route to being a climate solution.

Echoing the IMO General Secretary’s statement, Maggs underscored that while the Net-Zero Framework is far from perfect, adopting it would have been an important step to deliver on the IMOs commitment and send key signals to an industry that was not only asking for a global framework, but actively supported this deal.

Delay costs the climate — and coastal, Indigenous Peoples and Arctic communities are already paying the price for inaction. This week’s non-outcome should mean that states and the marine sector should double down on related efforts to reduce the impacts from the triple planetary crisis.

…said Elissama Menezes, Co-Founder and Director, Equal Routes.

“Implementing revised Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII) targets to improve efficiency of the global fleet; investing in wind to promote its scaling up; agreeing to comprehensive well to wake LCA guidelines which ensure all methane based fuels aren’t part of decarbonation pathways; and adopting mandatory measures in early 2026 at PPR13 to reduce black carbon from shipping emissions can all be moved on now to support the sector’s zero by 2050 ambitions”, she added.

Furthermore, Alison Shaw, IMO Manager at Transport & Environment, explained that the delay leaves the shipping sector drifting in uncertainty. But this week has also shown that there is a clear desire to clean up the shipping industry, even in the face of US ‘bullying’.

The world cannot let intimidation and vested interests dictate the pace of climate action. Climate-ambitious countries must use this moment to build a strong majority in support of meaningful decarbonisation. They will be the ones that benefit from the economy of tomorrow, not the geopolitical power games of the past.

…Shaw highlighted.

Anaïs Rios, Senior Shipping Policy Officer, Seas At Risk, noted that getting the Net-Zero Framework adopted in this MEPC ES.2, however imperfect, was fundamental for shipping to stay within reach of its own decarbonation targets.

Emotions have run high this week at the IMO, with once high-ambitious alliances wavering and strategies eclipsing reason. With talk of unity versus division, no single flag should dictate the world’s climate course.

…said Rios.

Rios also remarked that with countries like Saudi Arabia leading efforts to delay, few expected a postponement to prevail. What matters now is that countries rise up and come back to the IMO with a louder and more confident yes vote that cannot be silenced. The planet and the future of shipping does not have time to waste” she said.

The adoption of Net-Zero Framework would have marked a crucial first step toward reducing global shipping emissions and supporting vulnerable countries in the transition.

…Jenny Helle, Expert on Decarbonisation of Aviation and Shipping at Carbon Market Watch, pointed out and further explained that far from rushed, the framework represented years of negotiations, research, and collective effort.

It was a clear and urgent demand from both the industry and the public. Yet, due to pressure from the Trump administration and major fossil fuel producing countries, this opportunity for progress was lost. We now urge the public and industry to keep pushing for immediate action to cut emissions from global shipping.

“Stand with the United States and vote NO in London tomorrow,” US President Donald Trump urged other members of the International Maritime Organization via his Truth Social account on X. On Friday, 56 countries obeyed.

In April 2025, a draft agreement was made to set mandatory emissions limits and greenhouse gas pricing for the shipping sector. Last week, the deal should have been formally adopted. Yet Trump’s threats, along with no love for the deal from recalcitrant petrostate allies such as Saudi Arabia, meant enough countries came together to reject it.

The net zero framework is the intended pathway for the IMO, the UN’s body for global shipping, to bring international shipping in line with its 2023 greenhouse gas strategy.

Under the rules, vessels of more than 5,000 gross tonnage would have to hit a “base” target of reducing carbon dioxide emissions from their fuels by 4 per cent or face a tax of $380 a tonne for emissions above this level.

A majority of the 176 IMO member states — 63 — had approved the carbon pricing mechanism in April, with 16 countries against it and the rest abstaining. But UN procedure stated that it had to be reaffirmed by two-thirds of members last week.

No clarity for industry

Negotiations on a decarbonisation framework for shipping have been ongoing for two decades.

Global Maritime Forum director of decarbonisation Jesse Fahnestock said Friday’s decision was “a disappointing setback for shipping, but not the end of this journey”.

He invited countries supportive of the NZF to “reconfirm their commitment to multilateralism and continue the urgent work of developing guidelines and adopting a regulatory framework that can deliver on the IMO’s unanimously agreed greenhouse gas strategy”.

The Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller Center for Zero Carbon Shipping insisted the delay did “not mean the framework has failed”. The 2023 GHG strategy remains in place, said the research centre, calling for shipping to reach net zero emissions by 2050.

While the delay provides additional time to build consensus . . . momentum appears to be fading, making agreement increasingly difficult. Continued procrastination could ultimately lead to cancellation

Rico Luman, ING

It admitted, however, that: “For now, the industry will not have the clarity it needs on a global set of rules and incentives to drive investment.”

And the centre called on IMO member states to use the next 12 months to achieve a global framework that can deliver certainty for long-term planning and investment, incentives to accelerate innovation and deployment of sustainable solutions, and fairness through a just and equitable transition for developing states.

Fading momentum

But others were less optimistic about a greener future for shipping.

Rico Luman, senior economist for transport and logistics at Dutch bank ING, said the delay “reduces the likelihood of passing the previously agreed proposal” and “is likely to strengthen opposition”.

“While the delay provides additional time to build consensus — also within different shipping segments — momentum appears to be fading, making agreement increasingly difficult,” he added. “Continued procrastination could ultimately lead to cancellation.”

Luman warned that projected CO₂ reductions by 2030 “already fall short of earlier ambitions”, and that achieving the 2040 and 2050 targets set out in the IMO’s net zero strategy “is becoming increasingly challenging — particularly given the long investment horizons typical in the shipping industry”.

Research published last month showed the sector was not on target to meet an interim target mandating that zero or near-zero emission fuels represent at least 5 per cent of the sector’s fuel use by 2030.

Luman added: “From an economic standpoint, introducing carbon pricing is essential to level the playing field with sustainable fuels, which are currently not economically viable. Regardless of the timing, a pricing mechanism will eventually be necessary to drive progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, also as it helps funding green investments.”

EU versus the US

Trump had already made clear earlier this year that the US would be an obstructive force, repeatedly threatening other IMO member states with retaliatory tariffs if they approved the proposal.

The EU, on the other hand, had signalled its backing for the deal ahead of Friday’s meeting.

The EU fought until the very last moment to get the IMO NZF across the finishing line, but the bully who played dirty was ultimately stronger

Faig Abbasov, T&E

“The EU fought until the very last moment to get the IMO NZF across the finishing line, but the bully who played dirty was ultimately stronger,” said Faig Abbasov, shipping director at non-profit Transport & Environment.

“The EU has its own climate laws for international shipping. These need to be safeguarded and strengthened in the coming years,” he added. “The bloc must also work with other countries bilaterally to help them develop their own national rules.”

No satisfying Trump

T&E executive director William Todts said the EU should take wider lessons from Friday’s decision.

“The US under Trump is not looking to slow down clean energy and climate action,” wrote Todts on LinkedIn. “It wants to destroy it. The sooner we fully accept the implications of this, the better.

“No amount of concessions will ever satisfy Trump and the fossil fuel guys that work for him. Some Europeans thought sacrificing the EU’s shipping rules might appease the Donald and his friends. He killed the deal anyway.”

Todts urged the EU to “better remember that when he goes after CBAM [Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism]”.",https://d2iztrg3kgqpue.cloudfront.net/production/c6177312-1677-4665-a147-1993b412af9e.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 07:19:24.880620

How will the maritime industry and global policymakers reconcile economic interests with the urgent need for environmental action in the coming years?","The maritime industry, a critical player in global trade, faces a crossroads as international efforts to regulate its emissions hit a significant roadblock. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) recently postponed a decision on imposing a landmark charge on vessel emissions. This decision highlights the complexities of international climate diplomacy, especially amid strong opposition from the Trump administration. The proposed rules, which would have been the first global fixed charge on emissions for any industry, have been years in the making. The delay raises important questions about the future of environmental regulation and the global commitment to reducing carbon emissions.

Trump Administration’s Influence on Global Regulations

The postponement of the IMO’s decision underscores the influence of the Trump administration on international environmental policy. The U.S. strongly opposed the proposed ship emissions charges, framing them as a “global carbon tax” that would disproportionately impact American businesses. This stance reflects a broader pattern of resistance to multilateral environmental agreements under Trump’s leadership.

U.S. officials warned of potential economic repercussions, suggesting that shipping costs could increase by up to 10 percent or more. The administration’s rhetoric included threats of port levies, visa restrictions, and commercial penalties against countries supporting the emissions charge. Such measures highlight the administration’s aggressive approach to safeguarding national economic interests at the expense of global environmental initiatives.

In addition to direct opposition, the U.S. proposed procedural changes to the adoption process, advocating for an explicit opt-in requirement from nations. This shift from a “tacit acceptance” process would create additional hurdles for implementing the emissions charge, further complicating international consensus.

Global Reactions and Shifting Alliances

The U.S. stance has had a noticeable impact on international alliances concerning the emissions charge. While the plan initially had widespread support, recent developments reveal signs of wavering among key nations. For instance, Athens, traditionally skeptical due to potential impacts on its maritime industry, considered abstaining from the vote.

Singapore, once a supporter of the plan, joined Saudi Arabia in suggesting a delay in voting. This shift indicates a recalibration of priorities in the face of U.S. pressure and the economic ramifications of the proposed charge. The postponement marks a setback for those advocating for stringent environmental regulations within the shipping industry.

The International Chamber of Shipping expressed disappointment with the delay, emphasizing the need for regulatory clarity to enable investments in decarbonizing the sector. This sentiment echoes a broader frustration among stakeholders eager for decisive action to address the maritime industry’s environmental impact.

Implications for Climate Policy and Emissions Reduction

The delay in implementing the carbon levy highlights the broader challenges facing international climate diplomacy. Despite the withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, the U.S. continues to wield significant influence over global climate talks. The maritime industry’s emissions, accounting for over one percent of global totals, represent a substantial target for regulatory efforts.

The planned emissions charge was a key component of the IMO’s strategy to achieve net-zero emissions in the maritime sector by mid-century. However, the delay threatens the timeline for reaching this ambitious goal. The Trump administration’s actions reflect a broader trend of dismantling domestic climate policies and challenging international efforts to curb emissions.

As companies reassess their climate commitments amid shifting political landscapes, the marketing advantages of green credentials are waning. The reality of meeting ambitious emissions targets is becoming increasingly complex, raising questions about the future of voluntary corporate sustainability initiatives.

Looking Ahead: The Future of Maritime Emissions Regulation

The postponement of the emissions charge vote leaves the maritime industry in a state of uncertainty. The IMO’s inability to reach a consensus at this juncture underscores the difficulties inherent in coordinating international climate policy across diverse economic and political landscapes.

For the industry to progress toward decarbonization, clear and consistent regulations are essential. The delay in implementing the carbon levy complicates investment decisions and strategic planning for companies committed to reducing their environmental impact.

As global climate talks continue, the maritime industry must navigate the complexities of international diplomacy and domestic political pressures. The outcome of the COP30 summit in Brazil will be a critical indicator of the international community’s resolve to address maritime emissions in the face of geopolitical challenges.

The IMO’s decision to delay the emissions charge vote raises critical questions about the future of international climate cooperation. How will the maritime industry and global policymakers reconcile economic interests with the urgent need for environmental action in the coming years?

Maritime shipping accounts for around 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions, and are on track to roughly double by 2050 under most economic scenarios.
Shipping emissions are also among the most difficult to address, with a need to develop and implement low emissions fuels, infrastructure and technologies in order to significantly reduce the sector’s climate footprint.
The draft framework included a series of international regulations aimed at reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from ships, including a global fuel standard, and the establishment of a global carbon pricing mechanism.
It requires action and support from the entire shipping ecosystem, including fuel producers, ship owners, regulators, and many more.","The International Maritime Organization (IMO), the 176-member state UN agency responsible for developing global standards for shipping, announced that its member states have voted to delay the adoption of the “IMO Net-Zero Framework,” a global agreement aimed at implementing measures to reduce the climate impact of ocean shipping.

The establishment of the international net zero shipping framework was delayed despite an initial draft receiving majority support in April, following significant pressure from the U.S.’ Trump administration, which had threatened a series of retaliatory actions against nations supporting the agreement.

Maritime shipping accounts for around 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions, and are on track to roughly double by 2050 under most economic scenarios. Shipping emissions are also among the most difficult to address, with a need to develop and implement low emissions fuels, infrastructure and technologies in order to significantly reduce the sector’s climate footprint.

The draft framework included a series of international regulations aimed at reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from ships, including a global fuel standard, and the establishment of a global carbon pricing mechanism.

Under the framework, ships would be required to comply with a new global fuel standard to reduce their annual GHG fuel intensity (GFI) over time, with ships above the GFI thresholds required to balance their emissions deficit by transferring “surplus units” earned by other ships or used surplus units they may have already banked, or to purchase remedial units.

Proceeds from the sale of remedial units would contribute to an IMO Net-Zero Fund, rewarding low-emission ships, supporting innovation, research, infrastructure and just transition initiatives in developing countries, funding technology transfer and capacity building to support the IMO GHG Strategy, and mitigating negative impacts on vulnerable states.

The April framework was approved by 63 nations in April, while the U.S. publicly opposed the agreement and left the negotiations prior to the vote, following which the administration warned of “reciprocal measures” to compensate for any fees under the new framework charged to U.S. ships, and “for any other economic harm from any adopted GHG emissions measures.”

Prior to the beginning of negotiations to adopt the framework last week, the U.S. State Department issued a communication stating that “the Administration unequivocally rejects this proposal before the IMO,” and detailing a series of actions that it would consider on nations supporting the framework, including “considering potential regulations to combat anti-competitive practices from certain flagged countries and potential blocking vessels registered in those countries,” imposing visa restrictions on crews, imposing commercial penalties and additional port fees, and “evaluating sanctions on officials sponsoring activist-driven climate policies that would burden American consumers,” among other potential measures.

A motion to delay the negotiations on the framework by a year put forward by Singapore and tabled for a vote by Saudi Arabia was agreed to by 57 countries, and opposed by 49, with 21 abstaining.

Industry participants expressed disappointment with the delay, citing the uncertainty it will create in their emissions reduction initiatives and investments. In a statement following the announcement, shipping giant Maersk called the decision “a loss of momentum for the shipping industry’s efforts to decarbonize,” and that it now must “await further clarity on the road ahead and on how the IMO intends to continue the work on the Net Zero Framework.”

Maersk added:

“The energy transition of the shipping industry has never been an easy task. It requires action and support from the entire shipping ecosystem, including fuel producers, ship owners, regulators, and many more. Global regulations are a precondition to securing a level playing field in a global industry.”",https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMO-Oct-2025.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 07:19:40.561602

The session will now pause for one year, prolonging uncertainty over how the shipping industry’s transition to zero emissions will be regulated. Following tense and dramatic deliberations, the divided industry has reacted strongly to the development.

Thomas A. Kazakos, Secretary General of the International Chamber of Shipping (ICS), was among the first to respond. He expressed disappointment that Member States had not been able to agree on a way forward at this meeting, emphasizing the need for clarity so the industry can make the investments required to decarbonize in line with the IMO GHG Strategy.

Global Maritime Forum (GMF) Director of Decarbonisation, Jesse Fahnestock, also voiced disappointment, noting that Member States that had decisively agreed on the framework in April were now facing exceptional political barriers to adoption.

“Today’s adjournment is a disappointing setback for shipping, but not the end of this journey. The adjournment for a full year creates serious challenges for meeting the timelines in the Net-Zero Framework agreed in April and will make delivery of the sector’s decarbonisation targets even more challenging.”

…said Fahnestock, while urging the Member States who supported the framework in April to reaffirm their commitment to multilateralism and continue urgently working on guidelines and regulatory measures that align with the IMO’s unanimously agreed Greenhouse Gas Strategy.

The World Shipping Council (WSC) issued a statement acknowledging the difficult and complex nature of the negotiations, while emphasizing the importance of using the year ahead to clarify and develop the IMO Net-Zero Framework:

“The IMO remains the right place to deliver a global solution. We are committed to continuing work with governments to deliver the necessary regulatory consistency, support renewable fuel production and infrastructure, and keep shipping’s energy transition on track.”

…the WSC statement highlights.

Commenting on the outcome, Tim Wilkins, Managing Director of INTERTANKO, saw the delay as an opportunity:

“This gives us time to improve the single regulatory maritime framework to cut maritime emissions. Let’s use this opportunity to work collaboratively to tackle the ambiguities and concerns of the NZF.”

Emma Scheiris, Deputy Director – Environment at INTERTANKO, added that the industry is ready to accelerate progress, highlighting that cooperation is key to forming an improved robust, pragmatic and realistic version of the NZF.

INTERCARGO echoed this sentiment, characterizing the postponement as a potential window for constructive dialogue. The organization emphasized that this time should be used effectively to bridge differing positions among IMO Member States and to ensure that the shipping industry’s input is heard.

“We invite Member States at IMO to work more closely among them but also in partnership with the shipping community towards agreeing on a regulatory framework that is realistic, practical, and globally workable.”

…commented Kostas Gkonis, Secretary General, INTERCARGO.

European Shipowners | ECSA also highlighted that the adoption of the IMO agreement is crucial to deliver on the transition of international shipping to net-zero emissions and to ensure an international level playing field in regulation.

We regret today’s postponement of the adoption of the international climate agreement for shipping. The IMO Net-Zero Framework is essential to give the industry the certainty it needs and to send a strong signal to the market to produce the clean fuels necessary to get to net zero.

…said Sotiris Raptis, Secretary General of European Shipowners | ECSA.

Furthermore, the International Bunkering Industry Association (IBIA) reaffirmed its support for the IMO Net-Zero Framework and expressed disappointment at the outcome, which diverged from the expectations of many international associations.

“IBIA supported the adoption of the NZF and were already engaged in crucial work on the detailed guidelines. Meanwhile, a majority of IMO’s Member States weren’t prepared to move ahead, making shipping the first sector with a global regulatory framework to decarbonise.”

…IBIA highlighted.

The International Association of Ports and Harbors (IAPH) took a firm stance, describing the postponement as a major setback for the global framework needed to drive decarbonisation investments at sea and on land:

“This is a major setback for the maritime industry. Shipping and ports need a global framework that provides them with legal certainty to make the necessary investments in decarbonisation. Only IMO can provide such a framework.”

…said IAPH Managing Director Patrick Verhoeven, who also warned that the delay could lead to more national and regional measures, complicating the regulatory landscape and creating unintended consequences.

The Norwegian Maritime Authority similarly expressed disappointment at the postponement:

“This was not the result we wanted. We have worked for a long time to get this agreement in place, and postponing it now only creates uncertainty. Global problems need global solutions. The climate agreement that was on the table was well-worked and good, and a decision that many have been waiting for.”

…said Bjelland Eriksen, Norway’s Minister of Climate and Environment, who reaffirmed Norway’s commitment to securing a global climate agreement for shipping.

On a similar note, Danish Shipping underlined that geopolitical tensions had derailed the green transition of international shipping. It stressed that the agreement would have had a positive effect on reducing the price gap between fossil and alternative fuels, an essential component of the transition.

“This is not what we came for. We came here to finally conclude a crucial climate agreement for international shipping. We from the Danish side have worked tirelessly towards this for a long time, so it’s a big disappointment.”

…said Danish Shipping’s CEO, Anne H. Steffensen.

Furthermore, the Greek Minister of Shipping and Insular Policy, Vassilis Kikilias remarked that the negotiations were challenging and highlighted serious shortcomings regarding implementation timelines, the unfair treatment of LNG as a fuel and the unjustifiably high penalties on shipping which, if adopted, could have caused significant disruptions to global trade and increases in product prices.

Greece, with its strong maritime tradition, unique expertise, and the world’s most powerful fleet, will seek to play a significant role in these negotiations for the evolving framework.

Talks at the International Maritime Organization (IMO) on adopting new global rules to cut greenhouse gas emissions from ships ended Friday without agreement, as delegates voted to defer a decision for 12 months amid sharp divisions over the proposed Net-Zero Framework.

The IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) decided to adjourn its extraordinary session convened this week in London and reconvene in a year’s time.

Nations meanwhile are expected to continue consultations to bridge differences over the framework, which seeks to align the shipping sector with the global goal of net zero emissions by 2050.

In closing remarks, IMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez urged delegates to use the coming year to rebuild trust and seek consensus.

“Even though you have differences of opinion, you all spoke in support of the work of this Organization,” he said.

“There are no winners and losers in this session. Let us take this moment to learn from it and come back ready to negotiate and take the next steps needed to meet the goals you all agreed to in the 2023 GHG strategy.”

He asked delegates not to celebrate the adjournment. “There are concerns we need to address, let us work with each other,” he said.

A missed opportunity

UN Spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric told reporters in New York that Secretary-General António Guterres viewed the outcome as “a missed opportunity for Member States to place the shipping sector on a clear, credible path towards net-zero emissions.”

He stressed that decarbonizing the maritime sector – responsible for about 80 per cent of global trade – “is critical.”

Media reports cited opposition from several major economies – including the United States – which argued that the proposed global pricing mechanism risked functioning as a “carbon tax” and could raise shipping costs by more than 10 per cent.

Emergency Care Needs to Be Prioritised

Syllabus: Health

Source: TH

Context: The recent stampede in Karur, Tamil Nadu, highlighted gaps in India’s emergency response system, sparking renewed calls to treat emergency medical care not merely as a service, but as a constitutional duty ensuring every citizen’s right to life.

About Emergency Care Needs to Be Prioritised:

Evolution of Emergency Care:

Modern emergency medicine evolved from wartime trauma management during the World Wars, where organised triage and rapid evacuation became critical.

The industrial revolution and advances in trauma and cardiovascular medicine led to structured ambulance systems with life-support capability.

Over time, the focus expanded from mere transport to on-site stabilisation, giving rise to paramedic-led and doctor-led mobile emergency units.

India’s 108 Emergency Response System, introduced under the National Health Mission (NHM), institutionalised public access to emergency transport.

The concept evolved globally into the “Golden Hour” and later the “Platinum Ten Minutes”, emphasising response speed as a determinant of survival.

Constitutional Imperative:

The Right to Life under Article 21 of the Indian Constitution inherently guarantees access to timely emergency medical care.

The State is ethically bound to ensure unobstructed emergency access during mass gatherings and disasters.

Science of Timely Intervention:

Acute illnesses and trauma cause rapid circulatory collapse; immediate diagnosis and treatment can reverse these life-threatening disturbances.

The “Golden Hour” represents the crucial 60 minutes post-injury when intervention can prevent irreversible organ damage.

The evolved “Platinum Ten Minutes” standard stresses that medical help—not just transport—should reach the victim within 10 minutes.

Modern ambulances act as mobile ICUs, equipped with oxygen supply, defibrillators, ECG, airway management tools, and telemedicine links.

Timely, skilled intervention transforms outcomes, reducing preventable deaths from strokes, heart attacks, and trauma.

Existing Initiatives:

The 108 Ambulance Service, a public-private partnership, operates over 10,000 ambulances, serving 7–9 million patients annually.

Tamil Nadu leads with an average response time of 10 minutes 14 seconds, close to the Platinum Ten benchmark.

The National Ambulance Code (AIS-125) sets standards for design, safety, and equipment across vehicle categories.

The Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act, 2019, mandates right of way for ambulances and penalises obstruction.

NHM support enables State-level flexibility in managing emergency systems and training first responders.

Challenges in Emergency Systems:

Fragmented services: Wide disparities exist between States and private providers, leading to uneven quality.

Skill shortage: Lack of certified emergency medical technicians and high attrition rates weaken continuity.

Infrastructure gaps: Many ambulances lack advanced life support systems and telemedicine integration.

Poor coordination: Weak linkages between call centres, hospitals, and ambulance teams delay response.

Accountability vacuum: Absence of a National Emergency Regulatory Authority results in inconsistent standards and oversight.

Policy Reforms and Recommendations:

Constitute a National Emergency Services Regulatory Authority to standardise training, operations, and equipment across States.

Integrate technology through AI-based dispatch systems, GPS tracking, and real-time data sharing with hospitals.

Introduce national certification and pay parity for paramedics to improve retention and professionalism.

Expand air and drone ambulances for remote access and organ transport logistics.

Mandate emergency access protocols for public gatherings and urban infrastructure planning.

Promote PPP models for integrated emergency networks linking urban and rural areas.

Conclusion:

A nation capable of robotic surgeries and organ transplants must not lose lives to delayed ambulances or disorganised response systems. Emergency medical care must evolve from fragmented services into a right-based, standardised national mission. Recognising it as a constitutional and moral duty is essential to ensure that every citizen receives help when every second counts.

Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP)

Source: DH

Context: The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) invoked Stage II of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) across Delhi-NCR as the city’s Air Quality Index (AQI) crossed 300 (“very poor”).

About Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP):

What it is?

The Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) is a statutory framework that specifies stage-wise measures to be implemented to combat deteriorating air quality in the National Capital Region. It provides predefined actions based on the severity of pollution.

Established in: GRAP was first introduced in 2017 under the directives of the Supreme Court of India and the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986.

Later revised by the CAQM in December 2024 to include predictive action based on IMD and IITM forecasts.

Aim: The plan aims to create a graded and preemptive response system for air quality management by identifying specific interventions to be taken as the AQI worsens in Delhi-NCR.

Criteria / Stages: GRAP classifies air quality into four categories based on AQI levels and corresponding actions:

Stage Category AQI Range Actions Stage I Poor 201–300 Dust control, waste removal, enforcement of vehicle norms Stage II Very Poor 301–400 Mechanical sweeping, C&D monitoring, DG set regulations Stage III Severe 401–450 Restrictions on BS-III/IV vehicles, construction limits Stage IV Severe+ Above 450 Ban on truck entry, WFH orders, halting C&D projects

Key Features of GRAP:

Dynamic implementation: Actions are activated dynamically based on real-time AQI data and IMD/IITM forecasts, allowing authorities to respond before pollution peaks.

Cumulative approach: Each higher stage includes all measures from lower stages, ensuring progressive tightening of restrictions as air quality worsens.

Inter-agency coordination: Implementation involves coordinated efforts among CAQM, CPCB, SPCBs, Urban Local Bodies (ULBs), and Traffic Police, ensuring accountability at every level.

Predictive enforcement: Measures are invoked in advance when forecasts show a likely rise in AQI, promoting preventive rather than reactive air quality management.

Green Crackers

Source: IE

Context: As Diwali approaches, discussions around the environmental impact of fireworks have resurfaced, with experts highlighting that green crackers—though less polluting—are not entirely clean.

About Green Crackers:

What it is?

Green crackers are eco-modified firecrackers developed by CSIR–NEERI to reduce emissions of particulate matter, toxic gases, and noise levels compared to conventional fireworks. They aim to provide a safer alternative that maintains festivity while minimizing pollution.

Nauru

Source: DD News

Context: Australia has defended its A$2.5 billion, 30-year agreement with Nauru to resettle deported non-citizens, a move criticised by human rights groups who allege it shifts refugee responsibility to smaller, aid-dependent Pacific nations.

About Nauru:

Country Profile:

Nauru is a micronation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean, recognized as the world’s third-smallest country by land area and population. It functions as a unitary parliamentary republic with a 19-member legislature.

Geographic Location:

Located 25 miles south of the Equator, Nauru lies in southeastern Micronesia, about 800 km northeast of the Solomon Islands and 300 km west of Kiribati’s Banaba Island.

Its land area is only 21 sq. km, making it one of the most compact sovereign states globally.

Administrative Centre: The nation lacks an official capital, but the district of Yaren hosts the Parliament, Presidential offices, and administrative institutions, serving as the de facto capital.

Geological and Environmental Features:

The island is a raised coral atoll with a ring of fertile coastal land encircling Buada Lagoon, its only inland water body.

The interior plateau, elevated about 100 feet above sea level, is rich in phosphate rock derived from ancient bird guano deposits.

Phosphate mining has degraded over 80% of Nauru’s land, creating sharp limestone pinnacles and limiting agriculture.

The island faces severe freshwater scarcity, with rainfall-dependent reservoirs and imported water supplies.

Significance:

Nauru’s economy relies heavily on phosphate exports, Australian aid, and offshore asylum processing revenues.

It remains a key geopolitical partner for Australia, hosting a detention and resettlement facility under a long-term migration and defence cooperation framework.

Despite extensive deliberations and the submission of a finalized draft text, consensus could not be reached among Member States.

MEPC/ES.2 considered adoption of two amendments to MARPOL Annex VI:

The IMO NZF, setting out new requirements on GHG fuel intensity, in combination with a pricing and reward mechanism

Designation of the North-East Atlantic as an ECA for SOx, PM and NOx.

MEPC remained divided throughout the meeting and during the final day, a majority of 57 member states voted to adjourn the meeting for one year, while 49 voted to continue. This means that the amendments were not adopted, and the meeting continues in October 2026. This means that the possible entry into force will be on 1 March 2028 earliest.

Finalization of the IMO Net-Zero Framework

Latest updates to the text

At its extraordinary session, MEPC established a drafting group which made several editorial modifications to text approved at MEPC 83.

Clarification on the relationship between SEEMP and the GFI

Regulation 26 on the Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan SEEMP was amended to clarify that the SEEMP part IV requirements relating to chapter 5 of MARPOL Annex V (the GFI) are only subject to verification while SEEMP requirements relating to the CII (SEEMP part III) are subject to both verification and company audits.

This distinction was made due to conceptual incompatibility between company audits under SEEMP and the GFI framework. Unlike the Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII), the GFI does not require corrective action plans or continuous improvement plans. Instead, the IMO Net Zero Fund assesses ship performance solely on the types of fuel used, and on whether these meet or not the requirements.

The amendments also clarify that SEEMP part II requirements are also subject to verification.

Usage of surplus units

Paragraph 12 of regulation 36 was amended to clarify that Surplus units could be banked and then transferred during subsequent reporting periods. Appendix XIII, which governs the Statement of Compliance was updated to reflect rules pertaining to surplus unit transfers such as recording the year of issue and expiry and adding fields to accommodate the transfer of surplus units between ships. The validity of these surplus units was capped at two years.

Other technical and editorial improvements:

The definition of a “new ship” applicable to chapter V was simplified. Instead of using a three-date criterion like with the EEDI, only the delivery date of the vessel as clearer temporal cut-offs.

The phrase “fuel and/or energy sources” may be amended to simply “fuel,” as the existing definition of fuel is already broad enough to encompass energy sources.

The term “reporting period” was replaced with “calendar year,” thereby enabling new ships to report for “part of the calendar year”.

Provisions related to company changes, transfer, end-of-life reporting duties were also clarified.

The compliance formula was corrected to explicitly include the ×10⁻⁶ conversion factor, ensuring consistent units from grams to tonnes.

The GFI registry is required to also record the energy consumption from each fuel j, and its GHG intensity (EIj).

The “amount of ZNZs used” is required to be reported in energy units (MJ) rather than in CO₂ equivalents.

Proposal for North-East Atlantic Ocean Emission Control Area (ECA)

MEPC 83 approved a proposal to designate the North-East Atlantic Ocean as an Emission Control Area (ECA) for sulphur oxides (SOₓ), nitrogen oxides (NOₓ), and particulate matter (PM).

NOx Tier III requirements for this ECA would have used the same three date criterion used for the Norwegian ECA: meaning it applies to ships with a building contract placed on or after 1 January 2027, or in absence of contract, keel laying on or after 1 July 2027, or which are delivered on or after 1 January 2031.

SOx requirements require the use fuel oil with sulphur content not exceeding 0.10% m/m in the ECA with starting on 1 March 2028.

Amendments relating to multiple engine operational profiles for marine diesel engine

MEPC 83 adopted amendments to the Nox Technical Code 2008 a marine diesel engine, including clarifying engine test cycles. Related amendments to MARPOL Annex VI were considered during this session.

These amendments would have clarified entries in data reporting required by Regulations 27 and 28 relating to multiple engine operational profiles for a marine diesel engine. They include:

updating the definition of “irrational emission control strategy,”;

adding new rows for Tier I, II, and III to indicate Multiple Engine Operational Profiles in Appendix I (IAPP Certificate);

updating the text in Appendix II (Test Cycles and Weighting Factors) to better reflect test cycle details for different types of marine diesel engines, and finally updating test cycle details for different types of marine diesel engines;

updating Appendix IX (Information to Be Submitted to the IMO Ship Fuel Oil) by introducing two sets of fuel reporting dates for ships that undergo a flag change within the year. These changes resolve discrepancies between Regulations 27 (IMO DCS) and 28 (CII) that cause confusion in annual fuel consumption reporting and replace the term “Oil-Fired Boiler(s)” with “Fired Boiler(s)” to ensure that Appendix IX accurately reflects other equipment such as gas-fired boilers.

IMO DCS accessibility

Amendments to MARPOL Annex VI, Regulation 27 were proposed to broaden access to the DCS data thereby increasing transparency. These amendments, meant to become effective 1 March 2027, would have allowed Recognized Organizations acting on behalf of a ship’s Administration to have full access to the DCS database, grant full access (for analytical purposes) to all Parties to MARPOL Annex VI, and provide anonymized data access to public user accounts so that individual ships cannot be identified.

Review of short-term measures

The review clauses of the short-term measures were considered to no longer reference 1 January 2026 as a deadline (as phase 1 of the review was completed) but instead refer to the 2023 IMO GHG Strategy.

Reduction of GHG emissions from ships

Agenda for ISWG-GHG 20

The 20th session of the Intersessional Meeting of the Working Group on Reduction of GHG Emissions from Ships (ISWG-GHG 20) will be held from October 20 to 24, 2025.

The following matters will be discussed during the session:

Development of new and/or revision of existing guidelines, provisions, guidance and other documents, as appropriate, for supporting the uniform and effective implementation of the IMO Net-Zero Framework:

a. Fuel certification

b. ZNZ definition and/or reward

c. IMO Net-Zero Fund

d. GFI and GFI compliance approaches

e. IMO GFI Registry

Further consideration of the development of the IMO Life Cycle GHG Assessment (LCA) framework.

It’s a question that some prominent people are asking this week after the increasingly woke and essentially useless globalist body attempted to sneak a global carbon tax in through the back door while no one was looking.
Under the leadership of POTUS (President Donald Trump), the U.S. will be a hard NO.

This camel’s nose under the tent move by the U.N. to sneak a global carbon tax into reality is just the latest in a long parade of examples that serve as proof points for that thesis.","Has the time come for America to seriously reassess its participation in and support for the United Nations (U.N.)?

It’s a question that some prominent people are asking this week after the increasingly woke and essentially useless globalist body attempted to sneak a global carbon tax in through the back door while no one was looking.

Except someone was looking, as it turns out. Republican Utah Sen. Mike Lee, who chairs the powerful Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and is part of the majority on both the Senate Judiciary and Senate Foreign Relations Committees, said in an X post Thursday evening that this latest bit of anti-American action “warrants our withdrawal from the UN.”

Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in his own X post on the matter on Wednesday that the Trump administration “will not allow the UN to tax American citizens and companies. Under the leadership of POTUS (President Donald Trump), the U.S. will be a hard NO. We call on other nations to stand alongside the United States in defense of our citizens and sovereignty.” (RELATED: Trump Admin Blows Up UN ‘Global Green New Scam’ Tax Push, Forcing Pullback)

On Friday afternoon, Mr. Rubio took to X again to announce the news that efforts by himself and others in the Trump administration succeeded in killing an effort to move the tax forward during a meeting in London. However, the proposal is not fully dead – a final vote on it was simply delayed for a year.

The issue at hand stems from an attempt by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) – an agency of the U.N. – to impose net-zero rules on fuels used for seaborne shipping operations. The Trump administration estimates the imposition of the new requirements will increase the cost of shipping goods by about 10%, thus creating yet another round of inflation hitting the poorest citizens the hardest thanks to the globalist obsession with the amount of plant food – carbon dioxide – in the atmosphere.

Known as the IMO Net-Zero Framework, the proposal claims it would effectively “zero out” emissions from the shipping industry by 2050.

The potential implications if the U.N. ultimately succeeds in implementing its own global carbon tax are obvious. If this unelected, unaccountable globalist body can levy a carbon tax on Americans, a concept that America’s own elected officials have steadfastly rejected across the terms of the last five U.S. presidents, what would then prevent it from imposing other kinds of taxes on the world to support its ideological goals?

President Trump’s opposition to exactly this kind of international intrusion into America’s domestic policy choices is the reason why he has twice won the presidency, each time de-committing the U.S. from the Paris Climate Accords.

It has become increasingly obvious in recent years that the central goal of the global climate alarm movement is to dramatically raise the cost of all kinds of energy in order to force the masses to live smaller, more restricted lives and make their behavior easier for authoritarian governments to control. This camel’s nose under the tent move by the U.N. to sneak a global carbon tax into reality is just the latest in a long parade of examples that serve as proof points for that thesis.

At some point, U.S. officials must seriously reassess the value proposition in continuing to spend billions of dollars each year supporting and hosting a globalist organization whose every action seems designed to inflict damage on our country and its people. Now would be a good time to do that, in fact.

The IMO finalized the draft in April 2025. Its proposed system resembles a cap‑and‑trade model, with carbon charges between $100 and $380 per metric ton on emissions of the life-essential gas carbon dioxide (CO₂). This had the potential to generate $10–12 billion annually for a UN‑administered “green transition grift” fund.

This summer, the U.S. robustly rejected these plans.

Still, the globalist grifters persisted and had planned to take a vote this week to formalize the rules and begin confiscating the dirty carbon dollars for global bureaucrats.

However, President Donald Trump’s band of economic and trade warriors have prevailed for the time being and the IMO has voted to delay for one year a decision on implementing a global maritime climate tax.

A majority of countries at the U.N. shipping agency voted on Friday to postpone by a year a decision on a global carbon price on international shipping, after failing to reach consensus on the emissions reduction measure amid U.S. pressure.

The delay is a blow to the European Union and other countries including Brazil which have been pushing for the shipping industry to go greener and set out a price mechanism for decarbonisation.

Washington and Riyadh, the world’s two largest oil producers, have strongly opposed a carbon price on shipping during talks in London at the International Maritime Organization (IMO).

After days of disagreements, Saudi Arabia tabled a motion on Friday to defer discussions for one year, which was passed by a simple majority of 57 countries with 49 opposed who sought to continue with a deal.

The decision came after President Donald Trump calling this proposal a “scam tax” and and threatened reprisals on countries supporting it.

This is a huge win for the Trump Team, the U.S., and nations who appreciate functional trade networks and affordable prices for their citizens.

U.S. Ambassador to the UN Mike Waltz tweeted: “This is another HUGE win for @POTUS. Thanks to his leadership, the United States prevented a massive UN tax hike on American consumers that would have funded progressive climate pet projects. Our country will continue to lead the way and put America FIRST.”

Secretary of State Marc Rubio echoed the same message, calling it “another HUGE win” and thanking the president’s leadership for preventing what he characterized as “a massive UN tax hike on American consumers.”

This pause will push the adoption vote to the next session in October 2026, and it could risk the deal not coming into force until 2030, even if adopted in a year’s time.

Globalist climate cultists and green-grifters are hardest hit.

The World Shipping Council called it a “carefully balanced regulatory package.” Another industry lobby, the International Chamber of Shipping, backed the measure too. “We are disappointed that member states have not been able to agree a way forward at this meeting,” Thomas A. Kazakos, the International Chamber’s Secretary General said in a statement Friday after the vote. “Industry needs clarity to be able to make the investments needed to decarbonise the maritime sector.”

Ralph Regenvanu, the climate minister of Vanuatu, a small Pacific island nation among the world’s most vulnerable to sea level rise, called it “unacceptable given the urgency we face in light of accelerating climate change.”

The importance of this halt can’t be over-stated. The bureaucrats didn’t expect it, and I assert that after another year of more reliable science that is actually published, more social media of sharing more rational new reports confirming that there is no climate crisis, and continued efforts by the Trump Team to protect our national interests. this deal will die completely at the next vote.

Absolutely none of the maritime experts I interviewed early this week thought the US could pull this off. Zero. Massive amounts of money, NGO influence, diplomatic threat and media manipulation were behind this… and the American media (except

@gCaptain and Fox News) was dead silent.

And yet Trump did it.

“That Trump Truth Social post sent shockwaves through the building,” one UN delegate in London told me. “NOBODY expected it. The Secretary General @IMOSecGen looked like a deer in the headlights this morning.”

It’s beginning to dawn on many people that this framework was a move for the United Nations to collect taxes on a global scale.

This halt is one small win for the U.S., and one large win for humanity.

The vote on Friday set back plans to regulate the shipping industry’s contributions to climate change by at least 12 months, even though the Net Zero Framework (NZF) had already been approved by members of the London-based IMO, a United Nations body, in April.

The decision to formally delay adopting the framework until late next year came a day after President Trump took to his Truth Social platform, saying: “I am outraged that the International Maritime Organization is voting in London this week to pass a global Carbon Tax.”

“The United States will NOT stand for this Global Green New Scam Tax on Shipping,” he said, telling countries to vote against the plan.

Proponents of the plan had gone into a meeting of the U.N.’s International Maritime Organization (IMO) with cautious optimism.
Earlier this year, nations agreed to set steadily increasing emissions-intensity limits on vessels under the IMO’s Net Zero Framework.
Maritime shipping accounted for around 2.5 percent of IKEA’s value-chain emissions in 2024, for instance.
“We are in a very early part of a transition, and more than 99% of maritime transport is still powered by fossil fuels,” said Jesse Fahnestock, director of decarbonization at the Global Maritime Forum, a non-profit that partners with shipping companies.","The global effort to decarbonize maritime shipping and reduce value-chain emissions stalled this week after intense lobbying from the U.S. forced negotiators to delay a decision on a net-zero plan for the industry.

Proponents of the plan had gone into a meeting of the U.N.’s International Maritime Organization (IMO) with cautious optimism. Earlier this year, nations agreed to set steadily increasing emissions-intensity limits on vessels under the IMO’s Net Zero Framework. Owners of large vessels would have been required to cut emissions by as much as 43 percent by 2035, compared to a 2008 baseline. The framework was hailed as the first time an industry would be so regulated at a global level.

The IMO meeting was expected to adopt the plan then move to implementation, but support drained away after the U.S. threatened to impose tariffs, visa restrictions and port levies on countries that backed the plan. On Friday, the nations voted to postpone a decision for a year.

‘Unprecedented effort’

“During the past three days, an unprecedented U.S.-led effort to block a global agreement has culminated in multiple spontaneous proposals, and intense pressure both on and out of the floor,” said Alison Shaw, IMO manager at Transport & Environment, a nonprofit with offices in multiple European countries. “It is a clear effort to enact climate denialism, undo years of constructive negotiation and abandon the very targets the IMO has set for itself.”

The decision will slow efforts by companies to reduce shipping emissions, which form a significant part of Scope 3 inventories, particularly for retailers and consumer packaged goods businesses. Maritime shipping accounted for around 2.5 percent of IKEA’s value-chain emissions in 2024, for instance. The company is aiming to purchase only zero-emissions ocean transport services by 2040.

“This is a loss of momentum for the shipping industry’s efforts to decarbonize,” said a spokesperson for Maersk, which operates more than 700 container vessels on routes between 130 countries.

Currently, companies intent on tackling these emissions rely on a patchwork of initiatives including Katalist, a “book and claim” platform that allows them to support and take credit for purchases of low-carbon maritime fuels, such as ammonia and methanol. Members include Amazon, IKEA, Levi Strauss, Mondelez International and Patagonia.

That project and others continue, but spread of the new technologies will be far slower in the absence of the rules the framework would have imposed.

“We are in a very early part of a transition, and more than 99% of maritime transport is still powered by fossil fuels,” said Jesse Fahnestock, director of decarbonization at the Global Maritime Forum, a non-profit that partners with shipping companies. “So to get alternative fuels and the vessels that can use them out there, the regulatory framework is a hugely important lever.”

Talks continue

Despite the pressure from the U.S. and others, nations agreed to delay rather than scrap the framework altogether. Fahnestock noted that because the proposal is still live, discussions about the details of implementation scheduled over the next 12 months may continue as planned.

“Our impression is that the how of the framework is going to continue,” he said. Talks will focus on which fuels qualify as lower-carbon, rules for life-cycle analysis of the fuels and how proceeds credits, which vessel owners can use to meet missed targets, will be distributed.

Still, standing in the way of an agreement is the world’s largest economy. In a joint statement issued last week, U.S. secretaries for state, energy and transportation said they were considering sanctions against officials from countries that support the IMO framework and blocking vessels registered in those countries from U.S. ports.",https://trellis.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Shutterstock-Image-2600765743-e1760735137801.jpg,N,,2025-10-18 18:56:10.877509

To encourage shippers in this vital endeavor, the UN wants the IMO to slap a ""carbon tax"" on the industry. This tax would not reduce greenhouse gas emissions by one single molecule. But hey! It's a ""global emergency"" after all, and everyone has to do their part, right?

Where is all that money from the carbon tax going? To new technology to scrub the atmosphere? If only. Instead, the proceeds from the tax will go to ""developing"" (""poor"") nations to help them deal with bad weather.

In other words, it's just another idea to transfer massive amounts of cash to countries that don't have it. This global equity scheme has been part of the UN climate agenda since the beginning.

Donald Trump and the U.S. were having none of it.

Christiaan De Beukelaer, a senior lecturer in culture and climate at an Australian university, said “It would have marked the first-ever — and legally binding — carbon tax. This explains why petro-states including the United States tried so hard to scuttle the framework.""

A State Department official told CNN, “Now we have a President who will always lead in putting America first and even worked to prevent consumers from around the world from paying higher prices as well.”

Fox News:

Administration officials argue the framework would give unelected international bureaucrats the power to tax U.S. companies and consumers while doing little to cut global emissions.

""This week, the UN is attempting to pass the first global carbon tax, which will increase energy, food, and fuel costs across the world. We will not allow the UN to tax American citizens and companies,"" Rubio wrote on X.

""This is a bigger deal than I think anybody realizes,"" U.N. Ambassador Mike Waltz said on Fox News.

Supporters counter that a uniform carbon price is the only way to push the shipping industry — responsible for nearly 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions — to meet net-zero targets by mid-century.

The U.S. pulled out all the stops to beat back this effort to tax the 90% of goods in the world that are shipped overseas. It was always nothing more than what the climate lobby thought would be, an easy smash and grab, transferring trillions of dollars from rich nations to poor nations in order to fund the poor nation's switch to clean energy.

How much of that cash would have ended up in the pockets of the kleptocrats running those benighted nations was never mentioned.

Trump threatened to retaliate against any nation that voted for the carbon tax on shipping. Some of those retaliatory measures, listed in the State Department press release, show that the U.S. was deadly serious about the tax.

Freight Waves:

In the U.S. statement, retaliatory measures against nations voting for the plan could include:

Blocking vessels from U.S. ports;

Probes and possible regulations over those nations’ anti-competitive practices;

Visa restrictions for vessel crews;

Penalties covering U.S. government contracts for new commercial ships and liquified natural gas terminals;

Additional port fees on ships owned, operated, or flagged by those countries;

Sanctions on officials sponsoring activist-driven climate policies.

“The United States will be moving to levy these remedies against nations that sponsor this European-led neocolonial export of global climate regulations. We will fight hard to protect our economic interests by imposing costs on countries if they support the NZF. Our fellow IMO members should be on notice.”

Other oil-producing nations also opposed the tax, as did China and India. We'll have to go through the whole ordeal again next year when the IMO has its annual meeting and the fight to adopt a global carbon tax on shipping will resume.

The world’s largest maritime nations had been deliberating on regulations to move the shipping industry away from fossil fuels. But U.S. President Donald Trump, Saudi Arabia and other countries vowed to fight any global tax on shipping emissions.

On Thursday, Trump urged countries to vote “No” on the regulations. The International Maritime Organization adjourned its meeting Friday.

THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below.

The world’s largest maritime nations were deliberating Friday on regulations that would move the shipping industry away from fossil fuels to slash emissions as U.S. President Donald Trump and others vowed to fight any global tax on shipping emissions.

On Thursday, United States President Donald Trump posted on his social media platform Truth Social asking countries to vote “No” and that “The United States will not stand for this global green new scam tax on shipping.”

Representatives from the U.S., Saudi Arabia, Russia and a host of other nations are against the regulations passing through in its current form. The meetings on Friday witnessed a tense start as they continued their discussions from earlier in the week about meeting procedures.

“I put myself out there to try and find a way for you to cooperate and move forward in the normal way that we would,” said Arsenio Dominguez, secretary general of the International Maritime Organization. During his statement, Dominguez added that the way negotiations have happened this week should not be repeated again.

The top shipping nations from across the world are meeting at the International Maritime Organization headquarters in London. If the green shipping regulations are adopted, this will be the first time a global fee is imposed on planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions. Most ships today run on heavy fuel oil that releases carbon dioxide and other pollutants as it’s burned.

Shipping emissions have grown over the past decade to about 3% of the global total as trade has grown and vessels use immense amounts of fossil fuels to transport cargo over long distances. In April, IMO member states agreed on the contents of the regulatory framework, with the aim of adopting the “Net-Zero Framework” at this London meeting.

“The attempts from the U.S. and others to delay the adoption of the IMO’s Net-Zero Framework are an affront to multilateralism and fly in the face of the the courage and ambition shown by member states when it was agreed in April. Thankfully this is not a foregone conclusion and countries can continue to demonstrate the spirit of solidarity that they showed in April when voting to adopt the framework,” said Emma Fenton, senior director for climate diplomacy at a U.K.-based climate change nonprofit, Opportunity Green.

The regulations set a marine fuel standard that decreases, over time, the amount of greenhouse gas emissions allowed from using shipping fuels. The regulations also establish a pricing system that would impose fees for every ton of greenhouse gases emitted by ships above allowable limits, in what is effectively the first global tax on greenhouse gas emissions.

The IMO, which regulates international shipping, set a target for the sector to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by about 2050, and has committed to ensuring that fuels with zero or near-zero emissions are used more widely.

Observers said it is still unclear what will be decided later today.

“By voting for adoption of the framework, governments will make history with the first global carbon price, and set course for reducing shipping’s global impact on the climate,” said John Maggs, the Clean Shipping Coalition’s representative at the IMO. “But failing to support the framework will be a missed opportunity, and risks stagnating action at the IMO for years to come.”",https://www.abccolumbia.com/content/uploads/2025/10/x/j/ap25286586888279-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-18 15:56:11.108675

The IMO’s net-zero proposal, agreed in principle by a majority of member states in April, requires ships with a volume exceeding 5,000 gross tonnes to progressively reduce their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions intensity — measured as emissions per unit of fuel — by 30% by 2035 and 65% by 2040, compared to 2008 levels.

Vessels that fail to meet the stricter benchmark would face a $100-per-tonne fee from 2028, while those that fall short of a less demanding target would be charged up to $380 per tonne.

The proposal further sought to establish a carbon credit market, allowing the owners or operators of more efficient vessels to sell credits to those with higher emissions.

After tense negotiations this week, Saudi Arabia tabled a motion on Friday to defer discussions for one year, which was passed by a simple majority of 57 countries to 49. A further 70 nations, including Japan and Greece, abstained from voting.

The Saudi motion was backed by nations including the US, the UAE and China. US President Donald Trump called the levy “a green new tax scam”.

Trump’s administration has previously stated that it would retaliate if any global carbon levy is applied to its ships.

“While the delay provides additional time to build consensus—also within different shipping segments—momentum appears to be fading, making agreement increasingly difficult,” said ING’s senior economist for transport and logistics, Rico Luman.

“Continued procrastination could ultimately lead to cancellation, which would be a disappointing outcome.

The decision was made on Friday, 17 October 2025, during an extraordinary session of the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC), which was convened from 14 to 17 October in London to consider draft amendments to MARPOL Annex VI.

The proposal to delay was put forward by Saudi Arabia and supported by Singapore. It passed by a simple majority, with 57 countries voting in favour of the delay, 49 opposing it, and 21 abstaining.

The decision is seen as a setback for countries such as the European Union, Brazil, India, China, Japan, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the Republic of Korea, which had supported the immediate adoption of the framework. These countries viewed it as a key step towards reducing emissions from global shipping.

In contrast, the United States and Saudi Arabia led efforts to oppose the move, arguing that the measure would place an unfair financial burden on global trade. Both countries are among the world’s largest oil producers.

According to several delegates, Washington exerted diplomatic and economic pressure on other states ahead of the vote. Per reports, the Trump administration had threatened to impose tariffs and sanctions on countries supporting the framework, particularly developing and climate-vulnerable nations. Some representatives described this as “bullying”, “unprecedented”, and “undiplomatic”.

U.S. President Donald Trump had publicly urged IMO member states to reject the carbon pricing proposal, calling it a “global green new scam tax on shipping”. He stated on Truth Social that the United States would not comply with such a measure “in any way, shape or form”.

The Net-Zero Framework (NZF) was approved in principle at MEPC 83 in April 2025 as a new Chapter 5 of the Draft Revised Annex VI of the MARPOL Convention. It sets international regulations to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from ships complying with the IMO’s 2023 GHG reduction strategy.

The framework was initially scheduled to enter into force by March 2027. However, that timeline will now need to be reviewed following the one-year postponement.

During the session, the United States and Saudi Arabia also proposed changing the IMO’s usual “consensus” adoption procedure to an “explicit” process, which would add extra procedural steps and make it harder for some developing countries to adopt the framework later.

Environmental groups expressed concern over the outcome. Faig Abbasov, shipping director at Transport & Environment, said the delay leaves the maritime sector “adrift in uncertainty”.

IMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez, in his closing remarks, cautioned delegates not to see the result as a success, saying there were still issues that needed to be addressed before final approval.

Although the extraordinary session has been adjourned for one year, technical work on implementing the framework will continue. The Intersessional Working Group on the Reduction of Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Ships (ISWG-GHG-20) will meet from 20 to 24 October 2025 to work on guidelines for implementing the framework, including incentive schemes and revenue distribution.

The IMO confirmed that the MEPC will meet again in 12 months to reconsider the proposal and seek wider agreement among its 176 member states.

Global shipping contributes nearly 3% of global CO₂ emissions and handles about 90% of world trade. Without a clear emissions plan, experts warn that pollution from the sector could continue to rise.

Sanctions Warning Sparks Reversal

Trump posted on Truth Social that he opposed what he called a ""Global Green New Scam Tax on Shipping,"" vowing the United States would not tolerate it.

Washington later warned it might impose penalties, visa restrictions and port charges on countries voting for the plan.

Before the intervention, roughly 60 nations were expected to reaffirm support for the measure. However, delegates instead voted 57–49 to postpone formal adoption, extending negotiations into late next year.

Environmental Targets Set Back

The Net Zero Framework aimed to impose a $380-per-tonne charge on excess emissions while rewarding vessels that used cleaner alternatives.

It aimed to guide the shipping industry toward a 20% emissions cut by 2030. The framework also targeted net zero by 2050.

The International Chamber of Shipping said the delay undermines long-term investment decisions.

Secretary-General Thomas Kazakos said the industry needs clarity to make the commitments required to decarbonize.

Several major economies, including China, the European Union, Brazil, and Britain, reaffirmed their support before the vote. This came despite strong objections from Russia and Saudi Arabia.

Yet Argentina and Singapore, both previous supporters, joined the call to defer the measure this time.

Growing Climate Pressure

Shipping, which accounts for nearly three percent of global emissions, is under growing pressure to adopt cleaner energy sources. Alternatives like ammonia and methanol are being explored to replace traditional bunker fuel.

Climate experts warn that the delay could hinder new technological investments in the sector.

They say extreme weather is already disrupting sea routes and endangering maritime safety worldwide.

The Trump administration is looking to take a bigger role in global shipping, and has previously used tariffs as a weapon to extract better terms from Washington’s trade partners

SHIPPING INDUSTRY REACTION

The maritime sector had been expecting a regulatory framework to de-risk and unlock investment in alternative fuels and modern ships.

Danish shipping company Maersk (MAERSKb.CO) said the IMO’s decision was a loss of momentum for the industry’s efforts to decarbonise, adding that it will wait to see how the organisation intends to continue the work on the framework.

“The delay leaves the shipping sector drifting in uncertainty,” said Faig Abbasov, director of shipping with environmental group Transport & Environment.

Climate Impact The plan’s failure is another example of the challenges that international climate diplomacy and regulation face.","The world’s shipping regulator postponed a decision on adopting a landmark charge on vessel emissions, a shock move that highlights the Trump administration’s efforts to disrupt international climate diplomacy.

The postponement marks a setback for multilateral environmental regulations ahead of next month’s COP30 climate summit in Brazil.

Countries gathered at the International Maritime Organization’s London headquarters this week to decide on whether to make ships start paying for the more than 1 billion tons of greenhouse gases they emit each year. On Friday, they voted to push back that ballot for a year, following a proposal put forward by Saudi Arabia.

Industry insiders had previously expected the rules to pass, despite US pressure. They’ve been years in the making, and would be the world’s first global, fixed charge on emissions for any industry — designed to initially potentially raise over $10 billion a year. They would also pave the way for the end of oil as shipping’s dominant fuel and open the door for cleaner alternatives like ammonia.

While the plan had clear international support back in April, that wavered this week as the US dialed up pressure, threatening wide-ranging measures against those who backed the planned rules that President Donald Trump on Thursday said he was “outraged” about.

The European Union, which already incorporated shipping in its carbon market and wants to lead the global effort to put a price on emissions, wasn’t able to muster enough support to push through the tax.

“The decision to reschedule the vote clearly shows European leadership in international climate talks is not enough,” said Poland’s deputy climate minister, Krzysztof Bolesta. “We need others to cooperate and there are not enough of them around.”

The International Chamber of Shipping, representing over 80% of the world’s fleet, said it was disappointed with the result, and that uncertainty over the plan’s future threatens investments needed to make the sector cleaner.

“The IMO’s failure to adopt the framework this week marks a failure of this United Nations agency to act decisively on climate change,” said Ralph Regenvanu, Vanuatu’s minister for climate change.

US Pressure

The decision’s delay demonstrates the effect that pressure from the Trump administration can have. The US strongly opposed the ship emissions charges, calling them a “global carbon tax” on Americans and warning of “disastrous” economic impacts. It had urged other nations to reject the regulations from “an unaccountable UN organization,” saying some estimates had forecast shipping costs to jump as much as 10% or more.

The State Department had said it would consider measures such as port levies, visa restrictions, commercial penalties and sanctions on officials. It also previously mentioned tariffs as part of potential responses, though it became unclear if they remained on the table.

Trump said the US wouldn’t adhere to the carbon tax “in any way, shape, or form,” and that he was “outraged” that the IMO was holding a vote.

“Stopping this disastrous vote is a massive win for the American people and countries around the world,” said White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers.

The US also put pressure on the plans this week by asking for another step in adopting the charge if countries voted in favor of it — proposing nations explicitly opt in after the vote in a shift from a “tacit acceptance” process. That would effectively add a further hurdle for them coming into force.

There were signs of wavering this week. Bloomberg reported Thursday that Athens, which had long been skeptical about the plan because of the impact on its maritime industry, was considering abstaining.

On Friday, Singapore — previously a supporter of the plan — proposed that nations delay voting on the charge. That was backed by Saudi Arabia, which was already against the rule.

Tensions between countries grew as the week progressed, and by Friday it became increasingly clear that a vote on adopting the levy was in serious doubt. China, Greece, India and Panama — who all backed the plans in April — either voted to delay the decision, or abstained.

Still, the vote for a one-year delay doesn’t necessarily reflect how a ballot on adopting the charge may have gone, because more countries were allowed to have their say on the delay than would have been on the actual tax.

Climate Impact

The plan’s failure is another example of the challenges that international climate diplomacy and regulation face. The Trump administration has been dismantling its domestic climate policy and attempting to disrupt efforts to cut emissions globally. Companies have also ditched climate commitments over the past year as the reality of meeting ambitious time frames becomes clear and the marketing benefits of having green credentials fade.

Though Trump has pulled the US out of the Paris climate agreement, the withdrawal only takes formal effect in 2026. In practice, the US will still be able to block efforts to reach consensus at the COP30 talks in November.

The maritime industry accounts for over four-fifths of the world’s trade and more than 1% of all emissions, and the carbon levy was a key part of the IMO’s push for international shipping to reach net zero by around mid-century.

That goal now looks more difficult to achieve.

“We are disappointed that member states have not been able to agree a way forward at this meeting,” International Chamber of Shipping Secretary General Thomas Kazakos said in a statement. “Industry needs clarity to be able to make the investments needed to decarbonize the maritime sector, in line with the goals set out in the IMO GHG strategy.”

(MENAFN) The United Nations sharply criticized the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) recent decision to delay a critical vote aimed at reducing emissions from the shipping industry, calling it a “missed opportunity” to advance climate action.

At a Friday press briefing, UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric stressed the urgency of the issue, stating, ""It's a missed opportunity for member states to place the shipping sector on a clear and credible path towards net-zero emissions."" He emphasized the sector’s significant environmental impact, noting, ""The shipping sector, central to our global economy, is responsible for about 3% of global emissions."" He added, ""So, the decarbonization of that sector is critical.""

Pressed on reports that US President Donald Trump threatened sanctions against countries backing net-zero emission goals, Dujarric responded, ""We've seen reports, this decision to postpone, not to take action, it's not the end of the road, but obviously, the ball has been kicked down the field, quite a bit."" He underlined that the postponement came ""after deliberations"" by IMO member states.

The IMO, a UN agency responsible for global maritime transport regulations, was expected to vote Friday on the Net-Zero Framework (NZF), a pivotal policy designed to introduce an international levy on shipping emissions. This carbon tax aims to curb shipping’s contribution to global warming, a mounting threat to human life and the planet.

The vote delay followed concerted lobbying by the Trump administration, which pressured countries to resist the emissions-cutting initiative, ultimately stalling progress on this vital climate measure.

There was a similar message from independent tanker owner represented by Intertanko with Managing Director Tim Wilkins saying, “This gives us time to improve the single regulatory maritime framework to cut maritime emissions.
It is point made from Rico Luman, Senior Economist, Transport & Logistics, at ING, “The delay in the final vote to adopt the Net-Zero Framework (NZF) reduces the likelihood of passing the previously agreed proposal.
Can real progress be made over the next 12 months or will positions just become more entrenched in a highly charged geopolitical environment?
The NZF is still alive, but it could just be a case of flogging a dead horse.","Delaying the adoption of the IMO’s Net Zero Framework has kept it alive, but the question is what will have changed in a year’s time when it comes up for another vote.

During a media briefing following the decision by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) member states to delay the adoption of the Net Zero Framework (NZF) Secretary General Arsenio Dominguez was asked whether it was still alive? To which he replied, “It’s very much still alive”.

Certainly, the delaying a vote on whether or not to adopt NZF by another 12 months saved it from the increasingly likely possibility of being voted against at the end of the fractious four-day extraordinary meeting of the MEPC. However, what there is stop the same scenario being played out in a years’ time, just with even more entrenched opinions, is far from clear.

The NZF amendment to MARPOL was approved at the first extraordinary meeting of the MEPC will remain the same and voting on it has simply been adjourned for a year.

On the positive side as the Secretary General pointed out during the briefing the “silver lining” was, “The framework is still there, and the member states are still talking to each other.”

Asked if the delegations would not simply come back in a years’ time still divided Dominguez said, “I’m working on the objective that yes, there is a division, it was clear on the vote today that the there is more work that needs to be done. I think the negotiations between now and the next meeting will actually help address all that in order to start finding those common areas for us to make progress.”

Intersessional workgroup meetings start next week to work on the guidance to the framework that needs to be developed.

Some organisations representing the shipping industry do see the coming 12 months as a window in which the UN body can work through the difficulties the framework faces and find agreement.

The World Shipping Council (WSC), which represents global liner shipping said the IMO should use additional year to close remaining gaps and ensure an effective global agreement.

There was a similar message from independent tanker owner represented by Intertanko with Managing Director Tim Wilkins saying, “This gives us time to improve the single regulatory maritime framework to cut maritime emissions. Let’s use this opportunity to work collaboratively to tackle the ambiguities and concerns of the NZF raised by Intertanko members.”

Interntanko said that it would be present at the intersessional workgroup meetings in the coming week to voice the opinions of its members.

However, representative body also noted it was “unclear what the path forward is since the positions are more polarised”.

There has been considerable talk about the pressure applied by the US on smaller member states to not support the NZF which has been described as “bullying”, “unprecedented”, and “undiplomatic”. With US President Donald Trump expressing his “outrage” over the idea of the framework and global carbon tax on shipping this week, there can be little doubt this pressure will continue over the next 12 months, and quite possibly be ramped up.

It is point made from Rico Luman, Senior Economist, Transport & Logistics, at ING, “The delay in the final vote to adopt the Net-Zero Framework (NZF) reduces the likelihood of passing the previously agreed proposal. It is likely to strengthen opposition, including from the United States, which may view the postponement as a win.”

Indeed, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, took social media platform X to hail it as a “HUGE win” for President Trump. “Thanks to his leadership, the United States prevented a massive UN tax hike on American consumers that would have funded progressive climate pet projects.”

ING’s Luman believes that time is running out for the NZF. “While the delay provides additional time to build consensus—also within different shipping segments—momentum appears to be fading, making agreement increasingly difficult. Continued procrastination could ultimately lead to cancellation, which would be a disappointing outcome,” he said.

The London-based International Maritime Organization (IMO), a United Nations body that governs shipping, voted in April for a global pricing system to help curb greenhouse gases.

But a vote Friday on whether to formally approve the deal was delayed until next year after US President Donald Trump threatened sanctions against countries backing the plan.

Increased divisions, notably between oil-producing nations and non-oil producers, emerged this week at meetings leading up to Friday’s vote.

Delegates instead voted on a hastily arranged resolution to postpone proceedings, which passed by 57 votes to 49.

Trump had said Thursday that the proposed global carbon tax on shipping was a ‘scam’, after the United States withdrew from IMO negotiations in April.

A Russian delegate described the proceedings as ‘chaos’ as he addressed the plenary Friday after talks had lasted into the early hours.

Russia had joined major oil producers Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in voting against the carbon-reduction measure in April, saying it would harm the economy and food security.

IMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez, representing 176 member states, said Friday that he hoped there would be no repeat of how the week’s discussions had gone.

‘It doesn’t help your organisation, it doesn’t help yourself,’ he told delegates.

A European Union source told AFP that ‘many countries have changed their minds under pressure from the United States.

A spokesman for UN chief Antonio Guterres called it ‘a missed opportunity for member states to place the shipping sector on a clear, credible path towards net zero emissions’.

The International Chamber of Shipping, representing more than 80 percent of the world’s fleet, also expressed disappointment.

‘Industry needs clarity to be able to make the investments needed to decarbonise the maritime sector,’ its Secretary General Thomas Kazakos said in a statement.

Since returning to power in January, Trump has reversed Washington’s course on climate change and encouraged fossil fuel use by deregulation.

‘I am outraged that the International Maritime Organization is voting in London this week to pass a global Carbon Tax,’ Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform Thursday.

‘The United States will NOT stand for this Global Green New Scam Tax on Shipping,’ he added, telling countries to vote against it.

Washington threatened to impose sanctions, visa restrictions and port levies on those supporting the Net Zero Framework (NZF), the first global carbon-pricing system.

Major oil-producer Saudi Arabia also called for Friday’s vote to be postponed.

‘We agree with the United States that it’s important that these conversations are brought to light,’ a Saudi representative said.

Ahead of this week’s London gathering, a majority 63 IMO members that in April voted for the plan had been expected to maintain their support and to be joined by others to formally approve the NZF.

Argentina, which in April abstained from the vote, now opposes the deal.

Leading up to Friday’s decision, China, the EU, Brazil, Britain and several other members of the IMO reaffirmed their support.

The NZF requires ships to progressively reduce carbon emissions from 2028 or face financial penalties.

Shipping accounts for nearly three percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, according to the IMO.

The plan would charge ships for emissions exceeding a certain threshold, with proceeds used to reward low-emission vessels and support countries vulnerable to climate change.

If the global emissions pricing system were adopted, it would become difficult to evade, even for the United States.

IMO conventions allow signatories to inspect foreign ships during stopovers and even detain non-compliant vessels.",https://outspoken.newagebd.com/files/img/202510/bcfddf41fd54b0eedbc071ee24e29ff5_og.jpg,N,,2025-10-18 18:56:18.733876

Earlier this year, amid much fanfare, the world's largest maritime nations agreed on the regulations, which would impose a fee on carbon pollution to clean up shipping. The next step of the process -- adopting the regulations -- during the International Maritime Organization meeting in London this week was widely expected to be a formality.

Instead, after much pressure from Trump, along with Saudi Arabia and a handful of other countries, delegates decided to postpone the decision by a year and adjourn. In the interim, nations will continue to negotiate and work toward consensus.

The development underscored how the influence of Trump, who recently called climate change a ""con job,"" extends globally to policies aimed at combating climate change.

""Faced with pressure, too many governments chose political compromise over climate justice, and in doing so, abandoned the countries bearing the brunt of the climate crisis,"" said Emma Fenton, senior director for climate diplomacy at a U.K.-based climate change nonprofit, Opportunity Green.

Trump administration quick to celebrate

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio hailed the development as ""another huge win"" for Trump.

""Thanks to his leadership, the United States prevented a massive U.N. tax hike on American consumers that would have funded progressive climate pet projects,"" Rubio wrote on X. ""Our country will continue to lead the way and put America FIRST.""

Trump had urged countries to vote ""No,"" posting on his social media platform Truth Social on Thursday that ""the United States will not stand for this global green new scam tax on shipping."" The U.S. had threatened to retaliate with tariffs, visa restrictions and port levies if nations supported it.

After vowing to fight any global tax on shipping emissions, Saudi Arabia called for a vote to adjourn the meeting for a year. More than half the countries agreed.

Arsenio Dominguez, secretary-general of the IMO, the United Nations agency that regulates international shipping, said in a post-meeting news conference that ""geopolitics in the world right now makes it more difficult for us to make progress in certain topics.""

Nations falter in efforts to save the planet

The decision, or lack thereof, in London is similar to what happened this summer with a major treaty to end growing plastic pollution around the world. The negotiations fell apart, with the United States and Saudi Arabia opposing any limit on plastic production.

The world's biggest climate summit, COP30, is in November in Belem, Brazil. Ralph Regenvanu, minister for climate change for the Pacific Island nation of Vanuatu, said the road to Belem and beyond is now more difficult.

""The IMO's failure to adopt the framework this week marks a failure of this United Nations agency to act decisively on climate change,"" Regenvanu said. ""But we know that we have international law on our side and will continue to fight for our people and the planet.""

Shipping emissions grow

Large ships last about 25 years, so the industry would need to make changes and investments now to slash its emissions. Most ships today run on heavy fuel oil that releases carbon dioxide and other pollutants as it's burned. The International Chamber of Shipping, which represents more than 80 percent of the world's merchant fleet, advocated for the adoption of the regulations.

Thomas Kazakos, the chamber's secretary-general, said they are disappointed because the industry needs clarity to be able to make the investments needed to decarbonize the maritime sector.

Shipping emissions have grown over the past decade to about 3 percent of the global total as trade has grown and vessels use immense amounts of fossil fuels to transport cargo over long distances.

The regulations, or ""Net-Zero Framework,"" would set a marine fuel standard that decreases, over time, the amount of greenhouse gas emissions allowed from using shipping fuels. The regulations also would establish a pricing system that would impose fees for every ton of greenhouse gases emitted by ships above allowable limits, in what is effectively the first global tax on greenhouse gas emissions.

""The delay leaves the shipping sector drifting in uncertainty. But this week has also shown that there is a clear desire to clean up the shipping industry, even in the face of U.S. bullying,"" said Alison Shaw, IMO Manager at Transport & Environment, a Brussels-based environmental nongovernmental organization.

The IMO set a target for the sector to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by about 2050, and has committed to ensuring that fuels with zero or near-zero emissions are used more widely.

""What matters now is that countries rise up and come back to the IMO with a louder and more confident yes vote that cannot be silenced,"" said Anaïs Rios, shipping policy officer for Seas At Risk. ""The planet and the future of shipping does not have time to waste.""",https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/imports/adg/img/2025/10/18/211317446_211317446-f9d919a8a4fa42fc8dafa859b1f41323_t1200.jpg?57a0c2296240c280e9492005c3cad63e7cbe80f4,N,,2025-10-18 13:56:11.460885

U.S. threats

While countries such as Saudi Arabia and Russia have been opposed to the framework, the United States administration since then continues to issue explicit threats against countries that had supported the framework.

Ahead of the vote on October 17, in London, U.S. President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social, “I am outraged that the International Maritime Organization is voting in London this week to pass a global Carbon Tax. The United States will NOT stand for this Global Green New Scam Tax on Shipping, and will not adhere to it in any way, shape, or form. We will not tolerate increased prices on American Consumers OR, the creation of a Green New Scam Bureaucracy to spend YOUR money on their Green dreams.

Ultimately, Singapore brought in a proposal to delay a decision on the matter for a year and Saudi Arabia proposed a vote. This resulted in 57 countries voting in favour of delay; 49 countries against it and 21 abstentions. The Hindu could not confirm which way India voted.

“We regret that IMO members followed Singapore’s initial proposal to delay the adoption of the framework by 12 months, which Saudi Arabia called to a vote. This is unacceptable given the urgency we face in light of accelerating climate change,” Ralph Regenvanu, Minister for Climate Change, Republic of Vanuatu, who was present at the meeting, said in a statement.

But we know that we have international law on our side and will continue to fight for our people and the planet,” he added.

Shipping emissions

The 2023 IMO GHG (greenhouse gas) Strategy — the umbrella framework — envisages, in particular, a minimum 40% reduction in carbon intensity of international shipping (to reduce CO2 emissions per transport work) by 2030. The Strategy also envisions large-scale adoption of zero or ‘near-zero’ GHG emission technologies, fuels and/or energy sources which are to represent at least 5%, striving for 10%, of the energy used by international shipping by 2030.",https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/45e6m1/article70179488.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/CCI_UDHindu_KSL_U957ON4BN_R1599998059_8_14e680a4-0975-43e9-a253-8bc200dd305e.jpg,N,,2025-10-18 13:56:14.600837

Opening the session, IMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez acknowledged the challenges of balancing climate ambition with economic feasibility. He noted that some member states favored steeper emissions reductions, while others warned that stringent targets could overburden developing countries or increase operational costs. Dominguez described the Net-Zero Framework as a “balanced basis” for future work prior to its planned entry into force in 2027, emphasizing that prolonged indecision could prompt a patchwork of regional and national climate measures, increasing costs and inefficiency for the global shipping industry.

Dominguez also stressed the importance of diplomacy and consensus in IMO’s decision-making process. “Here, we are diplomatic and respectful to one another, we listen to everyone’s opinion, we take steps forward, and we are always looking to improve,” he said, urging member states to continue negotiations and provide clarity for the maritime sector.

The London-based International Maritime Organization (IMO), a United Nations body that governs shipping, voted in April for a global pricing system to help curb greenhouse gases.

But a vote Friday on whether to formally approve the deal was delayed until next year after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened sanctions against countries backing the plan.

Increased divisions, notably between oil-producing nations and non-oil producers, emerged this week at meetings leading up to Friday's vote.

Delegates instead voted on a hastily arranged resolution to postpone proceedings, which passed by 57 votes to 49.

Trump had said Thursday that the proposed global carbon tax on shipping was a ""scam,"" after the United States withdrew from IMO negotiations in April.

A Russian delegate described the proceedings as ""chaos"" as he addressed the plenary Friday after talks had lasted into the early hours.

Russia had joined major oil producers Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in voting against the carbon-reduction measure in April, saying it would harm the economy and food security.

IMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez, representing 176 member states, said Friday that he hoped there would be no repeat of how the week's discussions had gone.

""It doesn't help your organization, it doesn't help yourself,"" he told delegates.

A European Union source said that many countries have changed their minds under pressure from the United States.

A spokesman for U.N. chief Antonio Guterres called it ""a missed opportunity for member states to place the shipping sector on a clear, credible path towards net zero emissions.""

The International Chamber of Shipping, representing more than 80% of the world's fleet, also expressed disappointment.

""Industry needs clarity to be able to make the investments needed to decarbonize the maritime sector,"" its Secretary General Thomas Kazakos said in a statement.

Since returning to power in January, Trump has reversed Washington's course on climate change and encouraged fossil fuel use by deregulation.

""I am outraged that the International Maritime Organization is voting in London this week to pass a global Carbon Tax,"" Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform Thursday.

""The United States will NOT stand for this Global Green New Scam Tax on Shipping,"" he added, telling countries to vote against it.

Washington threatened to impose sanctions, visa restrictions and port levies on those supporting the Net Zero Framework (NZF), the first global carbon-pricing system.

Major oil-producer Saudi Arabia also called for Friday's vote to be postponed.

""We agree with the United States that it's important that these conversations are brought to light,"" a Saudi representative said.

Ahead of this week's London gathering, a majority 63 IMO members that in April voted for the plan had been expected to maintain their support and to be joined by others to formally approve the NZF.

Argentina, which in April abstained from the vote, now opposes the deal.

Leading up to Friday's decision, China, the EU, Brazil, Britain and several other members of the IMO reaffirmed their support.

The NZF requires ships to progressively reduce carbon emissions from 2028 or face financial penalties.

Shipping accounts for nearly 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions, according to the IMO.

The plan would charge ships for emissions exceeding a certain threshold, with proceeds used to reward low-emission vessels and support countries vulnerable to climate change.

If the global emissions pricing system were adopted, it would become difficult to evade, even for the United States.

Deal blocked

The International Maritime Organization (IMO) got the IMO Net-Zero Framework approved in April after 10 years of negotiations. The goal was to reduce fossil fuel usage in the shipping industry and limit emissions. Shipping represents 3% of all global emissions.

President Donald Trump, Saudi Arabia and several other countries sought to end the deal over costs.

During a meeting on Friday, Saudi Arabia called a vote to adjourn the meeting for one year. More than half the countries agreed, including several that had originally been in favor of the deal.

That included island nations like the Bahamas and Antigua. They told the BBC they rely on the U.S. for trade and received pressure from the Trump administration to change their vote.

Trump threatened tariffs, the withdrawal of visa rights and more against countries that voted in favor of the deal. The president made his feelings about it clear on social media Thursday.

“The United States will NOT stand for this Global Green New Scam Tax on Shipping, and will not adhere to it in any way, shape, or form,” Trump wrote. “We will not tolerate increased prices on American Consumers OR, the creation of a Green New Scam Bureaucracy to spend YOUR money on their Green dreams.”

Reaction to the vote

Those in support of the deal seemed determined to get it back on track, even if it takes a year.

“What matters now is that countries rise up and come back to the IMO with a louder and more confident ‘yes’ vote that cannot be silenced,” Anaïs Rios, shipping policy officer for Seas At Risk, said. “The planet and the future of shipping does not have time to waste.”

One supporter also seemed hopeful about keeping the deal alive, even as she blamed the U.S.

“The delay leaves the shipping sector drifting in uncertainty,” Alison Shaw, IMO Manager at Transport & Environment, a Brussels-based environmental nongovernmental organization, said. “But this week has also shown that there is a clear desire to clean up the shipping industry, even in the face of U.S. bullying.”

Back stateside, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio celebrated the decision.

“This is another HUGE win for @POTUS,” Rubio wrote on X. “Thanks to his leadership, the United States prevented a massive UN tax hike on American consumers that would have funded progressive climate pet projects. Our country will continue to lead the way and put America FIRST.”

IMO Net-Zero Framework

The goal of the measure was to get the shipping industry to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by roughly 2050. The way they planned on getting there was to set a marine fuel standard that would get stricter over time.

The deal would also set fees for emissions above the allowed limits. In essence, it would be a tax on countries that break the rules.

It would have made shipping the first industry to adopt internationally mandated targets to reduce emissions.

According to recent data, Greece, which also voted against the deal, is the country with the highest emissions from global shipping. It’s followed by Japan and the U.S.

The cost

The Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC) led the market for shipping companies in total imports to the U.S. in 2024. That’s followed by Maersk Line and Compagnie Maritime d’Affretement, or CMA.

MSC is a privately held company, so its revenue is unclear, but the other two brought in a combined $99.58 billion last year.

Despite that, Trump and other administration officials were concerned that added costs from a tax would be passed on to American consumers at a time when inflation is already an issue.

The fees associated with the proposal, according to a conglomerate of shipping companies, would have cost them an estimated $20 to $30 billion annually by 2030. They said in a letter to the IMO that the cost would increase to $300 billion by 2050 if global fleets missed the targets by only 10%, according to industry site GCaptain.com.",https://san.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2240708992_CFOTOFuture_Publishing_via_Getty_Images_clean.jpg,N,,2025-10-18 12:56:26.186780

“The United States will NOT stand for this Global Green New Scam Tax on Shipping,” he said.

A fractious meeting of the International Maritime Organization in London ended Friday with a decision to adjourn for a year, after Saudi Arabia, backed by Russia, pushed for a pause.

That means the effort to set binding international rules to cut greenhouse gases from shipping — responsible for about 3 percent of global emissions — goes into the deep freeze for a year. During that time, the U.S. and other opponents can try to rally more support to kill it completely.

The move followed an extended pressure campaign from the United States marked by threats of tariffs and other economic penalties. It is also a huge setback for the European Union, which failed to push through the measure and even saw some of its member countries abstain.

The White House reacted with joy.

“President Trump saved America from the outrageous climate scam that was killing our country, and he has long warned others to abandon this destructive agenda before it is too late. Stopping this disastrous vote is a massive win for the American people and countries around the world,"" said White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers.

But European Commission Executive Vice President Teresa Ribera called the delay “a huge shame,” in a social media post. The EU and Brazil had been publicly backing the move ahead of COP30 global climate talks next month, hosted by Brazil.

The proposal up for approval at the IMO, the U.N. agency that regulates global shipping, was meant to incentivize countries to shift toward using cleaner fuels in a bid to zero out carbon emissions from shipping by 2050. It would have increased the financial burden on polluting ships over time. Fees collected would go to help fund the shift to greener fuels and support developing countries.

The White House had objected for months, with Trump himself weighing in on Thursday in a post on Truth Social that he was “outraged” by the effort. “The United States will NOT stand for this Global Green New Scam Tax on Shipping,” he said.

It comes as the United States grows increasingly hostile in its approach to climate measures, with Trump calling climate change a “con job” and urging other countries to drop efforts to invest in renewable energy.

There had been “relentless pressure” from the U.S. for countries to back its position, said Vanuatu Climate Minister Ralph Regenvanu. “There’s bullshit going on,” the Pacific Island nation minister said during a coffee break before the final vote.

Shifting votes

The motion to adjourn on Friday passed by just four votes, after several countries that had previously backed the measure, including EU members Greece and Cyprus, chose to abstain.

""The net zero framework relies on fuels and technologies that aren’t available at scale, and introduces sharp penalties for not using them, which would inflate costs as companies chase limited supplies,"" said a Greek official, speaking on condition of anonymity. Greece hosts some of the world’s leading shipping companies.

Representatives from Cyprus declined to comment on their vote.

The delay dismayed countries backing an effort to cut emissions from a sector that is seeing fast growth.

“They killed [the agreement]. The lack of leadership from the EU makes my blood boil,” said one person with knowledge of the discussions, also granted anonymity to speak candidly.

However, the move garnered support from major fossil fuels producers, such as Saudi Arabia and Russia, which traditionally push back against climate measures aimed at cutting the use of oil, gas and coal. Major shipping countries and several with large flag registries, including Singapore and Liberia, also objected.

Others shifted positions.

China, the world’s biggest ship builder, switched from supporting the measure in April, to voting to delay it on Friday.

The clash highlighted the differences between countries worried about the measure's economic impact against those fearing the consequences of global warming.

A Saudi delegate, who could not be named due to the IMO’s restrictions on reporting, accused backers of the carbon price of sowing global division. ""We have differences because we are all looking out for our citizens, our futures ... and our economies,” he said.

But Emma Fenton, senior diplomacy director at Opportunity Green, an NGO, called the outcome “a devastating indictment of member states’ lack of courage to stand in solidarity with climate-vulnerable countries to achieve a just and equitable maritime transition.""

A European Commission spokesperson called the delay “regrettable” and stressed the EU’s commitment to an “ambitious, science-based global framework” to put international shipping on track for net-zero emissions by 2050.

The spokesperson added that Europe “remains an open and reliable partner” and is ready to resume talks “under IMO leadership when appropriate.”

The International Chamber of Shipping, a global trade association representing more than 80 percent of the world’s merchant fleet, said it was disappointed with the outcome.

“Industry needs clarity to be able to make the investments needed to decarbonize the maritime sector,” Thomas A. Kazakos, the chamber’s secretary-general, said in a statement. “As an industry we will continue to work with the IMO, which is the best organization to deliver the global regulations needed for a global industry.”

Shipping accounts for some 3 per cent of the global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

The vote came on a motion moved by Saudi Arabia on Friday to adjourn the meeting for a year after four days of disagreements over the proposal.

The MEPC meeting of the IMO, held between October 14-17, to adopt the Net Zero Framework (NZF) for shipping, first agreed in April this year, got off to a shaky start after the United States put member states on notice on October 10, threatening them with a raft of penal actions, if they supported what would be the first global carbon tax.

The United States said it would pursue investigations and potential regulations to combat anti-competitive practices from certain flagged countries and potential blocking of vessels registered in those countries from US ports; impose commercial penalties stemming from US government contracts including new commercial ships, liquified natural gas terminals and infrastructure, and/or other financial penalties on ships flagged under nations in favour of the NZF; impose additional port fees on ships owned, operated, or flagged by countries supporting the framework; and evaluate sanctions on officials sponsoring activist-driven climate policies that would burden American consumers.

Hours ahead of the vote on Friday, US President Donald Trump posted on his social media platform ‘Truth Social’ that he was “outraged that the International Maritime Organization is voting in London this week to pass a global Carbon Tax”.

“The United States will NOT stand for this Global Green New Scam Tax on Shipping, and will not adhere to it in any way, shape, or form. We will not tolerate increased prices on American Consumers OR, the creation of a Green New Scam Bureaucracy to spend YOUR money on their Green dreams. Stand with the United States, and vote NO in London tomorrow!”, he wrote.

Advt

Trump’s warning had a chilling effect on many member states with 57 voting to delay the adoption of the deal while 49 opposed it and 21 abstained at the end of four days of acrimonious talks.

India voted in favour of adjournment, a government official confirmed. “It was totally a call of the Ministry of External Affairs,” he added.

Hybrid model favoured

At the MEPC meeting in April this year, India voted in favour of a hybrid model for carbon pricing, in a bid to make the shipping industry the first in the world to adopt internationally mandated targets to lower emissions.

These measures were set to be formally adopted in October before entering into force in 2027.

""You have one year to negotiate and talk and come to consensus,"" Arsenio Dominguez, Secretary General, IMO, said in his closing remarks.

The Net Zero Framework would have created the first global carbon pricing mechanism for any industrial sector with the aim of delivering a clear path for shipping’s transition to net zero.

“We are disappointed that member states have not been able to agree a way forward at this meeting. Industry needs clarity to be able to make the investments needed to decarbonise the maritime sector, in line with the goals set out in the IMO GHG strategy,” said Thomas Kazakos, Secretary General, International Chamber of Shipping.

As an industry we will continue to work with the IMO, which is the best organisation to deliver the global regulations needed for a global industry, Kazakos said in a statement after the MEPC meeting concluded without a deal.

The NZF regulation and its supporting guidelines can give shipping companies as well as fuel producers and suppliers the confidence and clarity to mobilise investment and scale alternative fuels such as methanol worldwide, the Methanol Institute, a lobby group, said in a statement ahead of the MEPC meeting.

“Methanol producers are ready to deliver. Today, there is already enough methanol available to fuel the ships in operation. More than 250 projects for low-carbon, bio- and e-methanol are under development worldwide, with significant new volumes expected to come online by 2027–2028. The Methanol Institute estimates that between 7 and 14 million tonnes of renewable and low-carbon methanol could be available globally by 2030. This demonstrates that the supply chain is moving quickly to scale and that the fuels to enable the transition will be available when they’re needed,” it argued.

“Adopting the framework would mark the most significant milestone yet in shipping’s decarbonisation journey. It would send a strong signal for investment and support millions of jobs in clean energy sectors. Failing to adopt the NZF will slow progress, create uncertainty around the availability of alternative fuels, and leave the industry with a patchwork of national and regional rules that will be costlier, more burdensome and less effective,” it said, adding that by adopting the Net Zero Framework, the IMO member states “can set the global shipping industry on a fair and effective course to achieve net zero by 2050”.

Urging the member states to take the “courageous step” to adopt the Net-Zero Framework, the Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller Centre for Zero Carbon Shipping said that it “provides certainty for the transition, with clear and pragmatic targets for reducing GHG intensity and real incentives to drive change”.

“Doing nothing comes at a high cost: uncertainty, fragmentation, and missing investment in needed innovation. Adoption will set a standard for global cooperation on climate, balancing the urgency to address emissions with the practical realities of the industry. This is a historic chance for shipping to lead the way toward a sustainable future,” it said ahead of the meeting.

Threat to SMEs

The NZF is based on a fee structure on carbon emissions intended to incentivise green-fuel usage. But as the availability of green fuels on the market in the near term is extremely limited, many operators will likely pay the fee, feeding an IMO-administered fund at an estimated rate of about $10 billion per year (globally). These funds would be used to reward low-emissions ships, pay for green fuel infrastructure and R&D, and to offset the cost effects of the regulation on vulnerable states, notably shipping-dependent island nations.

""As currently drafted, the NZF poses a serious threat to the European shipping, economy, and energy security, and also represents a grave danger to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs),"" the CUS argued. ""In essence, it represents a multi-billion-euro tax that does not reduce emissions but instead shifts the cost to end-consumers,"" the Cyprus Union of Shipowners (CUS) said in a statement a day before the vote, joining a growing list opposing the IMO proposal.

The shipowners' association criticised the fee and fund plan, calling it a distraction. ""Rather than reducing emissions, the framework diverts critical financial resources away from genuine technological and energy innovation, thereby slowing the transition to cleaner solutions,"" CUS asserted. ""The result will be broad-based price increases, a higher cost of living and intensified inflation,"" it added.

INTERTANKO, the International Association of Independent Tanker Owners, said it will continue its focus on practical pathways in the absence of an agreement at the IMO meeting.

“This gives us time to improve the single regulatory maritime framework to cut maritime emissions. Let’s use this opportunity to work collaboratively to tackle the ambiguities and concerns of the NZF raised by INTERTANKO members,” INTERTANKO Managing Director Tim Wilkins said in a statement.

“It is unclear what the path forward is since the positions are more polarised. The intersessional workgroup meeting at IMO next week will take place and INTERTANKO will continue to voice the concerns of its members, demanding reassurance that all transitional pathways remain in place for the long-term shift to zero- and near-zero fuels, allowing shipowners and operators to focus on operational feasibility,” INTERTANKO said.

INTERTANKO will play an active role in the strategic discussions at hand on the Net Zero Fund and its methods to collect, govern and distribute resources, including incentivising shipowners and operators to invest in efficiency improvements and alternative fuels.

To achieve the zero-GHG future, the full spectrum of transitional pathways must be available, ranging from energy-saving devices such as wind propulsion, to alternative fuels such as LNG and sustainable biofuel, and net-zero technologies such as shore power and carbon capture.

Wilkins asserted that INTERTANKO will continue with its efforts to provide practical and real-world input into the process.

“There’s some misconception that the industry has been sitting around doing nothing, waiting for this decision,” he said, “when in fact, evidence shows the industry has dramatically cut its emissions over the last 10-15 years, and will continue to do so, as it simply makes good business and ethical sense.”

The session is now set to reconvene in 12 months, extending the timeline for finalization and implementation. The NZF forms a key part of the IMO's 2023 Revised GHG Strategy.

It includes measures such as a global carbon pricing system, where ships would pay fees for exceeding carbon intensity limits; a revenue fund expected to generate up to USD 15 billion annually from 2030 to support transitions to cleaner energy; lifecycle emissions standards for fuels; and updated requirements for energy-efficient operations. Shipping accounts for about 3% of global emissions, and the framework seeks to align the sector with the Paris Agreement.

The postponement reflects ongoing differences among member states. Discussions were influenced by positions from various groups, including a U.S.-led initiative supported by oil-producing countries such as Saudi Arabia and Russia. This group advocated for procedural adjustments, including a shift from consensus-based to ""explicit"" adoption, which could affect implementation in certain regions. Singapore proposed the delay motion, which Saudi Arabia moved to a vote, resulting in the narrow approval despite earlier indications of support in April 2025.

After a U.S.-led campaign, the United Nations has postponed a vote on a proposal to impose the world’s first global carbon tax on shipping, delaying the decision by one year.

The rule was expected to come up for a vote this week as part of the U.N. International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) ""Net-Zero Framework."" But a majority of member nations voted to defer it after failing to reach consensus amid U.S. opposition.

Backed by the European Union and Brazil, the plan seeks to raise billions from carriers that exceed new emissions limits, channeling the revenue toward climate adaptation and clean-fuel projects in developing nations.

Washington and Riyadh led the opposition. Saudi Arabia introduced a motion Friday to delay discussions for one year, which passed with 57 countries in favor and 49 opposed.

TRUMP'S GLOBAL RESET OF TRADE RELATIONSHIPS WILL REMAIN IN THE SPOTLIGHT THIS WEEK

The Trump administration came out forcefully against the measure this week, calling it an ""unconstitutional global tax"" that would drive up energy and consumer prices. In a series of statements, President Donald Trump, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Mike Waltz vowed that the United States would vote a ""hard no"" when delegates meet in London on Friday and urged allies to do the same.

""I am outraged that the International Maritime Organization is voting in London this week to pass a global Carbon Tax,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social. ""The United States will NOT stand for this Global Green New Scam Tax on Shipping, and will not adhere to it in any way, shape, or form. We will not tolerate increased prices on American Consumers OR the creation of a Green New Scam Bureaucracy to spend YOUR money on their Green dreams. Stand with the United States, and vote NO in London tomorrow!""

Administration officials argue the framework would give unelected international bureaucrats the power to tax U.S. companies and consumers while doing little to cut global emissions.

""This week, the UN is attempting to pass the first global carbon tax, which will increase energy, food, and fuel costs across the world. We will not allow the UN to tax American citizens and companies,"" Rubio wrote on X.

""This is a bigger deal than I think anybody realizes,"" U.N. Ambassador Mike Waltz said on Fox News.

The U.S. had threatened to retaliate if nations support it. Trump urged countries to vote “No” at the International Maritime Organization headquarters in London, posting on his social media platform Truth Social on Thursday that “the United States will not stand for this global green new scam tax on shipping.”

The IMO is the United Nations agency that regulates international shipping.

Saudi Arabia called for a vote to adjourn the meeting for a year. More than half of the countries agreed.

“Now you have one year, you will continue to work on several aspects of these amendments,” Arsenio Dominguez, secretary general of the International Maritime Organization, said in his closing remarks. “You have one year to negotiate and talk and come to consensus.”

Ralph Regenvanu, minister for climate change for the Pacific Island nation of Vanuatu, said the decision is unacceptable, “given the urgency we face in light of accelerating climate change.”

If the green shipping regulations were adopted, it would have been the first time a global fee was imposed on planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions. Most ships today run on heavy fuel oil that releases carbon dioxide and other pollutants as it’s burned.

“The delay leaves the shipping sector drifting in uncertainty. But this week has also shown that there is a clear desire to clean up the shipping industry, even in the face of U.S. bullying,” said Alison Shaw, IMO Manager at Transport & Environment, a Brussels-based environmental nongovernmental organization.

Shipping emissions have grown over the past decade to about 3% of the global total as trade has grown and vessels use immense amounts of fossil fuels to transport cargo over long distances. In April, IMO member states agreed on the contents of the regulatory framework, with the aim of adopting the “Net-Zero Framework” at this London meeting.

Adopting the regulations was meant to demonstrate how effective multilateral cooperation can deliver real progress on global climate goals, said Emma Fenton, senior director for climate diplomacy at a U.K.-based climate change nonprofit, Opportunity Green. Delaying the process risks undermining the framework’s ambitions, they added.

The regulations would set a marine fuel standard that decreases, over time, the amount of greenhouse gas emissions allowed from using shipping fuels. The regulations also would establish a pricing system that would impose fees for every ton of greenhouse gases emitted by ships above allowable limits, in what is effectively the first global tax on greenhouse gas emissions.

The IMO, which regulates international shipping, set a target for the sector to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by about 2050, and has committed to ensuring that fuels with zero or near-zero emissions are used more widely.

“What matters now is that countries rise up and come back to the IMO with a louder and more confident yes vote that cannot be silenced,” said Anaïs Rios, shipping policy officer for Seas At Risk. “The planet and the future of shipping does not have time to waste.”

Ahead of today’s vote US President Trump had weighed into the debate, expressing outrage over the planned global carbon pricing mechanism. The US has been pressurising smaller member states with tariffs, port fees and blocking of vessels if they supported framework.

According to social media reports, Saudi Arabia sought a one-year delay by way of vote.

Adjourned for a year

The IMO said 57 countries voted in favour of a delay, 49 against and 21 abstained. Eight member states were not present for the vote. “The extraordinary session of the Committee is adjourned for one year,” it said.

Speaking at media briefing after the close of the MEPC meeting and commenting on the delay in adoption of the NZF, Arsenio Dominguez, secretary-general of the IMO said, “It’s very much alive. The decision taken today was to adjourn the extraordinary session that was convened to adopt the amendments for one year. And as was clarified by the chair that next week the intercessional working group will meet and they have a work plan that was discussed and agreed and will continue to move forward.”

Blow to the IMO?

Asked if it the delay would impact the IMO he said, “I don’t see it as blow to the organisation and I want to make that clear and there is a lot of work that comes out from IMO and I think we have demonstrated that for over 50 years.”

The secretary-general also acknowledged the wider geopolitical pressures that were at play during the meeting. “It wasn’t the normal meeting of IMO. But this is topic that transcends IMO. The geopolitics in the world right now make it as well more challenging to make progress on certain topics but I will maintain that member states have the right to express their opinion, to negotiate among each other. I’m not here to qualify that, I’m here to continue to work with all of them.”

Entry into force would have been March 2027

The original entry into force for the NZF would have been in March 2027 if the framework had been approved at the extraordinary meeting of the MEPC. This timeframe will now be reviewed.

Seatrade Cruise News reached out to Cruise Lines International Association for reaction and will update this story if comment is provided.

The International Chamber of Shipping (ICS), which has pushed for a carbon fund for a number of years, expressed its disappointment at the delay.

Industry needs clarity

Thomas A. Kazakos, ICS secretary general, said: “We are disappointed that member states have not been able to agree a way forward at this meeting. Industry needs clarity to be able to make the investments needed to decarbonise the maritime sector, in line with the goals set out in the IMO GHG strategy.""

Independent tanker owner representative group Intertanko was more positive, hoping the extra time could result in a better framework. Intertanko Managing Director Tim Wilkins said: “This gives us time to improve the single regulatory maritime framework to cut maritime emissions. Let’s use this opportunity to work collaboratively to tackle the ambiguities and concerns of the NZF raised by Intertanko members.”

However, he also noted that ""It is unclear what the path forward is since the positions are more polarised.""

Major setback: IAPH

The International Association of Ports and Harbours (IAPH), which supports the NZF, said it was a major setback as the industry needs the legal certainty it would provide to make investments in decarbonisation. IAPH Managing Director Patrick Verhoeven commented: ""Only IMO can provide such a framework. We don’t know what this adjournment will lead to, but we fear it will simply open the door for more national and regional measures, which will add to an already complex regulatory patchwork resulting in unintended consequences.”

The Global Maritime Forum, which represents many of the companies and organisations that have been frontrunners in decarbonisation for shipping, said the delay would make meeting the industry's emission targets more challenging.

“Today's adjournment is a disappointing setback for shipping, but not the end of this journey. The adjournment for a full year creates serious challenges for meeting the timelines in the Net-Zero Framework agreed in April and will make delivery of the sector’s decarbonisation targets even more challenging,"" said Jesse Fahnestock, director of decarbonisation at the Global Maritime Forum.

Environmental groups

Environmental groups were also, not surprisingly, disappointed in the outcome.

Teresa Bui, senior climate campaign director, Pacific Environment, said: “Delaying the vote on the International Maritime Organization’s Net-Zero Framework is frustrating and a betrayal of the world’s most vulnerable nations. We urge IMO member states to adopt the Framework as soon as possible.”

Members of the United Nations International Maritime Organization's (IMO) Marine Environment Protection Committee gathered in London for a special meeting, MEPC 83, to vote on its Net-Zero Framework (NZF), a new set of global regulations aimed at slashing the shipping industry's greenhouse gas emissions.

A Saudi proposal to adjourn the meeting and delay a final decision on the NZF narrowly passed by a vote of 57-49, with 21 abstentions, Mongabay reported.

The NZF—whose goal is net-zero shipping by 2050—has two main interconnected components, a global fuel standard requiring ships to gradually reduce emissions, and a pricing mechanism meant to encourage the industry to voluntarily slash greenhouse gas output.

""The delay leaves the shipping sector drifting in uncertainty.""

The NZF was approved at the last MEPC meeting in April, then shared with member nations for review, with an eye toward final assent during the current special meeting. However, while the European Union and nations including China and Brazil have been pushing for the NZF, the world's two largest oil producers—the United States and Saudi Arabia—are working to scupper the proposal, which Russia also opposes.

Trump took to his Truth Social network Thursday to pressure MEPC members to vote ""no"" on the NZF:

I am outraged that the International Maritime Organization is voting in London this week to pass a global Carbon Tax. The United States will NOT stand for this Global Green New Scam Tax on Shipping, and will not adhere to it in any way, shape, or form. We will not tolerate increased prices on American Consumers OR, the creation of a Green New Scam Bureaucracy to spend YOUR money on their Green dreams. Stand with the United States, and vote NO in London tomorrow!

The one-year postponement drew sharp rebuke from supporters of the NZF.

“We are disappointed that member states have not been able to agree a way forward at this meeting,"" International Chamber of Shipping secretary general Thomas Kazakos said following Friday's vote. ""Industry needs clarity to be able to make the investments needed to decarbonize the maritime sector, in line with the goals set out in the IMO [greenhouse gas] strategy.""

""As an industry we will continue to work with the IMO, which is the best organization to deliver the global regulations needed for a global industry,"" Kazakos added.

John Maggs, who represents the Clean Shipping Coalition at the IMO, said in a statement, “By delaying adoption of its Net-Zero Framework, IMO has today squandered an important opportunity to tackle global shipping’s contribution to climate breakdown.""

“With climate warming impacts being felt everywhere on Earth, kicking this decision down the road is simply evading reality,"" he added. ""Governments serious about climate action must spend the next 12 months rallying every nation that supports the framework, convincing those who are on the fence, or opposing, that its adoption is the only sane way forward.”

Elissama Menezes, co-founder and director of the advocacy organization Equal Routes, said: ""Delay costs the climate—and coastal Indigenous peoples and Arctic communities are already paying the price for inaction. This week’s non-outcome should mean that states and the marine sector should double down on related efforts to reduce the impacts from the triple planetary crisis.”

Faig Abbasov, director of shipping at the green group Transport & Environment, told Reuters that ""the delay leaves the shipping sector drifting in uncertainty.""

Global shipping accounts for approximately 3% of the world's CO2 emissions. Approximately 90% of all international trade is conducted at sea, and proponents of the NZF warn that emissions will soar without the regulations.

While leading shipping companies including Maersk and CMA CGM have taken steps to transition their fleets to zero emission vessels, they are still falling short of the goals laid out in the landmark Paris climate agreement or even the IMO’s own 2023 emissions reduction strategy.

”However, all is not lost—not by a long shot,"" said Maggs, ""as there is an immediate opportunity to slash [greenhouse gas] emissions from shipping, minimize fuel burn, and the overall cost of the energy transition, and that is to strengthen and make enforceable the carbon intensity indicator (CII), the IMO’s cornerstone energy efficiency measure.""

It’s just a room in which people from 176 countries gather to talk about the big issues.

So the fact the IMO failed to come up with a global answer to climate change — one of the biggest issues of them all — is disappointing, but not that surprising.

Countries voted 57-49 to adjourn the MEPC meeting for one year, in a win for opponents of carbon pricing. The NZF is not dead, or at least not yet. But its odds of being adopted, and of entering into force, look worse.

The framework, which if adopted would tax ships for a slice of their GHG emissions to raise billions for green R&D and climate change causes, sailed through its approval vote with a 63-16 majority six months ago. The US had boycotted that vote.

It then took just under six months for the Trump administration to wake up to what such a regulation could mean. Its response was an overwhelming show of diplomatic force, including threats at a state, company and individual level.

The US did all it could to bully, threaten or cajole countries into backing down. It will probably do so again next year. But this is Trump, so trying to predict the future is pointless.

Saudi Arabia meanwhile outfoxed its EU opponents with sulphurous poise, hogging the mic and using every trick in the rulebook to undermine the majority in favour of the carbon tax.

China, whose support for approval was big news at MEPC83, switched to supporting the delay. Greece and Cyprus abstained, in breach of EU rules, and reflecting their shipping industries’ strong misgivings about the carbon price.

A No vote would have killed the NZF outright and left the IMO rudderless on climate, with no clear alternative for achieving its (non-binding) net zero strategy. A Yes vote depending on ‘explicit’ acceptance rules would have seen it adopted, then strangled at birth.

Friday’s vaguer outcome means that draft legal text agreed so far may live on in some other form. More time to fix the NZF’s substantial weaknesses may not be an entirely bad thing.

The work will go on at IMO, but the momentum of MEPC83 has been dealt a blow. The global signal shipping needs to invest in greener technologies is still nowhere to be found.

IMO secretary-general Arsenio Dominguez will come under fire for this result, but he doesn’t deserve it. He has no power to change the paths of powerful states, only the thankless task of urging them to work together.

Many believe that climate change is too big an issue for the IMO to solve. This week was more evidence that international law depends on politics, and politics will follow only the law of the jungle — the eternal fight for power, wealth and influence.

Even if the NZF is adopted, it will not have a happy life as long as the world’s major powers remain at odds over its goals.

Thus, if everything works as planned, the regulations will reduce global greenhouse gas emissions by about 1 percent.","A fight is brewing ahead of the upcoming meeting of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) over new rules to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the shipping industry. Formal approval at the October 14-17 meeting was assumed until the United States announced its opposition to the regulations in August and called on other governments to reject the proposal or face retaliation.

The IMO is an unlikely place for this confrontation. As a United Nations specialized agency focusing on setting universal standards for maritime safety and security, the IMO is rarely controversial. In fact, the IMO is one of only a handful of UN organizations identified in the Trump administration’s fiscal year 2026 budget request as deserving of US funding. Specifically, it was highlighted for its standards setting, efforts to reduce pollution and prevent maritime disasters, and enhancing US security by helping “secure shipping lanes against terrorism and related threats.”

Nonetheless, the IMO finds itself in the crosshairs of the Trump administration.

The dispute centers on draft amendments to the existing International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL), which the United States ratified in 1980 to address pollution of the marine environment by ships. The new rules, if approved in October, would be added to Annex VI of MARPOL and would apply to all parties to the agreement and annex 16 months after adoption through a process called “tacit acceptance.” The United States is a party to both MARPOL and Annex VI of the convention.

These regulations seek to implement the IMO “Net-Zero Framework” through mandatory fuel standards for ships over 5,000 gross tonnage and financial penalties for those failing to comply. Military and domestic shipping vessels are exempted. Overall, however, covered ships account for about 85 percent of global emissions from the shipping industry.

Under the proposal, ships must reduce their annual greenhouse gas fuel intensity (the amount of greenhouse gas emitted for each unit of energy used). Specifically, ships with emissions over two specified thresholds, which increase annually from 2028 to 2035, would be required to pay fines ($100 per ton of excess emissions over the first threshold and $380 per ton of excess emissions over the second) into an “IMO Net-Zero Fund.” Revenues would be used to reward ships with low emissions, support research and technology transfer, and help mitigate the impact of the regulations on vulnerable states.

What impact will the new regulations have? The most recent IMO study found that shipping accounted for 2.89 percent of global anthropogenic emissions. The IMO projects that the regulations could reduce greenhouse gas emissions from shipping by 40 percent. Thus, if everything works as planned, the regulations will reduce global greenhouse gas emissions by about 1 percent.

But things may not go as planned.

The new regulations would take effect in 2027, giving ships a relatively short window to come into compliance. According to shipping firms, fines could amount to “about $20 billion to $30 billion a year by 2030,” with the cumulative total possibly exceeding “$300 billion by 2035 if the global fleet misses targets by as little as 10%.”

The financial penalties are intended to incentivize compliance. However, the costs of compliance are even steeper. Over 90 percent of the current global fleet uses conventional fuels and cannot utilize greener alternatives. Retrofitting existing ships is expensive, and some may choose to pay the fines instead.

In addition to retrofitting ships, infrastructure also needs to be overhauled, including investments related to new alternative green fuel production and refitting ports for storage and bunkering. According to one estimate, “To meet the International Maritime Organization (IMO) 2050 emission targets, the scale of investment is estimated to be up to $1.9tn.”

Finally, there is the fact that alternative green fuels cost far more—at least three to four times more—than traditional fuels. Consequently, fuel costs are projected to rise by 350 percent.

Overall, whether shippers comply or simply pay fines, the cost of shipping is likely to increase if the IMO regulations are implemented, and consumers will bear the brunt of the price.",https://dredgewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Looming-International-Shipping-Crisis.jpg,N,,2025-10-18 13:56:50.228557

This week's delay follows a 2023 agreement by the International Maritime Organization to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions by around 2050.","Using a battering ram of trade and visa threats, the Trump administration on Friday blocked the adoption of a landmark global measure that would have imposed a global pollution tax on the shipping industry.

Countries meeting in London at the International Maritime Organization, an organization of 176 countries under the umbrella of the United Nations, were supposed to take a final vote Friday on a measure requiring cargo ships to lower their greenhouse gas emissions to a certain threshold or pay a fee.

It had been provisionally adopted in April with the backing of the leading shipping lobby and most of America's allies, including Britain, Canada, the European Union and Japan. China, too, supported the measure.

The United States, backed by Russia and Saudi Arabia, pushed to delay the adoption by a year. The motion to delay was narrowly passed in a vote of 57-49, with other nations absent or abstaining.

The Trump administration brought a raft of threats to dissuade countries from voting for the measure, including blocking supporters' vessels from entering U.S. ports, visa restrictions on their crews, trade investigations, sanctions on individual officials, and loss of contracting opportunities with the U.S.

On Thursday, President Donald Trump said he was ""outraged"" that the organization was considering a carbon-emissions price on global shipping. ""The United States will NOT stand for this Global Green New Scam Tax on Shipping, and will not adhere to it in any way, shape or form,"" he wrote in a social media post. He branded the plan a scheme by bureaucrats to raise prices on American consumers to pursue ""their Green Dreams.""

In a joint statement issued last week, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the United States was considering antitrust investigations into countries that support the measure and ""blocking vessels registered in those countries from U.S. ports.""

The statement referred to the proposed fee as a ""European-led neocolonial export of global climate regulations"" and said that it would raise shipping costs.

The European Union then issued a two-sentence statement of support for the tax proposal, saying it would ""ensure a global level playing field.""

Arsenio Dominguez, the secretary-general of the International Maritime Organization, called out the pressure campaign against the measure, without naming any countries.

""It's the manner in which the conversations took place this week,"" he said. ""This was not the normal IMO meeting.""

He made a plea to country representatives to behave better when they return next year to consider the measure.

""Be nice and kind to each other,"" he said. ""It doesn't cost much.""

The conflict at the International Maritime Organization comes at a time when the high seas have become a high stakes battleground for U.S. power.

Trump has upended global trade with a series of unpredictable tariffs. The U.S. and China are charging extra fees on each other's ships docking at their ports.

In response to a request for comment, the State Department pointed to the joint statement.

Traditional shipping fuel, also known as bunker fuel, is a heavy oil that produces carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide when burned. New kinds of fuels are being developed, including ammonia and hydrogen-based alternatives.

The proposed Net-Zero Framework, as it is called, would require cargo ships weighing 5,000 tons or more to pay a fee if their carbon dioxide emissions exceed a threshold level and in effect, reward ships that use cleaner fuels.

If the compact had been approved this week, the new rules would have been set to take effect by March of 2027.

All large ships traversing international waters, including cruise lines, would have had to start by cutting their emissions 17% by 2028.

The proceeds would mostly be used to help the industry transition to less polluting fuels.

The World Shipping Council called it a ""carefully balanced regulatory package."" Another industry lobby, the International Chamber of Shipping, also backed the measure.

""We are disappointed that member states have not been able to agree a way forward at this meeting,"" Thomas Kazakos, the International Chamber's secretary-general, said in a statement Friday after the vote. ""Industry needs clarity to be able to make the investments needed to decarbonize the maritime sector.""

Small island nations facing climate catastrophe had protested that the draft compact was too weak and would not go far enough to save their communities from rising seas and extreme weather.

This week's delay follows a 2023 agreement by the International Maritime Organization to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions by around 2050.

Last year, it offered a more concrete plan, which included an industrywide carbon price.

In April this year, countries voted on a draft agreement. The United States walked out of those proceedings in April.

Russia and Saudi Arabia voted against it at the time.

Ralph Regenvanu, the climate minister of Vanuatu, a small Pacific island nation among the world's most vulnerable to sea level rise, called it ""unacceptable given the urgency we face in light of accelerating climate change.""

The vote shocked some of the nongovernmental organizations that have been working on this framework for years.

The Ocean Conservancy, a nonprofit based in Washington, called the failure to adopt the framework ""disgraceful.""

""The agreement would have slashed carbon emissions and saved lives,"" said a statement from Delaine McCullough, the group's shipping program director. ""A world without this agreement is dirtier and more dangerous for people, wildlife and the ocean.""

Trump and his allies argue the “Net‑Zero Framework” would amount to a hidden global tax on American consumers and put U.S. producers at a disadvantage if foreign ships faced stricter costs.

Still, the delay delivers only temporary relief for agriculture. While the proposed IMO rules would cover vessels over 5,000 gross tons (which account for more than 85% of global shipping emissions), many in the biofuel and ethanol industries see potential opportunity in cleaner ship fuels. The Renewable Fuels Association suggests that if ethanol or other biofuels gained even a small share of the maritime fuel market, U.S. growers could see significant new demand — possibly hundreds of millions of gallons and millions of bushels of corn.

The framework would have marked a major turning point for a sector that’s responsible for 3% of global emissions, of course.
“Over the past two years people have really started investing around the anticipation of something like the Net-Zero Framework being adopted,” Danaher told me.
Let’s rip the Band-Aid off, and let’s get clarity,” Danaher told me.
“A lot of wars happen in and around the oceans, because that’s where we intersect each other the most.” Danaher told me.","Today, members of the International Maritime Organization decided to postpone a major vote on the world’s first truly global carbon pricing scheme. The yearlong delay came in response to a pressure campaign led by the U.S.

The Net-Zero Framework — initially approved in April by an overwhelming margin and long expected to be formally adopted today — would establish a legally binding requirement for the shipping industry to cut its emissions intensity, with interim steps leading to net zero by 2050.

In the intervening months, however, U.S. opposition has gotten much louder. On Thursday, Trump posted on Truth Social that he’s “outraged that the International Maritime Organization is voting in London this week to pass a global Carbon Tax.” He also took the extraordinary step of threatening not to comply with the rules. “The United States will NOT stand for this Global Green New Scam Tax on Shipping, and will not adhere to it in any way, shape, or form.” If the framework ever does pass, noncompliance could subject U.S. vessels to fines or even denial of entry at the ports of IMO member countries, potentially setting off a cycle of retaliatory measures from all sides.

No specific date has yet been scheduled for the forthcoming vote, which will be taken again a year from now. That throws plans for the world’s largest shipping companies — some of which have already taken expensive measures to decarbonize their fleets — into turmoil. The framework would have marked a major turning point for a sector that’s responsible for 3% of global emissions, of course. But even more importantly, it would have made a range of decarbonization technologies — from advanced batteries and clean fuels to wind-assisted propulsion and onboard carbon capture — far more viable and attractive to investors.

Kate Danaher, managing director of the oceans team at S2G Investments, has a vested interest in the frameworks’ eventual passage. “Over the past two years people have really started investing around the anticipation of something like the Net-Zero Framework being adopted,” Danaher told me. For its part, S2G has invested in Sofar Ocean, which focuses on fuel savings through route optimization, battery company Echandia which is aiming to electrify smaller vessels, and ocean data and monitoring companies Xocean and Apeiron Lab.

The new rules were originally set to take effect in 2028, and would apply to large vessels — ships of 5,000 gross tonnage or more — involved in international voyages. Qualifying ships would be assigned a base target for emissions intensity and a stricter “direct compliance target.” For every metric ton of CO2 equivalent that exceeds the compliance target but falls below the base target, ships must pay $100. For all emissions that exceed the base target, ships must pay $380 per metric ton. Noncompliant ships would pay these penalties by purchasing so-called “remedial units” from a central IMO registry, while the cleanest vessels — those performing better than their compliance targets — would earn surplus units they can sell to others or bank for future use.

Green shipping fuels such as e-methanol, e-hydrogen, and e-ammonia — all produced from green hydrogen using renewable electricity — stand to be the biggest winners, she said. “A new fuel would completely decarbonize the industry. That is 10 years out, and is completely contingent on the IMO,” Danaher said, explaining that if the framework ultimately fails, there’s no economic incentive to adopt these more expensive fuels, which also require costly retrofits for existing fleets. But the framework would effectively cause the cost of conventional fuel to rise just as alternative fuels are scaling up, which would allow them to reach parity around 2035, she said.

A specialized agency within the United Nations, the IMO gets its power to set global regulations from the vastness of the ocean itself. Most of the world’s waters exist outside the jurisdiction of any national government. Because of that, IMO member states — which represent the vast majority of global shipping tonnage — have ratified treaties that empower the organization to set safety, security, and environmental standards on the high seas, which members then implement and enforce through their own national laws. Only member states have a stake in IMO policy. Furthermore, vessels that aren’t IMO-compliant face penalties such as fees and even possible detentions when entering the ports of IMO countries.

While IMO decisions are typically made via negotiated consensus, the contentious nature of these new regulations necessitates a vote. U.S. officials celebrated the delay. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio posted on X that the postponement represents “another HUGE win for @POTUS,” going on to say that “the United States prevented a massive UN tax hike on American consumers that would have funded progressive climate pet projects.”

Along with Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, and Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy, Rubio last week issued a statement threatening to punish nations that voted in favor of these “activist-driven climate policies” with actions such as banning their ships from U.S. ports, imposing vessel fees, and even leveling sanctions on officials supportive of the regulations.

Saudi Arabia — the world’s second largest oil producer after the U.S. — also strongly opposed the framework, as did a host of other oil-producing Middle Eastern countries, Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan, Thailand, Russia and Venezuela. Singapore ultimately put forth the motion to delay the adoption vote for a full year and Saudi Arabia called it to a vote. It passed with a simple majority, with 57 countries approving and 49 opposed.

When it comes to costs, Trump officials might actually have a point, Danaher conceded. “Once alternative fuels come online and people are actively paying penalties, it gets a lot more expensive,” she told me. “I don’t see how this isn’t incredibly inflationary to the global market in 10 years.”

Today’s standard low-sulfur fuel, she explained, costs about $500 per metric ton. But reaching the same energy density with e-methanol, for example, could push the price to around $2,000 a metric ton. “That is all going to get passed on, essentially, to the consumer,” she said.

Even so, the framework has the backing of major shipping trade organizations and industry giants alike, from the International Chamber of Shipping to Maersk. As a group of leading international maritime associations put it in an open letter last week, “Only global rules will decarbonise a global industry. Without the Framework, shipping would risk a growing patchwork of unilateral regulations, increasing costs without effectively contributing to decarbonisation.”

Indeed, a universal set of coherent rules is what many in the sector want most, Danaher affirmed. Some voting bodies, such as the EU and Singapore, have already set their own shipping-related emissions requirements, creating a regulatory patchwork that’s both costly and confusing for companies to comply with. “I think most people are like, let’s just do this. Let’s rip the Band-Aid off, and let’s get clarity,” Danaher told me.

In a statement released after the vote’s delay and the conclusion of the IMO’s days-long meeting in London, Thomas A. Kazakos, the shipping chamber’s secretary general, said, “We are disappointed that member states have not been able to agree a way forward at this meeting. Industry needs clarity to be able to make the investments needed to decarbonise the maritime sector, in line with the goals set out in the IMO GHG strategy.”

The delay also risks delegitimizing the power of the IMO as a whole, something the organization’s Secretary-General, Arsenio Dominguez, warned about in the meeting’s opening remarks on Tuesday, when he stated that “Prolonged uncertainty will put off investments and diminish confidence in IMO.”

There would be other ways for shippers to comply with the framework besides switching to e-fuels, Danaher told me. For example, S2G’s portfolio company Sofar Ocean operates a network of ocean sensors designed to improve marine weather predictions and power a route optimization platform that can help ships save time, fuel, and ultimately, emissions.

Software solutions have a pretty low barrier to adoption. But a step up in complexity — and cost — would involve a technology such as wind-assisted propulsion. The companies Norsepower and Anemoi, for example, use a cylindrical “rotor sail” that creates a powerful thrust as it spins, which they say allows for up to 25% to 30% fuel savings. Another approach is the “rigid wing sail,” such as that developed by Bar Technologies. This generates lift in the direction of the ship’s movement with less drag than a normal sail — similar to how an airplane wing works.

Pairing route optimization with wind-assisted propulsion will generate even greater emissions savings, as the software can direct ships towards areas with the most advantageous winds. Given the obvious co-benefits and cost savings stemming from lower fuel use, Danaher thinks this tech could gain traction even if the regulations ultimately fail to pass next year. “I think the adoption curve will still continue without IMO [Net-Zero Framework], but I think it'll be slower,” she told me.

One approach she doesn’t think will be economically viable without the framework is onboard carbon capture. This tech, which traps carbon dioxide from a ship’s exhaust system before it’s released into the atmosphere, is being explored by startups including Seabound — which I reported on last year — and Value Maritime, as well as more established companies such as Mitsubishi and Wartsila. “A lot of the carbon capture technologies have not yet solved for how to turn that captured carbon into a valuable resource, and how to get it off the boat, put it in a pipeline, and sell it,” Danaher told me.” The economic incentive just isn't there without the IMO.”

At the same time, when I talked to one of Seabound’s backers — Clea Kolster, of Lowercarbon Capital — last year, she told me that when it comes to cargo shipping, “carbon capture is probably the only way that you can get a meaningful amount of emissions reductions in any near term way.” And it’s true that alternative fuels will take a while to scale up, so if the framework is ultimately adopted, carbon capture may still have an important role to play — at least that’s what investors and startups alike are banking on. “Everybody's talking about carbon capture in anticipation of this getting adopted,” Danaher told me. “All these vessels are going to be old, they’re going to need to comply, and they’re not going to be able to comply fast enough,” she said.

Amidst the turmoil, one silver lining is that interest in maritime innovation and efficiency appears to be increasing regardless of global frameworks. For one, the surge in global military spending has underscored this tech’s potential for dual-use applications. “A lot of wars happen in and around the oceans, because that’s where we intersect each other the most.” Danaher told me. Many of S2G’s investments in ocean tech have received additional backing from governments and defense agencies looking to make their fleets more efficient, energy resilient, and secure. “Every single one of our ocean tech companies, one of their customers is the government, or many governments,” she said.

It’s an important reminder that there are many practical reasons for investors and states alike to support a decarbonization agenda, regardless of whether the U.S. is on board or not. But a global system of carrots and sticks sure wouldn’t hurt either. And now, we face the uneasy prospect of waiting another year to see whether the shipping industry will resist the Trump-era pushback or abandon its collective ambitions for a decarbonized future.",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTc3MjE2NC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTgxNDgxODAxNX0.ZPRkfApgyfj5AnTZ0ssS4UWWfMiVhyxWh6QoQXV9_5U/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-10-18 13:57:01.661258

The decision to formally delay adopting the framework until late next year came a day after President Trump took to his Truth Social platform, saying: “I am outraged that the International Maritime Organization is voting in London this week to pass a global Carbon Tax.”

“The United States will NOT stand for this Global Green New Scam Tax on Shipping,” he said, telling countries to vote against the plan.

Washington also threatened to impose sanctions, visa restrictions and port levies on countries that supported the deal.

In advance of this week’s meeting in London, about 63 IMO members who had voted for the plan in April were expected to maintain their support for curbs on emissions, and others were expected to join the initiative to formally approve the framework.

Following Trump’s social media threat, delegates in London instead voted on a hastily arranged resolution to push back proceedings on the matter, which passed by 57 votes to 49.

The IMO, which comprises 176 member countries, is responsible for regulating the safety and security of international shipping and preventing pollution on the high seas.

Since returning to power in January, Trump has focused on reversing Washington’s course on climate change, encouraging fossil fuel use by deregulation, cutting funding for clean energy projects and promising businesses to “drill, baby drill”.

‘A missed opportunity’

A spokesman for UN chief Antonio Guterres called Friday’s decisions “a missed opportunity for member states to place the shipping sector on a clear, credible path towards net zero emissions”.

The International Chamber of Shipping, representing more than 80 percent of the world’s fleet, also expressed disappointment.

“Industry needs clarity to be able to make the investments needed to decarbonise the maritime sector,” the chamber’s Secretary-General Thomas Kazakos said in a statement.

Ralph Regenvanu, the minister for climate change for Vanuatu, said the decision to delay the vote by 12 months was “unacceptable given the urgency we face in light of accelerating climate change”.

“But we know that we have international law on our side and will continue to fight for our people and the planet,” Regenvanu added.

Leading up to Friday’s decision, China, the European Union, Brazil, Britain and several other members of the IMO had reaffirmed their support.

Countries that opposed the measures included Russia and Saudi Arabia.

A Russian delegate described the proceedings as “chaos” as he addressed the plenary on Friday after talks had lasted into the early hours.

Argentina and Singapore, two countries that had previously voted in support of the framework in April, were among those that voted to postpone introducing it this week.

If it had been formally adopted this week, the Net Zero Framework (NZF) would have been the first global carbon-pricing system, charging ships a penalty of $380 per metric tonne on every extra tonne of CO2-equivalent they emit while rewarding vessels that reduce their emissions by using alternatives.

The framework plan is intended to help the IMO reach its target of cutting net emissions from international shipping by 20 percent by 2030 and eliminating them by 2050.

Environmentalists eager to curb planet-warming pollution from shipping had grown increasingly confident that countries would adopt the first-ever global tax on emissions this year.

But those predicting success failed to fully account for President Donald Trump harnessing the might of the US against it.

On Friday, nations at a meeting of the UN’s International Maritime Organization voted to delay by one year a decision on the landmark measure that would force large vessels to curb emissions or potentially incur fees of $380 per ton.

The outcome was in part the culmination of a months-long campaign by US officials — including diplomats and cabinet members as well as the president himself — to fight the fee they decried as an untenable global carbon tax.

“President Trump saved America from the outrageous climate scam that was killing our country, and he has long warned others to abandon this destructive agenda before it is too late,” White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said by email. “Stopping this disastrous vote is a massive win for the American people and countries around the world that cannot afford to bend the knee to bogus climate demands any longer.”

Industry Voices Disappointment and Concern as IMO Postpones Global Shipping Carbon Tax Vote

European nations and the UK were among those who had supported the regulations in April when they received preliminary approval, but were on the losing side of Friday’s 57-49 vote in favor of postponement.

The US wasn’t alone in battling the initiative; nations including Saudi Arabia, Iran and Russia had voted against the planned emissions charge in April and on Friday backed the delay.

For months beforehand, US officials had been pressing other countries to oppose the measure, at times by delivering arguments about the potential costs and national security risks, said a senior US State Department official who asked for anonymity to speak candidly.

The administration’s work picked up in July, when the State Department gathered federal agencies to develop a roadmap to defeat the plan. By August, the State Department had launched a global demarche – a formal diplomatic outreach to 108 other nations to lay out its opposition.

US officials also met with European counterparts in Brussels last month to discuss what the senior official described as potential off ramps, and they pressed foreign leaders during meetings on sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York.

Trump administration officials also wielded specific threats, warning other nations they could face tariffs, visa restrictions and financial penalties if they backed the so-called net-zero framework, or NZF. Trump himself has widely used tariffs — and even just the threat of them — to compel other countries to abandon or ease policies with which he disagrees.

“The United States will be moving to levy these remedies against nations that sponsor this European-led neocolonial export of global climate regulations,” Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy vowed in an Oct. 10 statement. “We will fight hard to protect our economic interests by imposing costs on countries if they support the NZF.”

A suite of cabinet officials were enlisted to deliver arguments against the initiative, including Wright and Rubio as well as Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, the official said. Conversations unfolded in text messages, phone calls, emails and public meetings, often tailored to anticipate and emphasize the potential concerns of other countries, the official said.

For instance, Trump administration officials told other nations the fees would deliver widespread economic damage — hiking costs, stoking inflation and imperiling food security — although some analysts have described a more modest financial impact.

They also cast doubt on plans for using the more than $10 billion in revenue the emissions charges were expected to raise annually. While the draft agreement outlined where revenue would end up — including for ships using low-emission fuels — key financial details had not been finalized, feeding US officials’ arguments it could be an “environmental slush fund.”

US representatives also assured countries that had some concerns with the measure that they didn’t need to go along with it. Some countries previously felt like it was a foregone conclusion, the senior State Department official said.

The US opposition may have provided a kind of political cover for other wavering nations — a scenario that could play out in other international climate talks.

Environmentalists called the administration’s approach and the delay misguided. Currently, ships are almost exclusively powered by oil-derived fuels that spew out more than a billion tons of emissions each year.

Also, the delay would lead to a conflicting patchwork of rules and undermines a potential economic bounty for the US, given its advantage producing lower-emission fuels, they said. Ahead of the vote, some US biofuel producers unsuccessfully lobbied the Trump administration to alter course.

Ahead of Friday’s vote, Andrew Forrest, the billionaire founder and chair of of Fortescue Metals Group, decried what he said were “intimidatory tactics” impacting delegates’ ability to vote their conscience.

“As a global industrialist and philanthropist I stand ready to support any country or individual being blackmailed or threatened,” Forrest said in a message to negotiators at the UN agency. “I am committed to working with others to ensure that justice prevails and bullying tactics do not win out.”

Although conversations were at times tense and spirited, there wasn’t intimidation, the State Department official said.

Lobbying continued until the final hours. On the eve of the vote, Trump himself swooped in to reinforce the American position on Thursday, amid a last-ditch effort tied to potentially pausing the meeting.

“The United States will NOT stand for this Global Green New Scam Tax on Shipping, and will not adhere to it in any way, shape, or form,” Trump said in a social media post. “We will not tolerate increased prices on American Consumers OR, the creation of a Green New Scam Bureaucracy to spend YOUR money on their Green dreams.

The U.S. has succeeded in blocking a global fee on shipping emissions as an international maritime meeting adjourned Friday without adopting regulations.

The world’s largest maritime nations had been deliberating on regulations to move the shipping industry away from fossil fuels. But U.S. President Donald Trump, Saudi Arabia and other countries vowed to fight any global tax on shipping emissions.

On Thursday, Trump urged countries to vote “No” on the regulations. The International Maritime Organization adjourned its meeting Friday.

THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below.

The world’s largest maritime nations were deliberating Friday on regulations that would move the shipping industry away from fossil fuels to slash emissions as U.S. President Donald Trump and others vowed to fight any global tax on shipping emissions.

On Thursday, United States President Donald Trump posted on his social media platform Truth Social asking countries to vote “No” and that “The United States will not stand for this global green new scam tax on shipping.”

Representatives from the U.S., Saudi Arabia, Russia and a host of other nations are against the regulations passing through in its current form. The meetings on Friday witnessed a tense start as they continued their discussions from earlier in the week about meeting procedures.

“I put myself out there to try and find a way for you to cooperate and move forward in the normal way that we would,” said Arsenio Dominguez, secretary general of the International Maritime Organization. During his statement, Dominguez added that the way negotiations have happened this week should not be repeated again.

The top shipping nations from across the world are meeting at the International Maritime Organization headquarters in London. If the green shipping regulations are adopted, this will be the first time a global fee is imposed on planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions. Most ships today run on heavy fuel oil that releases carbon dioxide and other pollutants as it’s burned.

Shipping emissions have grown over the past decade to about 3% of the global total as trade has grown and vessels use immense amounts of fossil fuels to transport cargo over long distances. In April, IMO member states agreed on the contents of the regulatory framework, with the aim of adopting the “Net-Zero Framework” at this London meeting.

“The attempts from the U.S. and others to delay the adoption of the IMO’s Net-Zero Framework are an affront to multilateralism and fly in the face of the the courage and ambition shown by member states when it was agreed in April. Thankfully this is not a foregone conclusion and countries can continue to demonstrate the spirit of solidarity that they showed in April when voting to adopt the framework,” said Emma Fenton, senior director for climate diplomacy at a U.K.-based climate change nonprofit, Opportunity Green.

The regulations set a marine fuel standard that decreases, over time, the amount of greenhouse gas emissions allowed from using shipping fuels. The regulations also establish a pricing system that would impose fees for every ton of greenhouse gases emitted by ships above allowable limits, in what is effectively the first global tax on greenhouse gas emissions.

The IMO, which regulates international shipping, set a target for the sector to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by about 2050, and has committed to ensuring that fuels with zero or near-zero emissions are used more widely.

Observers said it is still unclear what will be decided later today.

“By voting for adoption of the framework, governments will make history with the first global carbon price, and set course for reducing shipping’s global impact on the climate,” said John Maggs, the Clean Shipping Coalition’s representative at the IMO. “But failing to support the framework will be a missed opportunity, and risks stagnating action at the IMO for years to come.”",https://wpcdn.us-midwest-1.vip.tn-cloud.net/www.fox21online.com/content/uploads/2020/05/fox-21-avatar.png,N,,2025-10-18 12:00:27.829269

Meeting ends without new regulations, decision on global fee put off until next year

The United States has succeeded in blocking a global fee on shipping emissions as an international maritime meeting adjourned Friday without adopting regulations.

The world's largest maritime nations had been deliberating on adopting regulations to move the shipping industry away from fossil fuels to slash emissions. But U.S. President Donald Trump, Saudi Arabia and other countries vowed to fight any global tax on shipping emissions.

The U.S. had threatened to retaliate if nations support it. Trump urged countries to vote ""No"" at the International Maritime Organization (IMO) headquarters in London, posting on his social media platform Truth Social on Thursday that ""the United States will not stand for this global green new scam tax on shipping.""

The IMO is the United Nations agency that regulates international shipping.

Saudi Arabia called for a vote to adjourn the meeting for a year. More than half of the countries agreed.

""Now you have one year, you will continue to work on several aspects of these amendments,"" Arsenio Dominguez, secretary general of the IMO, said in his closing remarks. ""You have one year to negotiate and talk and come to consensus.""

What this means for climate change

Ralph Regenvanu, minister of climate change for the Pacific island nation of Vanuatu, said the decision is unacceptable, ""given the urgency we face in light of accelerating climate change.""

If the green shipping regulations were adopted, it would have been the first time a global fee was imposed on planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions. Most ships today run on heavy fuel oil that releases carbon dioxide and other pollutants as it's burned.

""The delay leaves the shipping sector drifting in uncertainty. But this week has also shown that there is a clear desire to clean up the shipping industry, even in the face of U.S. bullying,"" said Alison Shaw, IMO manager at Transport & Environment, a Brussels-based environmental non-governmental organization.

Shipping emissions have risen over the past decade to about three per cent of the global total as trade has grown and vessels use immense amounts of fossil fuels to transport cargo over long distances.

Adopting the regulations was meant to demonstrate how effective multilateral co-operation can deliver real progress on global climate goals, said Emma Fenton, senior director for climate diplomacy at a U.K.-based climate change non-profit, Opportunity Green. Delaying the process risks undermining the framework's ambitions, they said.

What the regulations would have done

The regulations would set a marine fuel standard that decreases, over time, the amount of greenhouse gas emissions allowed from using shipping fuels. The regulations also would establish a pricing system that would impose fees for every ton of greenhouse gases emitted by ships above allowable limits, in what is effectively the first global tax on greenhouse gas emissions.

""What matters now is that countries rise up and come back to the IMO with a louder and more confident yes vote that cannot be silenced,"" said Anaïs Rios, shipping policy officer for Seas At Risk. ""The planet and the future of shipping does not have time to waste.""",https://www.cbc.ca/lite/favicon.ico,N,,2025-10-17 23:00:09.615403

Vote to adopt the Net-Zero Framework postponed for one year.

Negotiations at the International Maritime Organization (IMO) have ended in the postponement of the vote to adopt the landmark Net-Zero Framework (NZF) for a year. This comes after a week of pressure and delay tactics from the United States, Saudi Arabia and a number of other countries. The delay undermines years of work on the IMO’s plan to cut shipping’s greenhouse gas emissions, says T&E.

Dr. Alison Shaw, IMO Manager at T&E, said: “The delay leaves the shipping sector drifting in uncertainty.

This pause will push the adoption vote to the next session in October 2026, and it could risk the deal not coming into force until 2030, even if adopted in a year’s time.

Yet even with this delay, the member states should not abandon their ambitions for the NZF. This additional time is a chance to strategically strengthen the framework and ensure it delivers tangible emission reductions. Crucial elements, such as clear incentives for scalable green e-fuels and safeguards to prevent first-generation biofuels from driving deforestation, must be developed.

The decision pushes any adoption of the IMO Net-Zero Framework into late 2026 at the earliest, complicating the timeline for meeting the organisation’s greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction strategy agreed in 2023.

The framework—approved in principle at MEPC 83 in April 2025—sets out a global fuel standard and an emissions pricing mechanism, which together would form the backbone of international shipping’s path to net zero by 2050.

While the main negotiations have been adjourned, the Intersessional Working Group on GHG Emissions Reduction from Ships, due to meet from October 20 to 24, will continue work on developing implementation guidelines in the meantime.

Industry voices have expressed broad disappointment over the delay, warning that the year-long adjournment risks slowing investment and undermining momentum toward shipping’s decarbonisation goals.

The Global Maritime Forum described the adjournment as a serious setback.

“Today’s adjournment is disappointing but not the end of the journey,” said Jesse Fahnestock, the Forum’s director of decarbonisation.

“Delaying for a full year makes delivery of the sector’s decarbonisation targets even more challenging,” he added, urging member states that supported the framework in April to “reconfirm their commitment to multilateralism and continue the urgent work of developing guidelines and adopting a regulatory framework that can deliver on the IMO’s unanimously agreed GHG strategy.”

The International Chamber of Shipping (ICS) also voiced frustration that the meeting failed to deliver progress.

We came here to finally conclude a crucial climate agreement for international shipping”. She added that “geopolitical tensions and a new world order have made their way in – also at the IMO”.

Patrick Verhoeven, managing director of the International Association of Ports and Harbors, described it as “a major setback for the maritime industry,” warning that the delay “will simply open the door for more national and regional measures, which will add to an already complex regulatory patchwork resulting in unintended consequences.”

The World Shipping Council, while acknowledging the challenging negotiations, underlined the importance of using the year ahead to clarify and develop the framework. The liner industry has invested $150 billion in ships designed to run on green fuels and remains committed to net-zero by 2050.

Hon. Ralph Regenvanu, Minister for Climate Change of Vanuatu, expressed particular concern from the perspective of climate-vulnerable nations: “This is unacceptable given the urgency we face in light of accelerating climate change. The IMO’s failure to adopt the framework this week marks a failure of this United Nations agency to act decisively on climate change.”

The Trump Administration threatened retaliatory tariffs and sanctions, especially on developing and climate-vulnerable states, if they supported the framework. Delegates from many developing countries described this pressure as “bullying,” “unprecedented,” and “undiplomatic.”

U.S. Ambassador to the UN Mike Waltz and Secretary of State Marc Rubio both claimed the outcome as a victory, stating that the United States “prevented a massive UN tax hike on American consumers”.

The Net-Zero Framework includes requirements for gradual reduction of greenhouse gas intensity in marine fuels, with ships that emit more than allowed required to pay, while energy-efficient vessels can earn and trade surplus units. The delay could risk the deal not coming into force until 2030, even if adopted in a year.

The decision came after four days of tense talks in London that exposed deep rifts between oil-producing nations and countries seeking stronger climate action.

The proposed carbon-pricing plan—known as the Net Zero Framework—would have charged shipping companies for emissions exceeding set limits, with proceeds funding cleaner fuels and climate aid for vulnerable nations.

Backed by the European Union, Brazil, and several Pacific Island states, the initiative aimed to push the global shipping sector, which generates nearly 3% of worldwide greenhouse gas emissions, toward its 2050 net-zero goal.

But opposition hardened under President Donald Trump, who denounced the proposal as a “scam tax” and withdrew the U.S. from IMO negotiations in April.

Washington warned that any country supporting the plan could face sanctions, visa restrictions, or higher port fees. The State Department argued the levy would raise costs for American consumers and undermine economic competitiveness.

Carbon Tax Debate Exposes Global Fault Lines

The proposal to delay was introduced by Singapore and called to a vote by Saudi Arabia, passing narrowly with 57 countries in favor, 49 against, and 21 abstentions. The postponement pushes back the adoption of a framework that had been agreed in principle in April, when 63 countries, including the EU, China, India, Brazil, Canada, the UK, Japan, and South Korea, voted to support it.

IMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez urged delegates to avoid further breakdowns, calling the week’s proceedings “chaotic.” Observers said the impasse underscored the difficulty of achieving global consensus on climate measures that directly affect trade and energy policy.

Small island states and developing nations, some of which had planned to back the tax after initially abstaining, expressed frustration that momentum for maritime decarbonization had stalled once again.

Without a pricing system, experts warn, the shipping sector’s emissions will continue to rise, threatening global climate targets and testing the credibility of the IMO’s climate commitments.

Framework in Doubt

The NZF would require ships over 5,000 gross tons to reduce the carbon intensity of their fuels beginning in 2028, introducing a system of credits and penalties.

Vessels exceeding emission limits would purchase “remedial units”, while lower-emitting operators could trade surplus credits. Revenues would feed into an IMO Net-Zero Fund to finance low-carbon fuel adoption and assist developing nations with the transition.

While some delegates view the delay as a chance to build broader consensus, others fear it could embolden opposition and slow progress toward the shipping sector’s decarbonization goals.",https://carbonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ship-5894495_1280.png,N,,2025-10-18 00:56:18.202622

“There are no winners and losers in this session. Let us take this moment to learn from it and come back ready to negotiate and take the next steps needed to meet the goals you all agreed to in the 2023 GHG strategy.”

He asked delegates not to celebrate the adjournment. “There are concerns we need to address, let us work with each other,” he said.

A missed opportunity

UN Spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric told reporters in New York that Secretary-General António Guterres viewed the outcome as “a missed opportunity for Member States to place the shipping sector on a clear, credible path towards net-zero emissions.”

He stressed that decarbonizing the maritime sector – responsible for about 80 per cent of global trade – “is critical.”

Media reports cited opposition from several major economies – including the United States – which argued that the proposed global pricing mechanism risked functioning as a “carbon tax” and could raise shipping costs by more than 10 per cent.

With years of negotiations behind the shipping decarbonisation amendments that include the NZF, and an April 2025 vote that approved the amendments to Marpol, the move to adjourn was not widely expected.

But during a press conference following the closure of proceedings, IMO Secretary General Arsenio Dominguez said the plan was ’very much alive’.

""The framework is not adopted, but we were already working on developing the guidelines [if] the framework [had been] approved. So the amendments remain approved. The session has been adjourned to continue in one year, again, to address the adoption of the amendments,"" he said.

Asked if the adjournment was a ’blow’ to the IMO, with alleged reports from delegates that ""outside pressure [is] what dictated the outcome"" of the vote, Mr Dominguez said he did not see it that way, while noting the particular challenges and weighty geopolitical stakes that surround climate agreements.

""It wasn’t the normal meetings of IMO, but this is a topic that, you know, transcends IMO,"" he said. ""The geopolitics in the world right now makes it, as well, more challenging for us to make progress in certain topics. But I will maintain that member states have the right to express their opinion, to negotiate amongst each other. I’m not here to qualify that. I’m here to continue to work with all of them... and that’s why there’s further work, not only on the guidelines, but the negotiations that will continue to take place in between now that we have adjourned and when we resume in a year’s time.""

Pointing out that the IMO’s ""main framework"" rules on greenhouse gas emissions (GHG)remain ""the basis for any discussions,"" Mr Dominguez said the organisation can still move forward on several fronts.

""We’re still calculating and providing information annually in relation to the efficiency of shipping made on the data collection systems. The goals that remained in the 2023 IMO agenda, [they] remain there as as indicative goals,"" he said, in reference to a 2023 revision to the IMO GHG strategy that saw the organisation set target reductions for 2030, through to targeting a reduction of GHGs to net zero by or around 2050.

""And of course, with the technical measures, as I said in the past, we can still move forward in relation to the meeting the [total annual GHG reductions form shipping] of 20% and striving for 30% [by 2030]. And of course, there are many proactive actions that can take place in order to continue to incentivise the transition of shipping... and allow us to meet the other goal of uptake of alternative fuels,"" he said.

According to IMO, the 2023 IMO GHG Strategy also includes a level of ambition relating to the uptake of zero or near-zero (ZNZ) GHG emission technologies, fuels and/or energy sources which are to represent at least 5%, striving for 10%, of the energy used by international shipping by 2030.

Reactions to the delay in adopting a net-zero framework

A host of organisations published reactions to the early adjournment, without a decision, of the IMO meeting that had been expected to address and potentially set formal, binding requirements for the decarbonisation of the shipping sector over the next 25 years.

“Today’s adjournment is a disappointing setback for shipping, but not the end of this journey. The adjournment for a full year creates serious challenges for meeting the timelines in the Net-Zero Framework agreed in April and will make delivery of the sector’s decarbonisation targets even more challenging,"" director of decarbonisation for the non-profit maritime decarbonisation facilitator Global Maritime Forum (GMF) Jesse Fahnestock.

“We encourage member states that agreed on the framework in April to re-confirm their commitment to multilateralism and continue the urgent work of developing guidelines and adopting a regulatory framework that can deliver on the IMO’s unanimously agreed Greenhouse Gas Strategy,” he said.

The EU called the delay ""regrettable,"" and said it remained committed to ""an ambitious, science-based global framework"" to decarbonise shipping through a ""just, equitable"" transition.

UCL Energy Institute Professor of Energy and Transport Dr Tristan Smith said: “This is catastrophic for confidence, and therefore also for the equitable and ambitious decarbonisation we need. We will now have to double-down on other means to drive shipping GHG reduction and energy transition. Climate science tells us that the challenge of decarbonisation does not go away, it gets harder. This delay therefore means those with the means must step up and lead more than ever, until this multilateral process can regain its composure.”

ICS Secretary General Thomas A. Kazakos said his organisation is ""disappointed that member states have not been able to agree a way forward at this meeting. Industry needs clarity to be able to make the investments needed to decarbonise the maritime sector, in line with the goals set out in the IMO GHG strategy. As an industry we will continue to work with the IMO, which is the best organisation to deliver the global regulations needed for a global industry.”

New evidence shows benefits of ’stringent climate policies’

A new study by by the Euro-Mediterranean Center on Climate Change (CMCC) shows that pursuing net-zero climate policies and avoiding temporary overshoot of the 1.5°C temperature limit set in the UN’s Paris Agreement on climate change could prevent 207,000 premature deaths and save billions of dollars in economic damages by 2030 by improving air quality. The research highlights that ambitious climate action not only limits global warming but also delivers immediate health and economic ""co-benefits, providing strong evidence for the importance of stringent mitigation policies worldwide"".

""Air pollution is one of the world’s leading health risks, contributing to nearly 1 in 8 deaths globally.

“The IMO says this money pot, to be managed by agency staff, would support innovation in green shipping and ‘reward low-emission ships’,” it stated.

It continued: “That’s bad enough as an invitation to opaque special dealing and corruption. But the IMO also contemplates using the funds for ‘just-transition initiatives in developing countries’ and to ‘mitigate negative impacts’ of climate change on ‘vulnerable States’.”

The planet and the future of shipping don’t have time to waste.” Questions, comments or story ideas?","After a week of high-stakes debate and U.S.-led opposition, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) voted on Friday for a one-year delay on the adoption of its landmark Net-Zero Framework — a decision environmental groups called a major setback for global efforts to clean up shipping industry emissions.

“[The framework] represented years of negotiations, research, and collective effort,” Jenny Helle, an expert on decarbonisation of aviation and shipping at Carbon Market Watch, said in a statement. “It was a clear and urgent demand from both the industry and the public.

“Yet, due to pressure from the Trump administration and major fossil fuel producing countries, this opportunity for progress was lost.”

The maritime organization said in a brief statement on Friday that member states “will continue to work towards consensus,” using the next 12 months to bridge differences on the framework, while a technical group meets next week to keep drafting the guidelines for how it would work in practice.

Ships over limits would pay into global clean-fuel fund

The framework, drawn up in April, would have made shipping pay for its emissions. Under the plan, ships that exceed set limits would pay for their excess pollution, while vessels that perform better could trade or bank so-called “surplus units.”

Money collected through the scheme would go into a fund to support zero- and near-zero-emission fuels and technologies — particularly in developing countries and island states.

The rules would apply to ocean-going ships over 5,000 gross tonnes, which account for roughly 85 per cent of international shipping’s total CO₂ emissions. The IMO has said it wants the industry to reach carbon neutrality “by or around 2050,” with interim cuts of 20 per cent by 2030 and 70 per cent by 2040.

Concern for Arctic

The Net-Zero Framework has also been closely watched across the Arctic, where melting sea ice is opening new shipping routes and increasing traffic through fragile ecosystems.

Northern and Indigenous communities, already contending with rising coastal erosion and black carbon pollution from vessels, have often raised concerns in global forums that weaker or delayed shipping rules could deepen the climate pressures already reshaping their coasts.

Trump calls framework a “Global Green New Scam Tax.”

The IMO session, which ran from October 14–17, had been expected to end with a vote in favour of the Net-Zero Framework on Friday.

But in the days leading up to the decision, members of the U.S. administration mounted a strong campaign against the plan, arguing that the framework amounted to a global carbon tax that would raise costs for American consumers, businesses and travellers.

Officials warned the U.S. would retaliate against countries backing the proposal — including through measures like port fees, visa restrictions, sanctions and limits on ships registered in countries that supported the plan.

On Thursday, U.S. President Donald Trump took to the Truth Social platform saying he was “outraged” the vote would take place and characterizing it as a “Global Green New Scam Tax.”

Delay ‘a squandered opportunity’ say environmental groups

Environmental groups reacted sharply to the IMO’s decision, calling it a major setback for climate action.

“By delaying adoption of its Net Zero Framework, IMO has today squandered an important opportunity to tackle global shipping’s contribution to climate breakdown”, John Maggs, the Clean Shipping Coalition’s Representative at the IMO, said in a statement, warning that governments “serious about climate action” should use the next 12 months to rally support for adoption.

Others said the delay exposes how geopolitics has overtaken science in the IMO’s process.

“Emotions have run high, with once-ambitious alliances wavering and strategies eclipsing reason,” Anaïs Rios, senior shipping policy officer at Seas At Risk, said.

“With countries like Saudi Arabia leading efforts to delay, few expected a postponement to prevail — but here we are. The planet and the future of shipping don’t have time to waste.”
