Key IMO Papers:

A paper submitted to SDC 12 by WWF and presented during a lunchtime side event, SDC 12-INF.17 – Spatio-temporal information on Arctic whale migration routes for consideration in voyage planning and other measures to reduce the impacts of underwater radiated noise on marine life provides new maps that show, for the first time, the migratory corridors of Arctic whales across the Arctic Ocean.

Marine mammal migratory corridors are specified in both the URN Guidelines and the Polar Code as areas of special concern because they contain high concentrations of animals sensitive to impacts of shipping. The maps provide mariners with new information on where they need to take measures in migratory months, which in the Arctic, are in spring and autumn. Operational measures, such as rerouting and restricting speed, can reduce impacts on migrating whales, and these measures go hand in hand with technical measures to quieten ships through new builds and modifications. WWF invites mariners to use the maps in voyage planning, and urges member states and the IMO to implement location-specific rules and recommendations to reduce impacts of underwater noise in migratory corridors.

“By putting migratory corridors on the map for these three whale species that we know to be especially sensitive to underwater noise, we hope to support the shipping community to take necessary measures to safeguard them”, said Melanie Lancaster, Senior Specialist, Arctic species conservation for WWF’s Global Arctic Programme and member of the Clean Arctic Alliance. “From the maps, we see that whales migrate impressive distances between their summer and winter habitats, some swimming thousands of kilometres across national borders and even into the high seas of the Central Arctic Ocean. It will take international cooperation among states, ship operators, shipping companies and IMO to ensure their safe and quiet passage.”

The WWF paper outlines how IMO Member States should consider adopting shipping measures in the Arctic that build on the practice within IMO to safeguard whales from the adverse impacts of shipping.

Mandatory ship reporting systems and recommendatory seasonal areas to be avoided have been adopted for North Atlantic right whales along the United States east coast and recommendatory speed restrictions have been adopted as an Associated Protective Measure (APM) for whales in the North-Western Mediterranean Sea Particularly Sensitive Sea Area (PSSA). The paper provides the necessary information for similar preventative measures to be adopted to safeguard whales in the Arctic.

A paper submitted to SDC 12 by the Clean Shipping Coalition – SDC 12/8/3 and sent onto MEPC 84 for consideration, shares the findings of a study on the potential underwater radiated noise (URN) impacts of LNG development on marine mammals in the Gulf of California. The paper examines the potential effects of URN from LNG tanker traffic on migratory and resident whales, as well as related impacts on air quality and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

The proposed LNG terminals and the resulting increase in LNG tanker traffic are expected to pose serious threats to the Gulf of California’s unique biodiversity and conservation areas, including those designated as a UNESCO “World Heritage Site” and “Important Marine Mammal Areas”. These developments increase the risks of air, water, and underwater noise pollution. Given the Gulf of California’s critical ecological role—particularly as a habitat for resident and migratory marine megafauna—a precautionary approach to industrial development is essential. It is increasingly evident that the region’s ecological integrity is incompatible with the scale and nature of heavy marine traffic associated with proposed LNG facilities.

Many regions, such as in the Arctic and the Gulf of California in Mexico, share similar potential impacts from underwater noise, and both have seen low shipping traffic in the past. Shipping traffic has been increasing in the last decade in the Arctic, while in the Gulf of California the developing LNG infrastructure will bring unprecedented vessel traffic to a marine area with enormous ecological value, in particular for marine mammals.",,N,,2026-01-25 17:56:49.739302

In the still­ness of a Sat­ur­day morn­ing, a large ship docked on the wa­ter­front near the Hy­att Re­gency in Port-of-Spain. There are many ships that dock on those wa­ters week­ly, but this ves­sel presents a glimpse in­to an in­dus­try long­ing to be dis­cov­ered in this coun­try.

The Fortes­cue Green Pi­o­neer has slow­ly made its way from Belem, Brazil (where the UN Cli­mate Change Con­fer­ence took place last No­vem­ber) to the Port of Port-of-Spain. It will spend a week in T&T wa­ters. How­ev­er, the orig­i­nal sched­ule was a mere pit stop for fu­el be­fore sail­ing high­er up the Caribbean chain. That changed when in­dus­try lead­ers learned of the ves­sel’s unique­ness.

The Green Pi­o­neer is the world’s first am­mo­nia-pow­ered ves­sel, de­signed to test and demon­strate the vi­a­bil­i­ty of am­mo­nia as a ze­ro-emis­sion fu­el in the ship­ping in­dus­try. It was de­vel­oped and de­signed by the Aus­tralian min­ing com­pa­ny, Fortes­cue. In 2025, it was list­ed by Time Mag­a­zine as one of the best in­ven­tions of the year: “a sea­wor­thy so­lu­tion to ship­ping pol­lu­tion.”

The word am­mo­nia lit a bulb in the heads of Trinida­di­ans who wel­comed the ves­sel.

This coun­try is a glob­al leader in am­mo­nia pro­duc­tion and ex­ports, boast­ing eleven world-scale am­mo­nia plants with a to­tal an­nu­al ca­pac­i­ty of ap­prox­i­mate­ly 5.2 to 5.67 mil­lion met­ric tonnes. The na­tion ranks as the world’s largest net ex­porter of am­mo­nia, fre­quent­ly con­tribut­ing 15 to 20 per cent of the to­tal glob­al­ly trans­port­ed am­mo­nia. If the mar­itime in­dus­try de­cides to go in the di­rec­tion of am­mo­nia-fu­elled ves­sels, T&T is in a po­si­tion ge­o­graph­i­cal­ly and lo­gis­ti­cal­ly to be a gas sta­tion for ships in this re­gion.

Philip Julien, chair­man of Ke­nes­jay Green Lim­it­ed, who has led the coun­try’s thrust in­to low-car­bon and green hy­dro­gen as an ad­di­tion­al feed­stock for the petro­chem­i­cal sec­tor, told the Sun­day Guardian, “This re­al­ly rep­re­sents a strate­gic cross­roads that we’re at.”

He hailed these al­ter­na­tive ma­rine fu­els as “a new and emerg­ing mar­ket” that T&T has the po­ten­tial to cre­ate an in­dus­try out of. This in­cludes it be­com­ing a re­gion­al hub for both tra­di­tion­al and a va­ri­ety of low­er-car­bon ma­rine fu­els, with one ex­am­ple be­ing the pro­duc­tion, stor­age, bunker­ing, and ex­port of am­mo­nia.

Head of Ma­rine Sys­tems and Green Ship­ping at Fortes­cue, An­drew Hoare, agreed with Julien’s as­sess­ment. In an in­ter­view with the Sun­day Guardian, he said, “I think there’s a very, very sig­nif­i­cant com­mer­cial im­por­tance here. We can go to a beau­ti­ful, love­ly Caribbean is­land, but they’re not go­ing to nec­es­sar­i­ly see the rel­e­vance as much as Trinidad and To­ba­go have, be­cause you’ve got one of the most im­por­tant el­e­ments. You’ve got an in­fra­struc­ture that ex­ists to­day. It’s been around for quite some time... It’s al­ways been a key trans-ship­ment hub. It’s been a key oil-fu­elling hub. I think it’s a great op­por­tu­ni­ty.”

This week, stu­dents from var­i­ous uni­ver­si­ties will have a tour of the ship to learn about its key el­e­ments. Hoare is look­ing for­ward to this week in Trinidad. He added, “I think that’s go­ing to be one of, hope­ful­ly, the most warm­ing el­e­ments of the run to Trinidad and To­ba­go. It is to out­reach with stake­hold­ers there. I’m sure there’s go­ing to be high­er-lev­el, maybe gov­ern­ment-po­lit­i­cal types there as well, or the in­dus­try types, but I think prob­a­bly the most warm­ing will be the fact that we’re not just steer­ing the boats at the top. We are try­ing to cre­ate a mar­ket, change a mar­ket, and I think in the case of T&T, we’re try­ing to en­sure that you re­tain your po­si­tion in that mar­ket.”

They see it as an op­por­tu­ni­ty for them to show­case the work they’re do­ing in am­mo­nia-pow­ered ships. The Green Pi­o­neer re­mains the on­ly ship that has ac­tu­al­ly proven in­ter­na­tion­al move­ment us­ing am­mo­nia as a fu­el. How­ev­er, Hoare said there are small pi­lots hap­pen­ing in the ports, and their first ships don’t come out un­til the end of the year.

“I think the ex­cit­ing part of it is that it shows us a tan­gi­ble ex­am­ple of an al­ter­na­tive and emerg­ing fu­el that the world is look­ing at for the mar­itime in­dus­try,” Julien said.

Pro­man is one of the mul­ti-na­tion­al com­pa­nies in T&T pro­duc­ing am­mo­nia. In a con­ver­sa­tion with the Sun­day Busi­ness Guardian last week, its Deputy Man­ag­ing Di­rec­tor, Giselle Thomp­son, said her com­pa­ny has been us­ing methanol as a fu­el for their mar­itime ser­vices. How­ev­er, she added, “There is like­ly room in the mar­ket in terms of the mar­itime sec­tor for any fu­el that is low­er in car­bon in­ten­si­ty, as the sec­tor has to move to some of those cli­mate goals and the tar­gets put out by the In­ter­na­tion­al Mar­itime Or­gan­i­sa­tion (IMO). I’m sure there is room in the mar­ket for am­mo­nia-pow­ered ships, LNG-pow­ered ships, and methanol-pow­ered ships.”

Hoare and his team will em­bark on a Caribbean tour af­ter their T&T vis­it. When asked why this re­gion was so im­por­tant to their en­deav­ours, he an­swered, “Our group res­onates close­ly with the Caribbean states be­cause we’re very close to the South Pa­cif­ic is­land states of Aus­tralia. There are cer­tain sim­i­lar­i­ties. We’ve all seen the ter­ri­ble chal­lenges in Ja­maica last year with poor weath­er, which we could prob­a­bly say may be cli­mate-re­lat­ed. Like­wise, we see first­hand in the South Pa­cif­ic is­lands the im­pact of ris­ing sea lev­els there, with com­mu­ni­ties al­ready be­ing dis­placed. Al­though we’re more aligned and cog­nizant of the South Pa­cif­ic, I think by be­ing in the Caribbean, it gives us a chance to lis­ten and to show the ship be­yond a Pow­er­Point pre­sen­ta­tion.”

Julien be­lieves the Gov­ern­ment’s Blue­print Plan aligns with the po­ten­tial of this mar­itime in­dus­try change. How­ev­er, when ques­tioned how far in­to the fu­ture such a de­vel­op­ment could be­come a re­al­i­ty, he stat­ed, “I think the hori­zon match­es the de­vel­op­ment time. That’s the best way to put it, so this isn’t so far off that we can­not start with the de­vel­op­ment work now in or­der to de­vel­op those things that would make Trinidad a com­mer­cial­ly vi­able and at­trac­tive port of choice.”

It comes as the In­ter­na­tion­al Mar­itime Or­gan­i­sa­tion ac­tive­ly pur­sues a fu­ture for the ship­ping in­dus­try void of car­bon-emit­ting fu­els. Last Oc­to­ber, it was forced to walk back on a de­ci­sion to ini­ti­ate the world’s first glob­al car­bon pric­ing sys­tem on any in­ter­na­tion­al pol­luter - glob­al ship­ping. It was seen as a ma­jor set­back in meet­ing the mar­itime in­dus­try’s de­car­bon­i­sa­tion tar­gets. The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion in the Unit­ed States was a staunch crit­ic of the move.

How­ev­er, while the bat­tle for a net-ze­ro fu­ture rages geopo­lit­i­cal­ly, an op­por­tu­ni­ty seems to have sailed on­to T&T’s shores. The chal­lenge for every gov­ern­ment has been to see (and plan) for down the road as op­posed to ex­tract­ing the fi­nite joys of the nat­ur­al gas rich­es now. Julien, who has cham­pi­oned low-car­bon and green hy­dro­gen de­vel­op­ment in this coun­try, now sees an ad­di­tion­al op­por­tu­ni­ty for the coun­try’s eco­nom­ic ex­pan­sion.",http://www.guardian.co.tt/neo/1/icon32x32.png,N,,2026-01-25 09:56:48.287338

According to a publication from Stephenson Harwood, 2025 was a year in which maritime decarbonisation made headlines far beyond the maritime press. Provisional approval of the IMO Net Zero Framework in April and the postponement of the vote on its formal adoption in October attracted global attention.

The industry also grappled with the first verification period of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) and the first reporting period of FuelEU Maritime. The proposed extension of the UK Emissions Trading Scheme took shape through final policy decisions, and other national regulators advanced plans for national emissions regulation.

Commercially, the drive for lower GHG intensity fuels brought the industry into contact with biofuel and alternative fuels markets, and a new compliance market emerged connected to FuelEU pooling. Contractual innovation was essential throughout the year to define responsibilities and liabilities amid regulatory, commercial, and technological change.

Key Questions for Owners and Charterers

The source text outlined five key questions for the industry. The first addressed whether emissions from a vessel that left the European Economic Area (EEA) before 1 January 2024 but was still on its departure voyage on that date are within the EU ETS. Different interpretations could leave the ""shipping company"" short of required allowances.

The second question considered continuing obligations under the EU MRV and EU ETS when selling a vessel that has been trading in Europe, noting penalties for non-compliance include publication of names, financial penalties, and potential vessel expulsion.

The third question urged parties to check charterparty EU ETS provisions, as shipping companies rely on the charterparty chain to obtain EU Allowances (EUAs) required for surrender by 30 September 2025. Gaps in supply could force last-minute purchases at market highs.

The fourth question examined the implications of using biofuels to reduce GHG intensity for charterparties and fuel supply contracts. It noted that typical charterparty terms do not adequately address biofuel handling, consumption, or valuation, and that fuel must meet specific sustainability criteria for regulatory benefits.

The fifth question explored considerations for FuelEU pooling and compensation for compliance surplus in time charterparties. It highlighted that FuelEU regulations leave most pooling details to private contract, making charterparty terms critical for determining which party benefits from a surplus and how it is valued.",https://www.indexbox.io/landing/img/Default.webp,N,,2026-01-25 10:57:02.237319

Given the Gulf of California's critical ecological role—particularly as a habitat for resident and migratory marine megafauna—a precautionary approach to industrial development is essential. It is increasingly evident that the region's ecological integrity is incompatible with the scale and nature of heavy marine traffic associated with proposed LNG facilities.

Many regions, such as in the Arctic and the Gulf of California in Mexico, share similar potential impacts from underwater noise, and both have seen low shipping traffic in the past. Shipping traffic has been increasing in the last decade in the Arctic, while in the Gulf of California the developing LNG infrastructure will bring unprecedented vessel traffic to a marine area with enormous ecological value, in particular for marine mammals.

“Our recommendations to SDC 12, and to the forthcoming discussions at MEPC 84, for the Gulf of California are equally important for the Arctic as both regions could see devastating impacts from future increased shipping, especially from LNG tankers, for marine wildlife particularly sensitive to noise, like marine mammals”, said Andrew Dumbrille, Co-Founder and Director of Equal Routes - a member of both the Clean Arctic Alliance and the Clean Shipping Coalition. “The recommendations include: acknowledging the irreversible impacts of underwater noise caused by LNG tanker traffic on marine mammals' behaviours and habitat; promoting the development of ship design that takes into account the serious damage underwater noise causes to the marine habitat; and opposing LNG traffic in critical ecological marine areas because of, among others, the underwater noise pollution it causes, affecting marine mammals and other marine species. Both the Gulf of California and the Arctic are marine areas of incredible ecological, social and biodiversity importance for the planet, the impacts of increased noise would change the quality of the marine habitats irrevocably.”

The findings have been submitted to the International Maritime Organization (IMO) for review, reports Biodiesel Magazine.

The study highlights major reductions in black carbon, a form of soot released by ships that worsens air pollution, affects human health and accelerates global warming, particularly in the Arctic. Experts involved in the CLEANSHIP project reported that ships running on biodiesel, specifically B100 FAME, recorded up to an 81 per cent drop in black carbon emissions compared with those using conventional marine fuel.

The data was collected from the Uni-Tankers vessel Falstria Swan during normal sailing operations. An advanced monitoring device, developed by Green Instruments in partnership with the Danish Technological Institute, enabled continuous and real-time tracking of emissions while the ship was in regular service.

Researchers said the results were stronger than expected, especially at lower engine power levels. They noted that biodiesel not only lowers overall carbon emissions but also sharply reduces black carbon, which plays a key role in the shipping industry’s climate impact. The new monitoring technology also provided more detailed emission data than previously possible.

Officials from Uni-Tankers said the real-world findings offer valuable insight into both soot and carbon emissions linked to biodiesel use. They added that this information will help the company meet its emission reduction goals and support broader efforts to reduce pollution across the shipping sector.

Despite the positive results, the study noted that current global biofuel production is not sufficient to meet the full energy needs of the global shipping fleet. Researchers said further analysis is ongoing to identify practical ways to reduce black carbon and other emissions from ships.

The findings have been compiled into a white paper and submitted to the IMO. The document is expected to support international efforts to curb black carbon emissions, especially in sensitive regions such as the Arctic.

Infographic: Underwater Noise From Ships

London– As a meeting of the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) Sub-Committee on Ship Design and Construction (SDC 12) closes today, the Clean Arctic Alliance welcomed the clear guidance on how the IMO must reduce underwater noise pollution and its impacts, and the recommendation of a two year extension of the three-year “experience building phase” (EBP).

During SDC 12, Member States finalized a list of key technical aspects for reducing underwater noise from shipping, which will inform future policy considerations by the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) during the proposed two-year extension of the Experience Building Phase, and will be initially considered by MEPC 84 in April.

The Clean Arctic Alliance, made up of 24 not-for-profit organisations, is calling on member states to ensure the IMO continues to push for progress and action in reducing underwater noise from shipping, especially in Arctic waters where the levels of underwater noise are anticipated to nearly quadruple by 2030.

“During this week’s IMO meeting, member states agreed on clear guidance on how we must reduce underwater noise pollution and its impacts during the proposed extension of the experience building phase. At the two forthcoming MEPC meetings this year, we hope to pursue policy that will move beyond voluntary guidance”, said Sarah Bobbe, Senior Manager, Arctic Program at Ocean Conservancy, a member of both the Clean Arctic Alliance and the Clean Shipping Coalition. “So far, this work has not kept pace relative to the growing threats faced by regions experiencing increased shipping traffic, such as the Arctic, underscoring the need for parallel policy advancement through the IMO’s Marine Environmental Protection Committee in the coming months.”

For many marine organisms sound is the most important means of communication. Under water vision is restricted and without good hearing ability, elementary functions such as navigating, finding prey and partners can be hampered. This is of particular importance for marine mammals, and also for fish and even invertebrates.

“Much of the Arctic has been free of anthropogenic (human-sourced) sound for a long time, but with increased human activity, Arctic waters are becoming more noisy every year”, said Bobbe. “An important source of noise is shipping, specifically from propellers and engines. Since shipping has increased substantially during recent decades, underwater noise is a growing problem, contributing to serious impact on the Arctic ecosystem.”

Key IMO Papers:

A paper submitted to SDC 12 by WWF and presented during a lunchtime side event, SDC 12-INF.17 – Spatio-temporal information on Arctic whale migration routes for consideration in voyage planning and other measures to reduce the impacts of underwater radiated noise on marine life provides new maps that show, for the first time, the migratory corridors of Arctic whales across the Arctic Ocean.

Marine mammal migratory corridors are specified in both the URN Guidelines and the Polar Code as areas of special concern because they contain high concentrations of animals sensitive to impacts of shipping. The maps provide mariners with new information on where they need to take measures in migratory months, which in the Arctic, are in spring and autumn. Operational measures, such as rerouting and restricting speed, can reduce impacts on migrating whales, and these measures go hand in hand with technical measures to quieten ships through new builds and modifications. WWF invites mariners to use the maps in voyage planning, and urges member states and the IMO to implement location-specific rules and recommendations to reduce impacts of underwater noise in migratory corridors.

“By putting migratory corridors on the map for these three whale species that we know to be especially sensitive to underwater noise, we hope to support the shipping community to take necessary measures to safeguard them”, said Melanie Lancaster, Senior Specialist, Arctic species conservation for WWF’s Global Arctic Programme and member of the Clean Arctic Alliance. “From the maps, we see that whales migrate impressive distances between their summer and winter habitats, some swimming thousands of kilometres across national borders and even into the high seas of the Central Arctic Ocean. It will take international cooperation among states, ship operators, shipping companies and IMO to ensure their safe and quiet passage.”

The WWF paper outlines how IMO Member States should consider adopting shipping measures in the Arctic that build on the practice within IMO to safeguard whales from the adverse impacts of shipping.

Mandatory ship reporting systems and recommendatory seasonal areas to be avoided have been adopted for North Atlantic right whales along the United States east coast and recommendatory speed restrictions have been adopted as an Associated Protective Measure (APM) for whales in the North-Western Mediterranean Sea Particularly Sensitive Sea Area (PSSA). The paper provides the necessary information for similar preventative measures to be adopted to safeguard whales in the Arctic.

A paper submitted to SDC 12 by the Clean Shipping Coalition – SDC 12/8/3 and sent onto MEPC 84 for consideration, shares the findings of a study on the potential underwater radiated noise (URN) impacts of LNG development on marine mammals in the Gulf of California. The paper examines the potential effects of URN from LNG tanker traffic on migratory and resident whales, as well as related impacts on air quality and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

The proposed LNG terminals and the resulting increase in LNG tanker traffic are expected to pose serious threats to the Gulf of California’s unique biodiversity and conservation areas, including those designated as a UNESCO “World Heritage Site” and “Important Marine Mammal Areas”. These developments increase the risks of air, water, and underwater noise pollution.

Arsenio Dominguez, secretary-general of the International Maritime Organization, told a new year’s press conference in London on Friday that, even if governments don’t sign up to the framework later this year as planned, the clean-up of the industry responsible for 3% of global emissions will continue.

“I reiterate my call to industry that the decarbonisation has started. There’s lots of research and development that is ongoing. There’s new plans on alternative fuels like methanol and ammonia that continue to evolve,” he told journalists.

He said he has not heard any government dispute a set of decarbonisation goals agreed in 2023. These include targets to reduce emissions 20-30% on 2008 levels by 2030 and then to reach net zero emissions “by or around, i.e. close to 2050”.

Dominguez said the 2030 emissions reduction target could be reached, although a goal for shipping to use at least 5% clean fuels by 2030 would be difficult to meet because their cost will remain high until at least the 2030s. The goals agreed in 2023 also included cutting emissions by 70-80% by 2040.

In October 2025, a decision on a proposed framework of practical measures to achieve the goals, which aims to incentivise shipowners to go green by taxing polluting ships and subsidising cleaner ones, was postponed by a year after a narrow vote by governments.

Ahead of that vote, the US threatened governments and their officials with sanctions, tariffs and visa restrictions – and President Donald Trump called the framework a “Green New Scam Tax on Shipping”.

Dominguez said at Friday’s press conference that he had not received any official complaints about the US’s behaviour at last October’s meeting but – without naming names – he called on nations to be “more respectful” at the IMO. He added that he did not think the US would leave the IMO, saying Washington had engaged constructively on the organisation’s budget and plans.

EU urged to clarify ETS position

The European Union – along with Brazil and Pacific island nations – pushed hard for the framework to be adopted in October. Some developing countries were concerned that the EU would retain its charges for polluting ships under its emissions trading scheme (ETS), even if the Net Zero Framework was passed, leading to ships travelling to and from the EU being charged twice.

This was an uncertainty that the US and Saudi Arabia exploited at the meeting to try and win over wavering developing countries. Most African, Asian and Caribbean nations voted for a delay.

On Friday, Dominguez called on the EU “to clarify their position on the review of the ETS, in order that as we move forward, we actually don’t have two systems that are going to be basically looking for the same the same goal, the same objective.”

He said he would continue to speak to EU member states, “to maintain the conversations in here, rather than move forward into fragmentation, because that will have a very detrimental effect in shipping”. “That would really create difficulties for operators, that would increase the cost, and everybody’s going to suffer from it,” he added.

To prevent coral reef bleaching, greenhouse gas emissions need to be reduced, which lowers global warming, which further triggers the bleaching.","Environmentalists worldwide were elated when the decision to reduce sulfur from shipping fuels was announced. However, the call has had some worrisome aftereffects, as published in the journal Communications Earth and Environment. The study claims that it has enhanced a coral bleaching event on the Great Barrier Reef. This event took place back in the early months of 2022, when the reduction of sulfur emissions from the ship allowed more than typical amounts of sunlight to reach the reef. This elevation led to 10% more heat stress on the corals of the Great Barrier Reef during the mass bleaching event. It was the first bleaching event to unfold in a La Niña year.

The limitation was put into effect by the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) 2020 regulation. As per this regulation, the sulfur content in the marine fuels was reduced from 3.5% to 0.5%. This decision proved to be fruitful, as it reduced harmful sulfur emissions and improved air quality. However, it also hampered a cooling effect in the atmosphere and particularly Australia’s Great Barrier Reef. In this cooling phenomenon, sulfur becomes a sort of layer that prevents some amount of sunlight from reaching the surface. Reduction of sulfur from the fuel led to less of this element in the atmosphere. This weakened the layer, causing more sunlight than before to reach the surface.

To make the assertions, researchers considered the ship data of the region from 18 to 28 February 2022. During this time, 5,000 ships supposedly moved in the Great Barrier Reef. The heat was progressively building up on the reef at that time. After gathering the data, they created computer models to figure out the amount of sulfur emission in the setup with the regulation, and what it would have been without it. The models essentially try to shed light on how sulfur particles emitted from the vessels drifted over the reef, and the cooling it facilitated.

The team also evaluated the weather conditions at the site to understand how sulfur moved in the air. Past observations had revealed that prevailing winds in the region blow the sulfur from above the reef. The results indicated that 5% to 10% more solar energy was hitting the reef’s waters with regulations than it would have without limitations. Researchers believe that the increased amount of sunlight, due to reduced sulfur emissions from the vessels, intensified the 2022 coral bleaching event on the Great Barrier Reef. The intensification is dangerous as it further hampers the marine ecosystem.

This is not an isolated event. The cooling effect occurs worldwide, and hence the removal of sulfur also increases temperatures across the globe, due to an enhanced amount of sunlight. Professor Steven Sherwood, a climate scientist at the University of New South Wales, not involved in the research, shared that the removal of sulfur aerosols from the atmosphere due to reduced emissions elevated the global temperatures by 32F. “This new study points out that while the overall effect on climate is small, the local effect on ocean temperatures in the tropics can be larger. This is because the air pollution absorbs some sunlight in addition to reflection to space,” Sherwood said, per The Guardian.

“Thus, they find a bigger effect, maybe up to 0.15 °C (32.27 °F), which is enough to increase the heat stress on the corals as reported. This is an important result since it shows the impact on corals might be nontrivial even though the overall global warming impact is pretty small,” Sherwood added. Despite the intensification of coral reef bleaching, experts do not think that the regulations should be called back. Reduction of sulfur pollution is essential for safeguarding human health. To prevent coral reef bleaching, greenhouse gas emissions need to be reduced, which lowers global warming, which further triggers the bleaching.

This demonstrates that biodiesel can reduce not only net CO₂, but also Black Carbon, which is highly significant for the shipping sector’s total climate footprint.
Although biodiesel demonstrates a significant reduction in Black Carbon, current global production of biofuel can only cover a small share of the global fleet’s total energy demand.
Therefore, the Cleanship project continues to analyse data and work towards recommendations on how Black Carbon and other emissions can be effectively reduced in shipping.
This documentation will contribute to the international efforts to reduce Black Carbon emissions – especially in Arctic regions, where soot particles have a particularly significant climate impact on ice and the environment.","New Danish data, collected during real-world sailing, documents significant climate benefits from biofuel for the shipping industry. The findings have been submitted to the International Maritime Organization (IMO).

Soot particles – also known as black carbon – are among the most harmful emissions from shipping, both for the climate, where they contribute to global warming and melting of Arctic ice, and for public health through poor air quality. Now, experts from the CLEANSHIP project document that using biodiesel, specifically B100 FAME, during normal operation can reduce Black Carbon emissions by up to 81 percent compared to traditional marine gas oil (MGO).

The measurements were carried out on the Uni-Tankers vessel Falstria Swan, where an advanced online Black Carbon sensor from Green Instruments, developed in collaboration with Danish Technological Institute, made it possible to track emissions in detail and in real time during the vessel’s normal operation.

“We expected that biofuel would lead to cleaner combustion, but the magnitude of the reduction – especially at lower engine loads – is a very positive surprise. This demonstrates that biodiesel can reduce not only net CO₂, but also Black Carbon, which is highly significant for the shipping sector’s total climate footprint. At the same time, the measurement technology allows us to monitor emissions with much greater detail than ever before,” says Simon Bastrup Spangenberg, consultant and measurement specialist in alternative fuels and emission reduction at Danish Technological Institute.

For Uni-Tankers, the measurements translate directly into new, practical knowledge:

“The latest real-world sailing data on biodiesel (B100) give us a clear picture of both the black carbon footprint and actual CO₂ emissions. This insight is crucial for achieving our own reduction targets, while also contributing to better, data-driven recommendations for reducing emissions across the shipping industry,” says Troels Reppien, Technical Director at Uni-Tankers.

Although biodiesel demonstrates a significant reduction in Black Carbon, current global production of biofuel can only cover a small share of the global fleet’s total energy demand. Therefore, the Cleanship project continues to analyse data and work towards recommendations on how Black Carbon and other emissions can be effectively reduced in shipping.

The results from the measurement campaign have now been submitted to the International Maritime Organization (IMO) in the form of a white paper. This documentation will contribute to the international efforts to reduce Black Carbon emissions – especially in Arctic regions, where soot particles have a particularly significant climate impact on ice and the environment. The white paper is scheduled for consideration at IMO’s 13th session of the Sub-Committee on Pollution Prevention and Response (PPR), which will take place from 9–13 February 2026.",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Danish_Maritime_Jan26_678a24ca4c.jpg,N,,2026-01-23 11:56:47.622884

The association recalls that it accepted the inclusion of shipping in the ETS on the condition that revenues would be reinvested in decarbonising the sector and that road transport would soon follow.
However, the recent decision by the Council to continue exempting road transport has raised serious concerns, as end users of maritime transport — including island communities — are being asked to shoulder the cost unilaterally.
“Excluding road transport creates an immediate and serious competitive disadvantage for ferries,” said Interferry Director of Regulatory Affairs Johan Rous.
“The current approach neither strengthens competitiveness nor cohesion and limits the sector’s ability to invest in cleaner technologies,” Rous said.","Interferry, the global association representing the ferry industry, is calling for an immediate freeze on the further application of the European Union’s Emissions Trading System (ETS) to shipping, warning that the current framework creates serious competitive distortions and risks shifting passengers and freight back to Europe’s already congested road networks.

The organisation urges the EU to keep the obligation to surrender emission allowances at the 70% level applied in 2025 and to suspend the planned increase to 100% from 2026, until road transport is also included in the ETS and a clear framework is established for channeling revenues towards the decarbonisation of shipping.

“The EU must honour its promise of a level playing field and ensure that climate policy supports, rather than financially drains, the most progressive transport sector,” said Interferry CEO Mike Corrigan, stressing that the measure should remain on hold until road transport is incorporated into the system.

The ferry sector plays a critical role in European transport, with more than 50% of the world’s RoRo and passenger vessel fleet operating in European waters, carrying around 400 million passengers and 200 million vehicles and freight units annually within the EU. According to Interferry, any increase in fares due to ETS costs risks pushing freight back onto roads, undermining Europe’s long-standing strategy of shifting transport from land to sea.

The association recalls that it accepted the inclusion of shipping in the ETS on the condition that revenues would be reinvested in decarbonising the sector and that road transport would soon follow. However, the recent decision by the Council to continue exempting road transport has raised serious concerns, as end users of maritime transport — including island communities — are being asked to shoulder the cost unilaterally.

“Excluding road transport creates an immediate and serious competitive disadvantage for ferries,” said Interferry Director of Regulatory Affairs Johan Rous. “The ETS, as applied today, encourages the transfer of passengers and freight back to roads, directly contradicting Europe’s long-standing policy of shifting transport from land to sea.”

At the same time, the International Maritime Organization’s decision in October 2025 to postpone the adoption of a global carbon pricing mechanism for at least 12 months leaves the sector without a clear international framework and without certainty over when — or if — a unified system will be implemented.

According to Interferry, the ETS currently imposes an annual burden of around €1 billion on intra-European ferry services, at a time when the sector requires support for the production of e-fuels and major investments in port electrification to serve electric-powered vessels. Instead, the organisation says, most of the revenues are being channelled into national budgets of member states.

“The current approach neither strengthens competitiveness nor cohesion and limits the sector’s ability to invest in cleaner technologies,” Rous said.

Interferry, which has more than 280 members in over 40 countries, is calling on European authorities to reassess the policy to ensure that the green transition in shipping is accompanied by equal competitive conditions and genuine reinvestment of resources in the sector’s decarbonisation.",https://money-tourism.gr/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/azamara-cruises.png,N,,2026-01-23 11:56:43.934796

“During this week’s IMO meeting, member states agreed on clear guidance on how we must reduce underwater noise pollution and its impacts during the proposed extension of the experience building phase.
At the two forthcoming MEPC meetings this year, we hope to pursue policy that will move beyond voluntary guidance”, said Sarah Bobbe, Senior Manager, Arctic Program at Ocean Conservancy, a member of both the Clean Arctic Alliance and the Clean Shipping Coalition.
These developments increase the risks of air, water, and underwater noise pollution.
Many regions, such as in the Arctic and the Gulf of California in Mexico, share similar potential impacts from underwater noise, and both have seen low shipping traffic in the past.","As a meeting of the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) Sub-Committee on Ship Design and Construction (SDC 12) closes, the Clean Arctic Alliance welcomed the clear guidance on how the IMO must reduce underwater noise pollution and its impacts, and the recommendation of a two year extension of the three-year “experience building phase” (EBP).

During SDC 12, Member States finalized a list of key technical aspects for reducing underwater noise from shipping, which will inform future policy considerations by the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) during the proposed two-year extension of the Experience Building Phase, and will be initially considered by MEPC 84 in April.

The Clean Arctic Alliance, made up of 24 not-for-profit organizations, is calling on member states to ensure the IMO continues to push for progress and action in reducing underwater noise from shipping, especially in Arctic waters where the levels of underwater noise are anticipated to nearly quadruple by 2030.

“During this week’s IMO meeting, member states agreed on clear guidance on how we must reduce underwater noise pollution and its impacts during the proposed extension of the experience building phase. At the two forthcoming MEPC meetings this year, we hope to pursue policy that will move beyond voluntary guidance”, said Sarah Bobbe, Senior Manager, Arctic Program at Ocean Conservancy, a member of both the Clean Arctic Alliance and the Clean Shipping Coalition. “So far, this work has not kept pace relative to the growing threats faced by regions experiencing increased shipping traffic, such as the Arctic, underscoring the need for parallel policy advancement through the IMO’s Marine Environmental Protection Committee in the coming months.”

For many marine organisms sound is the most important means of communication. Under water vision is restricted and without good hearing ability, elementary functions such as navigating, finding prey and partners can be hampered. This is of particular importance for marine mammals, and also for fish and even invertebrates.

“Much of the Arctic has been free of anthropogenic (human-sourced) sound for a long time, but with increased human activity, Arctic waters are becoming more noisy every year”, said Bobbe. “An important source of noise is shipping, specifically from propellers and engines. Since shipping has increased substantially during recent decades, underwater noise is a growing problem, contributing to serious impact on the Arctic ecosystem.”

A paper submitted to SDC 12 by WWF and presented during a lunchtime side event, SDC 12-INF.17 – Spatio-temporal information on Arctic whale migration routes for consideration in voyage planning and other measures to reduce the impacts of underwater radiated noise on marine life provides new maps that show, for the first time, the migratory corridors of Arctic whales across the Arctic Ocean.

Marine mammal migratory corridors are specified in both the URN Guidelines and the Polar Code as areas of special concern because they contain high concentrations of animals sensitive to impacts of shipping. The maps provide mariners with new information on where they need to take measures in migratory months, which in the Arctic, are in spring and autumn. Operational measures, such as rerouting and restricting speed, can reduce impacts on migrating whales, and these measures go hand in hand with technical measures to quieten ships through new builds and modifications. WWF invites mariners to use the maps in voyage planning, and urges member states and the IMO to implement location-specific rules and recommendations to reduce impacts of underwater noise in migratory corridors.

“By putting migratory corridors on the map for these three whale species that we know to be especially sensitive to underwater noise, we hope to support the shipping community to take necessary measures to safeguard them”, said Melanie Lancaster, Senior Specialist, Arctic species conservation for WWF’s Global Arctic Program and member of the Clean Arctic Alliance. “From the maps, we see that whales migrate impressive distances between their summer and winter habitats, some swimming thousands of kilometers across national borders and even into the high seas of the Central Arctic Ocean. It will take international cooperation among states, ship operators, shipping companies and IMO to ensure their safe and quiet passage.”

The WWF paper outlines how IMO Member States should consider adopting shipping measures in the Arctic that build on the practice within IMO to safeguard whales from the adverse impacts of shipping.

Mandatory ship reporting systems and recommendatory seasonal areas to be avoided have been adopted for North Atlantic right whales along the United States east coast and recommendatory speed restrictions have been adopted as an Associated Protective Measure (APM) for whales in the North-Western Mediterranean Sea Particularly Sensitive Sea Area (PSSA). The paper provides the necessary information for similar preventative measures to be adopted to safeguard whales in the Arctic.

A paper submitted to SDC 12 by the Clean Shipping Coalition - SDC 12/8/3 and sent onto MEPC 84 for consideration, shares the findings of a study on the potential underwater radiated noise (URN) impacts of LNG development on marine mammals in the Gulf of California. The paper examines the potential effects of URN from LNG tanker traffic on migratory and resident whales, as well as related impacts on air quality and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

The proposed LNG terminals and the resulting increase in LNG tanker traffic are expected to pose serious threats to the Gulf of California's unique biodiversity and conservation areas, including those designated as a UNESCO ""World Heritage Site"" and ""Important Marine Mammal Areas"". These developments increase the risks of air, water, and underwater noise pollution. Given the Gulf of California's critical ecological role—particularly as a habitat for resident and migratory marine megafauna—a precautionary approach to industrial development is essential. It is increasingly evident that the region's ecological integrity is incompatible with the scale and nature of heavy marine traffic associated with proposed LNG facilities.

Many regions, such as in the Arctic and the Gulf of California in Mexico, share similar potential impacts from underwater noise, and both have seen low shipping traffic in the past. Shipping traffic has been increasing in the last decade in the Arctic, while in the Gulf of California the developing LNG infrastructure will bring unprecedented vessel traffic to a marine area with enormous ecological value, in particular for marine mammals.

“Our recommendations to SDC 12, and to the forthcoming discussions at MEPC 84, for the Gulf of California are equally important for the Arctic as both regions could see devastating impacts from future increased shipping, especially from LNG tankers, for marine wildlife particularly sensitive to noise, like marine mammals”, said Andrew Dumbrille, Co-Founder and Director of Equal Routes - a member of both the Clean Arctic Alliance and the Clean Shipping Coalition. “The recommendations include: acknowledging the irreversible impacts of underwater noise caused by LNG tanker traffic on marine mammals' behaviors and habitat; promoting the development of ship design that takes into account the serious damage underwater noise causes to the marine habitat; and opposing LNG traffic in critical ecological marine areas because of, among others, the underwater noise pollution it causes, affecting marine mammals and other marine species. Both the Gulf of California and the Arctic are marine areas of incredible ecological, social and biodiversity importance for the planet, the impacts of increased noise would change the quality of the marine habitats irrevocably.”",https://www.ajot.com/images/uploads/article/_large/underwater_noise_1.png,N,,2026-01-23 08:56:46.004758

Attachment Green Methanol Ships Market","Dublin, Jan. 23, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The ""Green Methanol Ships Market - Global Industry Size, Share, Trends, Opportunity, and Forecast, 2021-2031"" has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The Global Green Methanol Ships Market is projected to expand from USD 5.21 Billion in 2025 to USD 12.67 Billion by 2031, registering a CAGR of 15.96%.

These vessels utilize methanol derived from renewable feedstocks, such as biomass or captured carbon dioxide mixed with green hydrogen, offering a sustainable substitute for traditional heavy fuel oil. The market is primarily driven by strict international decarbonization mandates, including the International Maritime Organization's emission reduction targets, alongside the shipping industry's voluntary pursuit of net-zero operations. According to the Methanol Institute, in 2025, the global fleet of methanol-fueled vessels, including those on order, exceeded 360 units, highlighting the sector's rapid shift toward alternative propulsion technologies to comply with tightening environmental regulations.

Despite this growth, the market faces significant hurdles regarding the scalability of fuel production and supply infrastructure. A major obstacle hindering broader expansion is the high production cost and limited availability of green methanol compared to fossil-based alternatives, which creates economic uncertainty for fleet operators attempting to secure long-term supply contracts.

Market Drivers

The surge in newbuild orders for methanol-powered vessels acts as a primary catalyst for market growth, creating a guaranteed demand baseline that forces stakeholders to accelerate the transition from fossil fuels. This momentum is particularly strong in the container segment, where major carriers are aggressively renewing fleets to hedge against future regulatory costs and secure early-mover advantages. According to DNV's 'Alternative Fuels Insights' from January 2025, methanol gained substantial traction with 166 orders in 2024, accounting for 32% of the alternative fuel orderbook. This robust contracting activity is validated by the operational reality of the technology; the Global Maritime Forum's 'From Pilots to Practice' report in August 2025 noted that the sector has moved beyond testing, with more than 60 methanol-capable vessels already in operation demonstrating technical viability.

Parallel to fleet expansion, increasing investments in green methanol production capacity are critical in resolving fuel availability bottlenecks. Energy developers are scaling up renewable fuel projects globally to meet the shipping industry's demand signals, ensuring long-term supply security and price stability. According to the Methanol Institute's November 2025 'Renewable Methanol' database update, the global project pipeline has expanded to track 252 renewable methanol projects with a total anticipated capacity of 45.1 million metric tons by 2030. This infrastructure expansion is vital for ensuring that the growing number of dual-fuel vessels can operate on green methanol rather than conventional fuels, thereby enabling the industry to meet its decarbonization targets.

Market Challenges

The limited scalability of green methanol production and associated high costs present a substantial barrier to market progression. While the maritime industry is seeing a surge in vessel orders, the supply chain for the necessary renewable fuel remains underdeveloped and financially restrictive. This discrepancy creates a volatile economic environment where fleet operators face elevated operational expenditures compared to those relying on fossil-based alternatives. Consequently, the uncertainty surrounding the consistent availability of green methanol prevents shipping companies from securing viable long-term supply contracts, introducing significant financial risk to their decarbonization strategies.

This supply-demand imbalance acts as a direct brake on broader commercial adoption, as the infrastructure required to produce and bunker green methanol globally is not expanding fast enough to match growing fleet capacity. According to the Methanol Institute, in 2024, the project pipeline for renewable methanol exceeded 21 million metric tons of potential annual capacity, yet the actual volume available for immediate maritime use remained critically low due to delayed final investment decisions. This gap between planned capacity and deliverable fuel highlights the logistical constraints that currently hinder the market's ability to support a full-scale transition.

Market Trends

The Rising Dominance of Asian Shipyards in Methanol Vessel Construction is reshaping the market, as regional builders leverage immense capacity to secure the majority of dual-fuel contracts. This trend is driven by their ability to offer competitive pricing and rapid delivery slots for complex vessels, effectively centralizing the global supply chain in Asia. According to Seatrade Maritime's January 2025 report, Chinese shipyards booked 74% of all newbuilding orders in 2024, with green vessel orders specifically accounting for 78.5% of the global market share. As a result, this manufacturing monopoly is increasingly influencing global procurement strategies and technical standards for methanol-powered fleets.

Simultaneously, the Diversification of Vessel Types Beyond Container Ships is accelerating as regulatory pressure expands to broader maritime sectors. While container lines initially led adoption, bulk carriers and cruise vessels are now aggressively integrating methanol propulsion to meet strict carbon intensity ratings. According to Marine Link in April 2025, this shift was evident as methanol led activity with 12 new orders in a single month, expanding specifically into cruise and car carrier segments. This sectoral broadening reduces reliance on a single vessel class, indicating a maturing technology stack suitable for varied operational profiles.

On the newly published report,“Fuel demand aggregation”, the Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller Center for Zero Carbon Shipping (MMMCZCS) has explored fuel demand aggregation to understand whether consolidating demand across multiple offtakers can help overcome the challenges faced by fuel producers and maritime end-users.

The work is based on previous studies and more than 40 interviews with MMMCZCS partners and other relevant stakeholders across the maritime value chain. As explained, producers need bankable offtake agreements to secure funding and financing for fuel production plants.

These agreements would enable the supply of low-emissions fuels at the volumes that are required to transform the sector.

However, the maritime sector is unaccustomed to such long-term offtake agreements and is a highly fragmented industry, with diverse vessel types, ownership structures, and operating models, which complicate coordinated action and investment.

This mismatch creates a stalemate: no investment from offtakers due to uncertain supply, and no supply because producers lack secured offtake.

Stakeholders must adopt innovative approaches to break this stalemate and enable investment that supports the broader deployment of low-emissions fuels in the mid- to long-term.

…the report highlights.

Fuel demand aggregation in the maritime sector

The maritime sector needs reliable access to low-emissions fuels to meet international decarbonization ambitions. Today, the sector’s access is limited and complex because the market for low-emissions fuels is immature and lacks liquidity.

At the same time, regulations and first-mover strategies are pushing for a faster shift away from fossil fuels. Current maritime access to low-emissions fuels faces volume-related challenges: small, geographically dispersed volumes that are likely to grow slowly without support.

This fragmentation makes it difficult for producers to commit to investment and for the sector to scale up. Funding and financing support are critical to accelerate adoption, a need confirmed through the Center’s work on green corridors.

MMMCZCS research, has identified fuel demand aggregation as a potential pathway to make low-emissions fuels more accessible for the maritime sector and to reduce obstacles across the value chain.

Aggregation as a pathway to maritime decarbonization

Aggregating fuel demand means pooling fragmented volumes from multiple offtakers until a producer’s minimum volume threshold (anchor volume) is reached. This unlocks viable and cost-effective fuel production and enables the maritime sector to transition collectively during the early years of low liquidity in the low-emissions fuels market.

More concise

What aggregation does – and doesn’t solve

While aggregating fuel demand helps address quantity challenges for the upstream players in the emerging low-emissions fuel market, it does not solve individual ability to pay. Participation still requires a viable business case.

This publication addresses a critical gap in maritime safety guidance by providing the industry’s first comprehensive resource dedicated specifically to deck operations. Together with the widely used Bridge Procedures Guide and Engine Room Procedures Guide, this new publication completes a trilogy of core resources designed to harmonise best practice across all shipboard departments.

While these three guides provide essential, department-specific procedures, they form part of ICS’s broader portfolio of safety publications that support shipowners and operators worldwide.

Covering the full spectrum of deck-side activities, the guide includes practical procedures for cargo operations, mooring and anchoring, bunkering, heavy weather preparations, and maintenance of core equipment across all ship types.

It also features guidance on compliance with the International Maritime Solid Bulk Cargoes (IMSBC) Code and the International Maritime Dangerous Goods (IMDG) Code, as well as an interactive risk assessment tool and adaptable checklists to support safe and efficient operations. One chapter addresses the emerging challenge of alternative fuel bunkering, including LNG, methanol, and ammonia, developed in collaboration with leading operators and reviewed by the Society for Gas as Marine Fuel (SGMF).

“Deck operations are fundamental to ship safety, and crews need clear, validated procedures for every scenario they face,” said John Stawpert, Principal Director – Marine at the International Chamber of Shipping.

“This guide delivers that comprehensive knowledge, from traditional practices to new considerations such as alternative fuels, helping crews operate confidently while maintaining the highest safety standards.”

The Deck Procedures Guide has been developed through a rigorous review process involving representatives from Swire Shipping, Anglo-Eastern Univan Group, Japanese Shipowners Association, MISC Group, Intercargo, and CLIA. It provides structured guidance for all key deck operations, supported by practical checklists and risk assessment tools that help identify and mitigate hazards before they occur. The content is designed to be adaptable, enabling organisations to tailor procedures to their specific operational needs while ensuring compliance with international codes.

The guide is designed as an invaluable tool for masters, chief officers, deck officers, bosuns and other members of deck crew, as well as engineering officers responsible for deck machinery and crew involved in bunkering operations. ICS recommends that a copy is carried on board every ship.

It also serves ship superintendents, technical superintendents, HSEQ managers, shipping company shoreside safety teams, training institutions, terminal operators, and organisations transitioning to alternative fuel operations.

“Every onboard department needs to work together to ensure the safety and security of the crew, ship, environment and cargo,” commented Emily Yates, Commercial Director at the International Chamber of Shipping.

“The Deck Procedures Guide complements the Bridge and Engine Room Procedures Guides, creating a harmonised set of resources that uphold best practice across ship operations. While aligned for consistency, each guide is tailored to its audience, ensuring masters, engineers, and deck crews receive guidance directly relevant to their responsibilities. These guides work together to improve operational coordination and inter-departmental communication throughout the vessel, alongside ICS’s broader portfolio of safety publications.”

The Deck Procedures Guide offers an international alternative to region-specific guidance, reducing deck deficiencies while enhancing safety standards and port state control confidence. The guide emphasises best practice approaches rather than regulatory mandates, providing practical guidance applicable to today’s diverse global fleet.

Baltic Exchange on Tuesday (13 January) released an article by Carly Fields discussing methanol as a marine fuel, availability of low-GHG methanol and challenges in the development of e-methanol:

In the race to re-fuel the shipping industry with environmental alternatives to heavy fuel oil, methanol has its staunch supporters. The greener, leaner fuel also has a firm foundation to build on.

Marius Leisner, senior principal consultant in the Environmental Advisory unit at DNV, said methanol boasts a “ten-year track record as a marine fuel”, which provides a level of comfort that other alternatives, such as ammonia or hydrogen, currently lack. This equates to a robust technological foundation, with ship designs and fuel-system integration strategies having matured significantly through the recent influx of methanol-capable vessels in the global order book.

One of the primary drivers behind the mounting interest in methanol is its relative ease of handling. In a world where gaseous fuels present significant logistical and safety hurdles, methanol’s liquid state is a distinct advantage, Leisner notes.

“Being a liquid, methanol is simpler and, I would say, safer to store, transport, and bunker than gaseous fuels such as LNG, ammonia, and hydrogen.”

Furthermore, its volumetric energy intensity compares favourably to other green alternatives, being “similar to ammonia and higher than hydrogen”.

Historically, the adoption of methanol has been driven by local environmental compliance rather than global carbon reduction. Early pioneers used it to meet stringent sulphur and nitrogen oxide standards. As Leisner explained: “Methanol is sulphur-free and fully complies with MARPOL Annex VI SOx standards”.

Low-GHG methanol drive

But while it burns cleanly, generating “very little soot or particulate matter,” it is not a silver bullet for greenhouse gases in its conventional form. When produced from fossil sources, methanol’s “total well-to-wake GHG intensity is generally worse than fuel oil, Leisner said. The true promise lies in the transition to bio-methanol and e-methanol, which “can be produced from non-fossil sources with near-zero well-to-wake emissions”. However, the current landscape reveals a significant gap between capability and practice. Leisner points out that “most vessels capable of using methanol today still operate on fuel oil or fossil methanol, with only limited uptake of low-GHG methanol”.

The availability of low-GHG methanol is currently the bottleneck of the movement. While the world’s production capacity for green methanol sits at approximately 2.2 million tonnes per year—98% of which is bio-methanol—the actual bunkering volumes reported since 2023 remain “far lower” than this capacity. This suggests that while the fuel exists, the market mechanisms to put it into tanks are lagging. There is, however, cause for optimism on the horizon. If current investment decisions hold, “production capacity could increase to around 14 million tonnes by 2030, mainly driven by projects in China”, Leisner said.

Infrastructure is one area where methanol benefits from a head start. It is already one of the most widely shipped chemical commodities on the planet, with storage capacity existing in “over 115 ports worldwide”. The logistical chain is further strengthening as “dedicated methanol bunkering vessels are also emerging, with 12 currently in operation and six more on order”, Leisner said. From this perspective, the physical infrastructure is largely ready; the challenge is the price tag.

“Fundamentally, it comes down to fuel cost,” he said.

The economic gulf between fossil fuels and green alternatives remains vast. In 2025, bio-methanol prices in Rotterdam were recorded at roughly “three times the cost of marine gas oil”.

While organisations like the Methanol Institute and IRENA project that prices could fall significantly by 2050 as technology scales, the immediate future requires more than just hope for lower costs.

e-Methanol hurdles

The development of e-methanol, which utilises renewable electricity and captured carbon, faces even steeper hurdles. Currently, e-methanol accounts for only about 2% of green methanol production because it is “difficult to compete on cost today”, Leisner said. The low energy efficiency in converting green electricity into fuel remains the fundamental technical conundrum for all e-fuels. Despite this, a large portion of the future production pipeline is dedicated to e-methanol, as its ability to “approach zero GHG intensity” may justify its premium price under stricter future regulations.

To bridge this economic divide, the industry is looking toward regulators to provide the necessary “carrot” or “stick.” DNV’s modelling suggests that without strong intervention, methanol-capable ships will simply continue to burn fossil fuels to protect their bottom lines.

Leisner states that scaling will require “stronger and more sustained demand signals, such as long-term offtake agreements with defined prices and volumes, to give producers confidence to invest”.

The regulatory landscape is currently made up of two key frameworks. The FuelEU Maritime initiative provides an “important but limited demand signal”, with projected methanol use rising to between five and twelve million tonnes by 2040. In contrast, the IMO’s Net-Zero Framework represents a much more aggressive path. Under this framework, uptake is much faster, reaching 20 to 50 million tonnes. However, the recent decision to postpone the implementation of the IMO framework has left many in the industry, including DNV, feeling frustrated. Leisner admits that “a decision providing certainty would have been very helpful”.

The future of methanol in shipping is essentially a race against time and policy. The technological readiness is “largely there”, Leisner said, with major engine manufacturers like Wärtsilä and MAN already having accumulated hundreds of thousands of running hours on methanol systems. The order book is healthy, with approximately 370 methanol-capable vessels set to join the global fleet.

What remains missing is the economic bridge that allows shipowners to choose the green option without compromising their commercial viability. As Leisner concludes, the transition depends on how much of the fleet’s capacity is “actually used for low-GHG methanol rather than fossil fuels”. Until the price of carbon or the incentives for green fuel reach a tipping point, methanol will remain a promising solution waiting for the market to catch up to its potential.

Interferry points out that ferry services are critically important to Europe, with more than half of the world’s gross RoRo- and passenger ship tonnage operating in European waters, transporting 400 million passengers and 200 million vehicles and freight units every year within the EU, significantly offloading the road network. Every euro of freight rate increase on ferries risks pushing freight volumes back to the already congested European road networks.

Interferry supports decarbonisation of the maritime industry but says it accepted the EU ETS on the clear understanding that funds collected would actually be used for decarbonisation and that road transport would also soon be included.

“This exemption of road transport from the EU ETS creates an immediate, severe competitive disadvantage for RoRo and passenger ferries,” says Johan Roos, Director Regulatory Affairs of Interferry.

“As it stands now, ETS creates an adverse incentive, pushing goods and passengers back onto already congested road networks due to higher ferry costs. This directly contradicts the long-standing EU policy of modal shift from road to sea.”

Furthermore, in October 2025 the IMO postponed the adoption of a global Greenhouse Gas (GHG) pricing mechanism (as part of its Net Zero Framework) for at least 12 months – a framework that was intended to replace the EU ETS and would have set clear guidelines for the use of the funds collected. Meanwhile, Interferry points out that its members operating to and from EU ports are taxed for their CO2 emissions without a clear provision on how the money is reinvested to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, and without certainty when a global IMO regulation will come into force – if at all.

“The EU ETS is taxing intra-EU ferry transport by approximately one billion euros per year,” adds Roos, “while we need support for production of e-fuels and substantial investments in electrification of EU ports for the benefit of charging electric-propulsion ships. Instead, the vast majority of these revenues are being diverted to national Member State budgets. This approach neither promotes competitivity nor cohesion and hinders the industry’s ability to invest in cleaner technologies.”",https://cyprusshippingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/New-Project-13-3.jpg,N,,2026-01-23 00:56:57.030656

The 200-metric-ton green methanol fuel was loaded onto the international container ship COSCO Shipping Carnation by the 7,500-ton bunkering ship Daqing 268 at Yantian Port.

With a length of 109.9 meters and a total capacity of 10,362 cubic meters, Daqing 268 features a dual-fuel system capable of handling both conventional fuel and green methanol.

The inaugural operation marks a breakthrough in green fuel bunkering capability in the Greater Bay Area and lays a solid foundation for the region to develop into a world-class green shipping hub, an official from the Shenzhen Maritime Safety Administration said.

""The successful bunkering of green methanol is a significant milestone for Shenzhen Port's transition to green shipping and reflects the country's proactive commitment to carbon reduction targets. It also represents a major advancement in supporting the industry's response to the European Union's carbon tariffs,"" said Wang Guowen, director of the center for logistics and supply chain management at the China Development Institute, a think tank based in Shenzhen. ""The emphasis on green fuels in shipping is expected to become an important direction for China's future green energy transition.""

The green methanol used for bunkering was supplied by a production facility of CIMC Enric in Zhanjiang, Guangdong province. The facility, which commenced operations last month, is the first biomethanol project in China to achieve mass production, with an initial annual capacity of 50,000 tons.

The shipping industry, which accounts for over 80 percent of global trade volume, is a major contributor to environmental pollution. According to the International Maritime Organization, the sector emits about 1 billion tons of carbon dioxide annually, representing roughly 3 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions.

Green methanol can significantly reduce emissions of sulfur oxides, particulate matter and carbon dioxide.

“We are not abandoning the EU position or the green transition targets – but we need to find a way out of the stalemate,” the source said.","The Greek government is working on a proposal with the United States and Saudi Arabia to curb CO2 emissions from shipping, bypassing EU coordination on the issue.

The proposal is under discussion at the London-based International Maritime Organization (IMO). Athens is abandoning a joint EU position on global shipping decarbonisation, which is currently frozen at the IMO.

“Greece and Saudi Arabia have agreed to cooperate, through their competent ministries – shipping and energy – with a view to submitting a joint proposal on this specific matter,” Greek Energy Minister Stavros Papastavrou said on Thursday, following a meeting in Riyadh with his Saudi counterpart, Abdulaziz bin Salman Al Saud.

Athens is providing a “voice of realism” on energy issues in Europe, Papastavrou added.

The move is expected to raise eyebrows in Brussels. That’s because individual EU countries are expected to seek agreement with the remaining 26 rather than cooperate with third countries on a matter over which the European Commission holds exclusive competence.

It is already the second time Athens, home to much of the global shipping industry, has broken the bloc’s ranks after Greece, alongside Cyprus, abstained during an October vote in London on a global net-zero shipping deal.

At the centre of the debate is the Net-Zero Shipping Framework (NSF), which would force ship operators continuing to use the dirtiest – and cheapest – fuels to pay a gradually increasing carbon price, proportionate to their excess CO2 emissions.

In practice, the framework would prioritise low-carbon alternatives such as hydrogen and synthetic e-fuels derived from renewable energy, favouring countries such as Denmark and China, which have invested heavily in these technologies.

However, agreement on the proposal was postponed for a year last October following opposition from Washington and Riyadh. The US administration even threatened sanctions if the deal went ahead, as Washington supports liquefied natural gas (LNG) as a transitional fuel.

The diplomatic row last October was widely seen as another instance of Europe being caught in a broader geopolitical tug-of-war between Washington and Beijing. Denmark, which opposed the US line, appears to have paid a price, having failed for the first time in late November to secure re-election to the IMO Council.

Breaking the bloc

Following the chaotic October meeting, the European Commission told Euractiv that it was open to renegotiating the net-zero shipping deal. Now Greece appears to have renegotiated the deal with Washington and Riyadh, not Brussels.

But Greece’s position could trigger an infringement procedure within the EU.

One EU diplomat noted that only the EU as a whole can table a common position at the IMO, and that in the event of internal disagreement, the bloc simply has no official position.

“Member states do not align themselves with third-country camps,” the diplomat added.

Following the publication of the article, a Greek government source told Euractiv that Athens intends to work with all relevant stakeholders to reach an agreement that serves both the US and Europe.

About PowerCell Group PowerCell Group is a Swedish specialist in PEM fuel cell systems, spun out of Volvo back in 2009.","Ever caught yourself daydreaming about a giant bulk carrier powered by something shinier than heavy fuel oil? Welcome to the GAMMA project—where a 60,000 DWT bulk carrier will run everything from lights and pumps to navigation electronics on a 1 MW hydrogen fuel cell system, with the H2 made onboard from clean ammonia and biomethanol.

This isn’t Europe’s first rodeo with hydrogen fuel cells on ferries and coastal runs, but GAMMA is by far the first deep-sea retrofit at this scale.

A Decade of R&D Meets Maritime Ambition

Launched in early 2024, GAMMA is a five-year Horizon Europe programme, bankrolled with €13 million of EU cash in a €17 million budget. It wraps up years of R&D on hydrogen production, storage, and reformer design—while simultaneously polishing fuel cell technology—all driven by the IMO’s net-zero-by-2050 goals. Sixteen partners—from Germany’s Fraunhofer to Norway’s SINTEF and Italy’s Politecnico di Milano—are teaming up to pull off this ambitious demo, marking a big step forward for Europe’s industrial decarbonization ambitions.

Real-World Demo on Deep-Sea Vessels

Coordinated by Iceland’s engineering consultancy Verkis, the retrofit happens on a vessel managed by Italy’s ANT Topic. Instead of clattering diesel generators below deck, the ship will sport a proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell system cranking out 1 MW to keep hotel loads, pumps, and electronics humming during long ocean passages.

“This at-sea demo gives us the hard data we need to de-risk hydrogen fuel cells for the shipping world,” says Richard Berkling, CEO of PowerCell Group. Born as a Volvo spin-off in 2009, PowerCell has spent years refining its fuel cell technology in cars and power grids—and now it’s setting its sights on the high seas.

Onboard Hydrogen from Clean Ammonia

Let’s be real: stashing pure hydrogen on a ship is a logistical headache—think heavy tanks, extreme cooling, or insane pressures. GAMMA’s workaround? Carrying clean ammonia and biomethanol—liquids that behave at ambient temps—and reforming them onboard into H2. It’s classic petrochemical know-how meets renewable feedstocks. The result? A steady flow of hydrogen into those PEM stacks, with water vapor as the only exhaust.

“By blending ammonia and biomethanol reforming, we give ship operators real fuel flexibility,” explains Freyr Ingolfsson, project coordinator at Verkis. “Ports vary wildly in bunkering options, so our system adapts to whatever’s on offer.”

Key Metrics and Performance Goals

The consortium is chasing over 50% fuel cell efficiency and sub-15-minute start-up times. Engineers will track stack degradation, reformer conversion rates, and system resilience under rolling seas. Safety checks—like ammonia slip sensors and rapid shutdown routines—are under the microscope for class societies and insurers.

Marine Engineering Meets Fuel Cell Integration

Hooking a PEM fuel cell into a ship’s power grid is no small feat. You need power management that juggles variable loads, syncs to backup generators and batteries, and flips over seamlessly if something trips. Control logic—often coded by Politecnico di Milano—coordinates reformers, stacks, and HVAC, while safety interlocks lock everything down if ammonia levels spike or pressures climb.

Industrial Decarbonization in Action

Here’s the big picture: deep-sea shipping belts out roughly 2–3% of global CO₂ emissions, with auxiliary engines taking a hefty slice. Swapping fossil-fuel generators for zero-emission hydrogen fuel cells could cut hundreds of thousands of tons of carbon a year once scaled. GAMMA isn’t just a proof-of-concept; it’s charting a route for fresh regulations and port upgrades.

Consortium Collaboration and Governance

Verkis steers project management, keeping milestones aligned across all partners. Fraunhofer tackles systems safety analysis, SINTEF handles emissions monitoring, and Applus+ maps out the certification playbook. Europe-wide workshops keep everyone on the same page, and every deliverable goes through peer review—minimizing hiccups and sparking new ideas.

Business and Strategic Angle

Shipping is famously risk averse—fleets stick with what works. By showcasing a seamless retrofit, GAMMA lowers the bar for early adopters. For PowerCell Group, it’s a golden ticket to prove they can scale up from small demos. European makers of reformers, stacks, and control systems get a live proving ground to fine-tune products and drive down costs.

Europe’s racing to stand out in industrial decarbonization. A win here could unlock export markets for marine fuel cell technology—both on new builds and retrofits. Shipyards from Gothenburg to Genoa are already chatting with hydrogen and ammonia tech suppliers about green vessel contracts.

Supply Chain and Job Creation

The push toward maritime hydrogen will ripple across Europe’s industrial base. German component fabricators, Swedish reformer module makers, and Italian software integrators all stand to gain. GAMMA is already creating dozens of skilled roles in system assembly, commissioning, and remote diagnostics. Scale up to commercial fleets, and we’re talking hundreds more jobs along the value chain.

Challenges and Collateral Gains

Life at sea demands shock-resistant hardware, salt-tolerant materials, and space-efficient layouts. Upfront capital costs still loom large. But the benefits are compelling: real-world data on efficiency, maintenance intervals, and safety; a blueprint for classification societies; and confidence signals for investors and insurers. Local supply chains for hydrogen production and reforming modules get a boost, too, supporting more engineering and fabrication jobs.

Insurance firms and flag states will scrutinize the safety case, especially around clean ammonia. If GAMMA nails its risk mitigation, future projects could breeze through certification.

Regulatory Momentum and Standards

GAMMA’s technical dossier is primed to feed into the EU’s Fit for 55 debates and upcoming IMO guideline updates. As regulators push for transparent hydrogen infrastructure planning in emission control areas, demo projects become must-haves. Safe-handling protocols for clean ammonia will shape global standards, letting ports worldwide harmonize bunkering rules and certification pathways.

Implications for Maritime Infrastructure

Ports need to step up. Bunkering stations for clean ammonia, plus hydrogen hubs, could pop up along green shipping corridors. As ammonia producers, tank builders, and logistics experts collaborate, we may see a fresh hydrogen infrastructure network sprout in key hubs like Rotterdam and Singapore.

Next Steps and Sea Trials

Retrofitting is already underway, with factory tests lined up for next year, followed by dockside commissioning and live sea trials. The partners aim to deliver a full technical dossier—covering everything from hydrogen slip detection to life-cycle costs and emergency protocols. Those insights will feed into IMO discussions and emerging EU rules on zero-emission shipping.

Looking Ahead in the Blue Economy

GAMMA sits among a fleet of maritime decarbonization efforts—from wind-assisted sails to battery-hybrid ferries. Its success could tip the scales on which path the industry follows. For shipowners, charterers, and financiers, real-world proof beats simulations. Once the maiden voyages pay off, the blue economy could surge full speed toward a zero-emission future.

That is how Green Shipping Corridors move from policy commitment to operational delivery.”","Interferry has warned this week that ferry operators are facing rising costs under the EU Emissions Trading System faster than practical decarbonization solutions are being deployed.

The warning has renewed and intensified scrutiny of how maritime decarbonization commitments are being translated into action. This means emissions are being priced before the infrastructure needed to reduce them is in place, raising costs for operators without yet delivering equivalent emissions reductions.

Green Shipping Corridors, formally launched at COP26 through the Clydebank Declaration, were designed to provide that delivery pathway. More than four years on, the focus is increasingly shifting from policy frameworks to implementation, with short-sea Green Shipping Corridors widely recognized as the fastest and most viable way to move from commitment to delivery.

Against this backdrop, attention is turning to solutions that translate regulation and ambition into real emissions reductions, enabling ferry, short-sea cruise and RoRo operators to act in practice rather than absorb rising costs.

NatPower Marine says the concerns raised by the ferry industry further highlight a widening gap between regulation and the rollout of enabling infrastructure. Pricing emissions without rapidly giving operators the means to reduce them risks increasing costs, undermining route viability and pushing up ticket prices, without accelerating real-world decarbonization. In some cases, this may even weaken the role of ferries in shifting passengers and freight away from higher-emissions road transport.

Stefano D.M. Sommadossi, CEO of NatPower Marine UK, said the Interferry warning reflects a structural challenge facing maritime transport. “The ferry industry is signaling that obligations are rising faster than the infrastructure needed to meet them,” he said. “Climate policy only delivers results when operators can act on it in practice.”

While much of the regulatory debate continues to focus on long-term fuel pathways, NatPower Marine recognizes that short-sea ferry and RoPax routes present the most immediate opportunity to turn Green Shipping Corridors from commitments into operational reality. These services operate on fixed schedules, with frequent port calls and sufficient dwell time to fully benefit from port-side electrification.

Shore power and high-capacity e-ship charging enable vessels to eliminate emissions while at berth, delivering immediate reductions in carbon dioxide alongside significant cuts in nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides and particulate matter. In addition to improving compliance metrics such as the IMO’s Carbon Intensity Indicator, port-side power delivers tangible air-quality benefits for port cities and island communities that depend on ferry services.

Sommadossi said electrifying ports strengthens ferries as part of the climate solution rather than penalizing them. “If emissions pricing pushes freight and passengers away from ferries and back onto already congested road networks, overall emissions increase,” he said. “Port-side power does the opposite. It reinforces sea transport as the lowest-emissions corridor and supports long-standing objectives to shift traffic from road to sea.”

The company points to routes such as the 142 mile (123 nautical miles) Heysham–Belfast route as examples of how short-sea Green Shipping Corridors can move rapidly from policy ambition to delivery on the quayside. By installing shore power and e-ship charging infrastructure at the port, emissions can be cut immediately, giving operators the confidence to invest in electric and hybrid vessels.

The Heysham initiative represents a landmark step forward, with the potential to eliminate more than 10,000 tons of CO2 annually and sending a clear signal of commitment from all involved.

NatPower Marine’s route-based, fully funded infrastructure model removes the need for upfront capital investment by ferry operators, enabling decarbonization to scale without compromising connectivity, affordability, or competitiveness.

“The challenge facing maritime decarbonization is not a lack of ambition,” Sommadossi concluded. “Since the Clydebank Declaration, regulation has accelerated, from FuelEU Maritime to the EU ETS, while a global IMO framework remains uncertain. What has not kept pace is the rollout of enabling infrastructure. Short-sea corridors show that when port-side power is in place, emissions fall immediately and commercially. That is how Green Shipping Corridors move from policy commitment to operational delivery.”",https://www.ajot.com/images/uploads/article/_large/Stefano-Sommadossi-CEO-NatPower_1.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 14:57:42.953029

MSC sees hydrogen and biofuels as the future fuel mix for shipping, and it can provide a practical roadmap for procurement teams to align them with long-term decarbonization goals. The approach lets teams polegać on interoperable technologie, with early testing on key lanes delivering actionable data to guide scale-up.

Concrete data from trials show emissions reductions depend on the fuel and the supply chain. Green hydrogen produced from renewables can cut lifecycle emissions by up to 90% versus heavy fuel oil on selected routes, while biofuels such as ISCC-certified fats and oils or hydrotreated vegetable oil typically deliver 60-80% reductions, depending on feedstock and processing. To manage risk, start with a phased procurement plan and measure energy intensity as you scale.

Engaging cross-industry partners–ports, engine makers, fuel suppliers, insurers, and financiers–contributes to faster technology maturation. A conference this year will provide a platform to share data, which joins practical field insights there with policy signals to help operators plan investments and timelines.

To translate insights into action, build a procurement strategy that prioritizes long-term fuel guarantees, invest in bunkering infrastructure, and run pilot projects on flagship routes. Align with engine makers to ensure technologie are retrofitted and crews trained; monitor performance, fuel compatibility, and safety margins; keep track of costs and availability so supply chains remain reliable. This work will require cross-silo collaboration and clear governance.

There remains a path forward: as technologie become perfected, costs fall and supply chains mature. The entire industry benefits when pozyskiwanie levers are aligned with route planning, port calls, and vessel design; with ongoing engaging forums and cross-industry collaboration, ship operators can move toward a decarbonized future.

MSC Sees Hydrogen and Biofuels in Shipping’s Future Fuel Mix and Hydrogen Council Collaboration

Recommend launching a three-year mediterranean pilot program to test hydrogen and biofuel blends on scheduled routes, targeting a 20% hydrogen-in-fuel injection by 2030 and 50% by 2035, with six corridors and a marketplace-ready plan to demonstrate a revenue-neutral model that scales with demand.

Hydrogen Council collaboration should establish a unified fuel standard, actively facilitate cross-border sharing of fuel data, and create a joint marketplace for supply and logistics that reduces downtime and cost disruption for fleets.

MSC sees hydrogen and biofuels as the future fuel mix and positions them as an alternative to traditional bunker fuels. Related pilots show blended solutions can cut sulfur emissions and improve carbon intensity across mediterranean ports while maintaining reliability for the fleet.

To overcome infrastructure gaps, the plan coordinates public-private funding to provide anchor investments in ports, storage, bunkering, and injection points, while building supply chain visibility that can scale with demand.

Active collaboration across industry stakeholders will capture massive volume growth as more terminals and shipyards join. There is growing investor appetite for early-stage deployment, and the source of hydrogen from renewable electricity and biofuel supply chains is critical. The approach must be engaging for customers and port authorities alike, with transparent reporting and sharing of results.

Given the scale, MSC must facilitate ongoing data sharing, track performance, and report progress quarterly; the partnership contributes to a diversified energy mix and a resilient marketplace that accepts blended fuels across the mediterranean fleet.

Which biofuels are MSC piloting on core routes?

Pilot HVO blends on mediterranean core routes now and scale renewable methanol on select corridors within 12–18 months.

Which biofuels are MSC piloting on core routes? The current program centers on three fuels with proven compatibility and scalable supply chains:

Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO) blended with MGO up to 30–50% on a portion of the fleet serving mediterranean and adjacent EU corridors, preserving engine performance while cutting lifecycle emissions.

FAME biodiesel blends (20–40%) on high-density container lanes and feeder services, with careful monitoring of storage, cold flow, and bunker compatibility.

Renewable methanol (bio-methanol) as an alternative on selected short-haul core routes, enabling a near-term decarbonisation pathway and aligning with portside bunkering density.

To accelerate deployment, MSC forms partnerships with fuel suppliers, ports, and companies, embedding a darr framework to track data and performance. The maritime network in the mediterranean is expanding, strengthening marketplace options and giving the fleet confidence to scale. This development approach prioritises blended fuels first and includes a perfected handling process to ensure seamless container ship operations and smooth bunkering. Further steps include extending pilots to additional core routes and refining supply chains. These steps help decarbonise maritime operations.

What hydrogen readiness steps are needed for MSC ships?

Begin with a term-based hydrogen readiness plan that decarbonise a subset of MSC shippings and push the broader fleet toward a measurable decarbonisation path, anchored by groups across member companies and external partners to guarantee a neutral, data-driven assessment of which technologies perform best.

Map routes and demand to determine the hydrogen source and the scale of on-board storage and injection needs. Evaluate options including high-pressure tanks, cryogenic LH2, and carrier-based approaches, and plan how injection will feed main engines or auxiliary power with clear safety interlocks and fuel-handling workflows, to capture learning for the next wave of upgrades.

Choose propulsion concepts MSC can retrofit: dual-fuel engines or hydrogen-only modules; outline the technical work, required certifications, and how systems will integrate with propulsion, power, and hull design.

Develop safety and compliance frameworks: standardised design rules, crew training, leak detection, bunkering procedures, and emergency response plans aligned with port authorities and flag states.

Build a massive bunkering and storage network in key ports to support a steady supply, plus on-shore generation or reliable hydrogen source injection; design a term-based sourcing approach with suppliers and ensure a neutral, traceable supply chain.

Set up governance across the groups: a cross-functional steering body, clear milestones, and a data-sharing term that measures fuel efficiency, emissions reductions, and operational risk, with feedback loops to scale the programme across the member fleet.

Which port and bunkering upgrades are planned to support hydrogen?

Implement a phased bunkering blueprint that pairs fixed hydrogen hubs with mobile units, using standardized 350/700 bar interfaces and dual-hose transfer. Equip berths with on-site electrolysis capacity of 10–20 MW where wind or solar is available, and store hydrogen in cryogenic tanks sized at 2 × 20,000 kg per berth. Ensure injection lines and shore connections meet ISO 19880-1 standards and include robust safety systems, leak detection, and pressure management. This configuration mainly targets reliable supply for large vessels while enabling rapid fueling, helping to overcome gaps during peak port calls. MSC says the approach centers on decarbonization and invites collaboration across groups including shippings, energy providers, and port authorities. The plan also contemplates both green hydrogen production and blue options that may rely on capture when CCS is deployed.

Given the need for scale, ports should align with conference-led industry work and standardization bodies to harmonize interfaces. Build partnerships with energy suppliers, equipment manufacturers, and shipping lines to share risk and investment, and establish a neutral governance model that prioritizes safety and interoperability. Define the source of hydrogen to ensure transparency, and prepare for injections and meters that support different hydrogen sources, including green electrolysis and blue hydrogen from low-emission reforming. Prioritize a phased rollout: start with a few berths per port, then expand as demand grows and maintenance schedules allow, while exploring alternative fuels integration where feasible.

Port Planned Upgrades Capacity/Timeline Partners/Notes Port of Rotterdam (Netherlands) Two fixed H2 bunkering berths at Maasvlakte; 350/700 bar delivery; on-site 10–20 MW electrolyzer; cryogenic storage for 2 × 20,000 kg; shore-to-ship injection lines; safety and monitoring 2025–2027 (phase 1), full rollout by 2028 Port Authority, major energy players, shipping lines; CCS pilot for blue H2 Singapur STS bunkering readiness; fixed 350 bar stations; on-site 5–10 MW electrolyzer; storage ~2 × 10,000 kg; pipeline tie-in to LNG hub; injection lines 2026–2028 MPA, local utilities, energy firms; emphasis on interoperable interfaces Los Angeles/Long Beach (USA) On-site green hydrogen production (5–15 MW); fixed berths; 350/700 bar; storage 2 × 15,000 kg; mobile bunkering support; injections and safety 2027–2029 Port Authorities, regional energy partners, shipping groups Busan (South Korea) Hydrogen bunkering readiness; fixed stations; 350/700 bar; on-site electrolyzer 5–10 MW; storage 2 × 8,000–12,000 kg; integration with national hydrogen grid 2026–2028 Busan Port Authority, energy companies, local shipowners

These upgrades create a practical, scalable hydrogen supply chain at key hubs, supporting collaborations across development work and cross-border partnerships. The focus remains on clean source diversification, safe injection practices, and continuous improvement as shippings adopt hydrogen as a core element of the decarbonization agenda.

What milestones does the Hydrogen Council collaboration target and when?

Target deployments by 2025 and scale to mainstream use by 2030–2035, with concrete steps to decarbonize the entire shipping sector. The plan focuses on biofuels and hydrogen as alternative fuels, designed to raise efficiency and reduce emissions. Yesterday’s pilots validated the approach and provided information that fuels further development, which informs timelines for scale and sharing across companies.

2025 – Pilot deployments across three cross-border corridors to test hydrogen and biofuels blends aboard merchant ships. Target cumulative volume of 0.2 million tonnes of low-carbon fuels; aim for 10–15% efficiency gains on pilot routes; actively share findings to accelerate learning and establish related safety and operation standards among participating companies.

2027 – Scale-up framework established: standardized bunkering procedures, procurement processes, and safety rules; port readiness in 10 hubs; retrofit or conversion of 15 vessels; aim to reduce lifecycle emissions on the test routes by 20–25%; information sharing broadened to industry groups to support rapid implementation.

2030 – Commercial viability demonstrated on 5–7 major sea routes; fuel mix includes hydrogen and biofuels on a growing share of vessels, with 5–8% of newbuilds adopting low-carbon propulsion; production capacity for low-carbon fuels reaches about 2 million tonnes per year; price parity targets advanced to enable broader scale adoption.

2035 – Mainstream adoption across mid-sized and large fleets: 20–25% of newbuilds powered by hydrogen or biofuels; bunkering networks expand to 30+ hubs; overall volume of low-carbon fuels in shipping increases substantially, supporting a measurable decarbonization of main trade lanes while maintaining efficiency improvements in operations.

2040 – Extended scale and sustained development: 40–60% of new ships use low-carbon fuels; decarbonization of the entire sector accelerates, driven by continued collaboration and sharing of information; biofuels and hydrogen supply chains mature to support ongoing growth, with related sectors such as ports and logistics benefiting from the pioneering approach.

How will transition costs, incentives, and financing be managed?

Establish a pioneering, multi-stakeholder council that leads blended financing and procurement for fuel switch, with term sheets and volume forecasts to reduce upfront costs for container groups and fleets.

Agree on a shared risk framework where upfront capex for engines, storage, and bunkering infra is financed via SPVs and green bonds, with long-term offtake commitments from groups of companies. By spreading risk across a portfolio, a company can reduce the annualized cost of transition and accelerate the massive uptake of hydrogen and blended fuels. This framework contributes to predictable budgeting for sponsors and shipowners.

Link incentives to emissions outcomes and volume milestones, using subsidies, tax credits, and concessional lending from public programs. A push from ports and governments to create dedicated blending hubs reduces supply risk, while a council can authorize sharing of ramp-up costs across routes, ensuring there’s enough capacity to meet demand. The council will produce monthly reports to track progress and reinforce accountability.

Theres a need to set up reserve funds to handle price swings and port readiness delays, minimizing disruption to the fleet.

Launch a mass procurement program for fuels across suppliers to capture volume discounts, with a rolling tender for blended fuels and hydrogen-ready solutions. A container-fleet-wide procurement hub reduces price volatility, and the specs that suppliers must meet across ports along major corridors ensure reliability.

The financing framework uses a term of 7-12 years for engine retrofits and bunkering upgrades, with performance-based payments tied to fleet emissions reductions and fuel savings. Engaging shipping lines in a consortium creates a clear push for scalable solutions, ensuring there’s capacity as volumes rise along key corridors. Early pilots in three ports produce data on cost per ton-km and capture benefits from hydrogen blends and biofuels.",https://blog.gettransport.com/wp-content/themes/main/img/favicon/favicon.ico,N,,2026-01-22 08:37:00.655189

With the IMO NZF’s future unclear, its carbon levy delayed and global politics more fractious than ever, MEPC’s October 2025 extraordinary session, and its one-year adjournment, now form the starting point for any assessment of IMO’s environmental agenda in 2026.

Where does the NZF currently stand?

On a technical level, the basic architecture of the framework survived attacks from US President Trump and others in 2025.

The approved draft package that makes up NZF combines a greenhouse gas fuel-intensity trajectory with a market-based measure and is backed by states that had argued for a flat-rate carbon levy to be contained within MARPOL Annexes.

IMO described the framework as a new set of regulations built around a tighter fuel-intensity standard and a linked pricing scheme for non-compliance and reward scheme for compliance.

The October session did not dismantle this structure; it only deferred the political decision on adoption.

Before delegates met in London, the working assumption was that October 2025 would deliver the adoption of revised MARPOL Annex VI text and agreement on the market-based measure, with measures entering into force 16 months later under the tacit acceptance procedure. That timetable would have placed the first compliance period around 2027.

With a vote delayed, politics will continue to shape discussions on the NZF in 2026: US Secretaries Marco Rubio, Chris Wright and Sean Duffy warned that countries backing the framework could face port fees, sanctions, investigations and visa restrictions.

A letter published by the US administration described the proposal as “the first global carbon tax” and a “European-led neocolonial export of global climate regulations”.

Mr Trump then posted on X that he was “outraged that the International Maritime Organization is voting in London this week to pass a global carbon tax” and said the United States would not adhere to “this global green new scam tax on shipping”.

In session at the extraordinary meeting of MEPC in October 2025, US interventions and those from other petro-states helped shift support towards a procedural motion that delayed the vote for one year.

Against this background, guideline work continues but the scope for manoeuvre is constrained.

IMO’s intersessional working groups, including ISWG-GHG 20 in September 2025, have agreed to continue developing guidelines and recommended that MEPC consider options for resuming the extraordinary session in October 2026.

Among other tasks, MEPC in 2026 is expected to take up terms of reference for the Fifth IMO GHG Study.

What happens next?

Three broad pathways emerge: if the resumed extraordinary session in October 2026 adopts the framework with only limited changes, IMO procedural rules and norms would point to entry into force for the legislation around March 2028.

If disagreements over pricing, revenue use and transitional pathways force extensive revisions, 2026 may be dominated by further drafting.

If political resistance hardens, agreement could slip again and regional measures multiply.

For shipowners, charterers and financiers, 2026 will therefore be less a new beginning than a complex negotiation inevitably shaped by choices already made, and Mr Trump has made clear his preferred outcome.",https://dvzpv6x5302g1.cloudfront.net/AcuCustom/Sitename/DAM/177/Presideent_Trump_2_White_Housewebzhgfssswww_Main.png,N,,2026-01-21 06:57:16.985688

A meeting of the International Maritime Organization's (IMO) Sub-Committee on Ship Design and Construction (SDC 12) opened today, as reported by the Clean Arctic Alliance. The Alliance, a coalition of 24 not-for-profit organizations, is calling on IMO member states to ensure the organization continues to push for progress in reducing underwater noise from shipping, especially in Arctic waters where noise levels are anticipated to nearly quadruple by 2030.

""SDC 12 provides an opportunity for member states to ensure that shippers are getting clear technical guidance on the work they need to do in order to advance IMO policies that will assure the reduction of shipping noise"", said Sarah Bobbe, Senior Manager, Arctic Program at Ocean Conservancy. ""So far, this work remains insufficient relative to the growing threats faced by regions experiencing increased shipping traffic, such as the Arctic, underscoring the need for parallel policy advancement through the IMO's Marine Environmental Protection Committee in the coming months.""

Bobbe noted that much of the Arctic has been free of human-sourced sound for a long time, but with increased activity, its waters are becoming noisier every year. Shipping, specifically from propellers and engines, is an important source of this noise.

A key paper submitted to SDC 12 by WWF provides new maps showing, for the first time, the migratory corridors of Arctic whales across the Arctic Ocean. The maps are intended to help mariners know where to take measures during migratory months in spring and autumn. Operational measures like rerouting and speed restrictions can reduce impacts on whales, alongside technical measures to quieten ships.

""By putting migratory corridors on the map for these three whale species that we know to be especially sensitive to underwater noise, we hope to support the shipping community to take necessary measures to safeguard them"", said Melanie Lancaster of WWF's Global Arctic Programme. ""It will take international cooperation among states, ship operators, shipping companies and IMO to ensure their safe and quiet passage.""

The WWF paper outlines how IMO Member States should consider adopting shipping measures in the Arctic, similar to measures adopted elsewhere to safeguard whales. It provides information for similar preventative measures to be adopted in the Arctic.

Andrew Dumbrille, Co-Founder and Director of Equal Routes, linked the situation in the Arctic to concerns about proposed LNG terminals in the Gulf of California. ""Our recommendations to SDC 12 for the Gulf of California are equally important for the Arctic as both regions could see devastating impacts from future increased shipping, especially from LNG tankers, for marine wildlife particularly sensitive to noise, like marine mammals"", Dumbrille said.

Those recommendations include acknowledging irreversible noise impacts from LNG tankers, promoting ship design that considers noise damage, and opposing LNG traffic in critical ecological areas due to underwater noise pollution.",https://www.indexbox.io/landing/img/Default.webp,N,,2026-01-21 06:57:11.867959

… said Mike Corrigan, CEO of Interferry.

Ferry services are critically important to Europe, with more than half of the world’s gross RoRo- and passenger ship tonnage operating in European waters, transporting 400 million passengers and 200 million vehicles and freight units every year within the EU, significantly offloading the road network. According to Interferry, every euro of freight rate increase on ferries risks pushing freight volumes back to the already congested European road networks.

Interferry made clear that supports the decarbonization of maritime transport and accepted the EU ETS on the understanding that the funds collected would be reinvested in reducing emissions and that road transport would also be included. However, the EU Council recently postponed the inclusion of road transport, raising concerns that ferry end users, such as island communities, are bearing the full cost of the ETS.

As explained, this situation creates a competitive disadvantage for short-sea shipping, as higher ferry costs may push goods and passengers back onto congested road networks, contrary to the EU’s long-standing goal of shifting transport from road to sea.

As it stands now, ETS creates an adverse incentive, pushing goods and passengers back onto already congested road networks due to higher ferry costs. This directly contradicts the long-standing EU policy of modal shift from road to sea

… commented Johan Roos, Director Regulatory Affairs of Interferry.

The challenge is compounded by the International Maritime Organization’s decision in October 2025 to postpone the adoption of a global greenhouse gas pricing mechanism for at least 12 months. This mechanism was intended to replace the EU ETS and provide clear guidelines for reinvesting revenues in decarbonization. In the meantime, EU ferry operators are taxed for CO2 emissions without clarity on how the funds will support emissions reduction or certainty on when a global regulation will take effect.

The role of clean fuels in energy’s future

Liquid and gaseous fuels are vital to the global economy, supplying 56% of global final energy use today1 (~250 exajoules, EJ)2,3 and attracting ~$1 trillion of investment each year. Global energy demand is expected to continue to rise, driven by growth in both economies and populations.

While electrification is central to most energy scenarios, some transport and industrial energy demands cannot be substituted effectively with electricity. Additionally, clean fuels can help reduce emissions near-term, by using existing assets and established value chains that currently rely on unabated fossil fuels.

Across most scenarios, liquid and gaseous fuels will remain a significant share of the world’s energy supply for decades, with 2050 estimates ranging from 175-285 EJ (40-55% of total supply), equal to roughly four to five times current US demand Clean fuels span multiple production pathways, representing different combinations of feedstocks, conversion technologies and end-product fuels.

These fuels are a critical tool to reduce emissions in fuel-reliant sectors such as transport and industry, where energy density, storability, chemical properties and infrastructure compatibility make molecules the most competitive or only option.

Molecules are particularly relevant for applications such as aviation, shipping, parts of road transport and certain industrial processes that require high heat or molecules as chemical feedstocks. Clean fuels also enable refineries to adapt to the shifting demand mix and sustain asset utilization by making use of existing energy infrastructure.

Scaling-up the market in the next decade calls for a dual focus. First, existing commercial pathways need expanding; second, greater innovation is required in early-stage pathways. Ramping up commercial fuels such as biogas, bioethanol and biodiesel – alongside measures that lower emissions from existing fossil fuels – can contribute to near-term emissions reductions, with the right incentives and safeguards.

…the report explains.

These fuels can be deployed with lower capital investment into established value chains as blend-in or drop-in solutions, serving as stepping stones to the future fuel mix.

However, rapid commercialization of new feedstocks and technologies is needed to ease supply constraints, reduce fuel emissions intensity and meet demand targets within the next 5-10 years. Despite the higher cost of clean fuels, blending strategies (virtual or physical) can limit the impacts on consumer pricing as markets mature and costs come down, while pursuing a portfolio of pathways.

Joint action to deploy proven solutions has untapped potential to accelerate the market.

Three insights emerge from success stories:

– Performance-based policies rewarding verified emissions reductions and other benefits have successfully embedded societal value in investment decisions. For example, in Brazil, tradeable credits, along with low-interest loans and tax incentives, have stimulated demand in support of energy security and industrial development. The success of such policies depends on interoperable standards and predictable market instruments to create revenue certainty where there is a credible path to competitiveness.

– Public-private mechanisms, such as double sided auctions or book-and-claim, pool risks and connect producers and customers where markets are sub-scale.

– Businesses partnering across the value chain can signal demand and potential supply, while rethinking how to contract, finance and allocate capital. This approach is proving successful in unlocking projects by bridging the gap between the market risks and infrastructure-type investment that characterizes clean fuel projects.

Over the last few years, the question among business leaders in the industry has evolved from should we invest, to how and when. We find that those who succeed generating value are rethinking how to approach projects focusing on customers, embracing flexibility and partnerships, and mitigating investment risk.

Greece and Cyprus both abstained and were the only EU members who did not back the NZF.

Papastavrou's comments will presumably do little to reassure those who believe the NZF can be revived later this year, with Greece's stance naturally carrying significant weight in global shipping policy.",https://shipandbunker.cdn.speedyrails.net/a/img/_mt_e0540bb3310c654764bd3b139e30a5c2.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 05:57:25.041151

Two of these projects were awarded under the dedicated maritime topic, receiving more than €35 million to supply renewable hydrogen to maritime off-takers.

The auction operates under the domestic pillar of the European Hydrogen Bank, which aims to scale up European hydrogen production and strengthen market integration. It supports the replacement of natural gas, coal and oil in hard-to-decarbonise industries and transport sectors. The awarded funding will help these projects bridge the difference between their production costs and the price that industrial users are willing to pay for their product. This market-based design also aims to reduce risks for investors and lessen the administrative burden for applicants.

The hydrogen produced is renewable fuel of non-biological origin (RFNBO) and is expected to be used in key sectors like the chemical industry and mobility, mostly in helping decarbonise maritime and heavy-duty transport. Together, these projects are projected to produce around 500 kilotonnes of renewable hydrogen, cutting almost 3.4 million tonnes of CO₂ emissions over an operational period of 10 years.

The projects are located in Spain, Finland and Norway, and will install a total of 381.25 megawatts of electrolyser capacity. The individual grant values range from €135.5 million to €1.8 million for installations with a megawatt electric (MWe) capacity from 5 to 200 MWe. The awarded projects presented bids going from €0.33 to €1.88 per kilogram of RFNBO Hydrogen.

** Calculated based on the 2021-2025 ETS benchmark of 6.84 tons CO2e/tH2, not taking into account additional carbon abatement due to substitution effects in the H2 end use application (i.e conservative estimate)

Auctions as a Service

In parallel, Spain, Lithuania, and Austria allocated €836 million in national funding for projects in their countries through the Innovation Fund’s ‘Auctions-as-a-service' feature. This allows Member States to identify and fund eligible projects in their territories that meet the qualification criteria but cannot be funded by the Innovation Fund due to budgetary limitations.

‘Auctions-as-a-Service' is open to all Member States, enabling them to benefit from the EU-level auction platform and award national funding to additional projects with a simplified procedure. Projects awarded by participating Member States will be announced by the respective national authorities.

Next Steps

The European Climate, Infrastructure and Environment Executive Agency (CINEA) will accompany the projects throughout the development phase, ensuring compliance with Innovation Fund requirements and supporting smooth progress toward financial close and construction.

The IF24 Auction will provide a fixed premium per kilogram of certified and verified renewable hydrogen (RFNBO) produced. Signed projects must reach financial close within two and a half years and start producing renewable hydrogen within five years. They will receive the fixed premium for up to ten years, based on certified and verified RFNBO hydrogen production.

The Hydrogen Bank is already working on the next cycle: the third Innovation Fund Hydrogen Auction was launched on 4 December 2025 with a budget of up to €1.3 billion. The deadline to submit proposals is 19 February, 17:00 CET via the EU Funding & Tenders Portal.

Background

The Innovation Fund is one of the world’s largest funding programmes for the deployment of innovative net-zero technologies, with an estimated budget of €40 billion from the revenues of auctioning allowances under the EU Emissions Trading System between 2020 and 2030.

The European Hydrogen Bank is an initiative to facilitate the EU's domestic production and imports of renewable hydrogen. It aims to unlock private investment in the EU and in third countries by addressing investment challenges, closing the funding gap, and connecting a future renewable hydrogen supply to consumers.

Under the first renewable hydrogen auction (IF23 Auction), six projects signed their grant agreements in 2024 and five of them have now entered the implementation phase, producing renewable hydrogen used in sectors such as steel, chemicals, maritime transport and fertilisers.

H2SITE Ammonia Cracking Solution

H2SITE is a Spanish scale-up company headquartered in Bilbao, where the core of its technology is designed and manufactured. From its industrial facility in Loiu (Bizkaia), H2SITE produces thousands of palladium-alloy membranes each year, which are integrated into membrane reactor systems enabling efficient conversion of hydrogen carriers back into hydrogen. In the case of ammonia, H2SITE has developed cracking systems capable of delivering high-purity hydrogen that can be supplied directly to fuel cells or blend in engines. This capability is particularly relevant for maritime and offshore applications, where operational reliability, system integration and fuel logistics are critical.

Norway represents a highly relevant environment for this technology. The country combines a strong maritime heritage with clear climate ambitions and a pragmatic, goal-oriented approach to innovation and first-of-a-kind projects. Norway is already assessing the use of ammonia onboard vessels in commercial operations. With a local presence, H2SITE aims to work directly with Norwegian shipowners, shipyards and technology partners to adapt its systems to real vessel profiles and operating conditions.

The decision to invest now is driven by risk management. H2SITE believes that the commercial and regulatory risks of delaying decarbonisation now outweigh the risks associated with adopting new technologies. Ammonia, when used as an energy carrier and combined with efficient conversion systems, offers a credible route towards zero-emissions vessels and long-term compliance rather than short-term mitigation.

H2SITE Norway AS has been established at a stage where the technology is already validated, and the focus has moved to product implementation. Since 2023, H2SITE has built and operated ammonia crackers for more than 6,000 hours, including extended continuous operation in relevant environments. Maritime-focused projects such as H2Ocean and APOLO have addressed integration with fuel cells and engines. In parallel, H2SITE is building MW-scale systems and has reached the manufacturing capacity required to support early commercial projects.

Achieving zero-emissions vessels across multiple segments remains challenging. Vessel types such as RoRo, bulk carriers, platform supply vessels and tankers face technical and operational barriers. While ammonia-to-power 4-stroke engines are approaching commercial readiness, challenges remain at low loads, including ammonia slip and the need for pilot fuel. Onboard cracking allows shipowners to benefit from liquid ammonia storage and established logistics while producing hydrogen that enhances combustion and enables the use of fuel cells for high-efficiency auxiliary power. Hybrid solutions, as well as full fuel-cell propulsion, provide practical pathways towards ammonia-fuelled zero-emissions vessels. Regulatory developments reinforce this direction. While global frameworks such as IMO regulations continue to evolve, FuelEU Maritime and the EU Emissions Trading System are already shaping investment decisions and will progressively tighten over time.

H2SITE Norway is positioned as a platform for collaboration. The next step is pilot and demonstration projects that allow systems to be integrated and operated under realistic conditions. “The technology is proven; the priority now is implementation of the product and operational learning,” said Tomás Crespo, Maritime Business Development Manager at H2SITE Norway. “We are looking to work with Norwegian shipowners and shipyards that want to take a measured, forward-looking approach to decarbonisation.”

Looking ahead, the coming year will be about projects and execution deploying systems in real operating environments, gathering operational data and refining solutions in close cooperation with the Norwegian maritime industry. This strategic initiative highlights H2SITE’s dedication to addressing one of the key challenges in maritime decarbonisation: enabling efficient and economically viable onboard hydrogen production. By making hydrogen available at sea for both propulsion and auxiliary power systems, we are actively supporting the transition toward a cleaner and more competitive future for the shipping industry.

The agreement sets legally binding rules for the sustainable use of ocean resources on the high seas. It applies beyond national jurisdictions.

The treaty covers marine genetic resources and benefit sharing. It introduces area-based management tools, including marine protected areas. It strengthens environmental impact assessments. It also supports capacity building and technology transfer.

IMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez welcomed the milestone. He said countries had shown they can work together to manage the ocean sustainably. He added that IMO is ready to support implementation within its remit.

Shipping already operates under strict global rules. Environmental, safety, and security standards apply throughout a vessel’s voyage.

IMO has developed more than 50 binding treaties to support sustainable shipping. Flag, coastal, and port State control enforce these rules.

Key IMO instruments include MARPOL, the Ballast Water Management Convention, and the London Convention and Protocol. These measures help prevent pollution and the spread of invasive species.

IMO is also developing a new binding framework on ship biofouling. The goal is to further reduce the transfer of invasive aquatic species.

The organization has adopted additional protections. These include Particularly Sensitive Sea Areas, Special Areas, and Emission Control Areas. IMO has also issued guidance to reduce underwater ship noise.

More than 90 percent of global trade moves by sea, with shipping alone accounting for nearly 3 percent of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. With the International Maritime Organization (IMO) setting a net-zero target for the shipping sector, maritime nations are reassessing how economic growth and sustainability can be pursued in tandem. For developing economies like India, which rely heavily on maritime trade, port networks, and coastal livelihoods, this transition is challenging.

Harit Sagar outlines the pathway for India’s major ports to enhance energy efficiency and climate resilience aligned to international standards.

Indian ports handle almost 95 percent of trade by volume and 70 percent by value, making them critical actors in climate action. India launched the Harit Sagar Green Port Guidelines in 2023 to make its blue economy sustainable, aligning port development with its Nationally Determined Contribution and the Panchamrit goals, which outline five climate commitments. As part of Maritime Amrit Kaal Vision 2047 and Maritime India Vision 2030, Harit Sagar outlines the pathway for India’s major ports to enhance energy efficiency and climate resilience aligned to international standards. It aims to integrate climate ambition with development and trade, offering a template for other developing economies.

Global Net-Zero Shipping and Emerging Economy Limits

IMO’s revised GHG Strategy (2023) sets milestones for cutting emissions from international shipping “by or around 2050,” signalling a net-zero transition by mid-century. It calls for at least a 20-percent reduction, aiming for 30 percent, by 2030, and at least a 70-percent reduction, aiming for 80 percent, by 2040, compared to 2008 levels. In response, Singapore’s Maritime and Port Authority is targeting a 60-percent reduction in its total port emissions by 2030, while introducing ammonia bunkering to scale alternative fuel use. Additionally, the Rotterdam-Singapore Green and Digital Shipping Corridor ensures that international partnerships cut emissions on the major trade route by 20-30 percent by 2030.

Emerging economies and Small Island Developing States (SIDS) face significant constraints, including limited access to finance, structural issues, technological challenges, capacity gaps, and infrastructure readiness,

Unlike Singapore, however, emerging economies and Small Island Developing States (SIDS) face significant constraints, including limited access to finance, structural issues, technological challenges, capacity gaps, and infrastructure readiness, which limit their ability to meet the IMO’s targets. In such countries, smaller ports are often overlooked in the pursuit of larger maritime objectives, while their older fleets risk becoming obsolete. Moreover, new rules on fuels and efficiency could impact the already strained trade routes. Despite their potential to adopt alternative fuels more rapidly than developed economies, the evolving regulatory ecosystem for safety and bunkering could inhibit their progress. Additionally, most green hydrogen and methanol projects, still at the pilot stage, may take longer to scale up.

India, with its national ambitions, its role on the IMO Council, and its focus on strengthening maritime presence, has an opportunity to offer solutions rooted in local realities through its green port framework. However, to achieve this, India’s Harit Sagar efforts will have to move beyond being mere guidelinesby ensuring investments in sustainable port practices, supporting coastal communities, and encouraging green innovation. Such a transformation will require accounting for local trade, population, and environmental needs, as well as overcoming the coordination challengesamong ministries, port authorities, state governments, and private operators, which can delay on-the-ground action.

Harit Sagar’s whole-of-port approach accounts for all activities that contribute to a port’s carbon footprint, including cargo handling and storage, ship operations, logistics services, and hinterland connectivity.

India’s Framework for Climate-Resilient Port Growth

Harit Sagar’s whole-of-port approach accounts for all activities that contribute to a port’s carbon footprint, including cargo handling and storage, ship operations, logistics services, and hinterland connectivity. The framework follows an ‘Eliminate, Reduce, and Control’ model, guiding ports in their everyday decisions towards carbon-neutral development without adversely impacting nearby marine ecosystems and coastal communities.

● Clean Energy Transition and Circular Economy

Harit Sagar encourages ports to adopt cleaner operations through solar and wind energy, equipment and vehicle retrofitting, electrification, and shore power for berthed ships. Ports must reduce carbon emissions by 30 percent per tonne of cargo by 2030 and 70 percent by 2047, while increasing renewable energy use. They are also expected to phase in shore-to-ship power, reuse all wastewater, and reduce freshwater use by over 20 percent by 2030. New Mangalore Port, which now operates entirely on solar power, is a strong example of these initiatives. The framework also focuses on efficient resource use by encouraging ports to streamline operations, reduce ‘idle’ time, and adopt energy-efficient technologies to lower carbon intensity. Additionally, the framework supports circular economy practices, such as efficient waste management, the reuse of dredged material, and waste-to-wealth initiatives, to help ports move towards zero waste while creating economic value.

● Scaling Renewable Energy Across Indian Ports

Harit Sagar prepares ports for future fuels, including green hydrogen, green ammonia, and green methanol, aligned with India’s National Green Hydrogen Mission. Ports are expected to increase renewable energy use to over 60 percent by 2030 and 90 percent by 2047. They must also upgrade infrastructure with specific targets to support offshore wind energy, LNG bunkering and EV charging, while promoting coastal shipping. For instance, Deendayal Port is planning 20 MW of solar and wind capacity; Visakhapatnam has 10 MW of solar; V.O.Chidambaranar Port (VOC) and New Mangalore are expanding their renewable installations. VOC has launched India’s first green hydrogen pilot for streetlights and EV charging, and is planning a green methanol bunkering facility. Ports are also implementing LED lighting upgrades, green building, electrified rail links, and plans for shore power to improve resource efficiency.

● Managing Water, Pollution, and Biodiversity at Ports

The framework considers ports as integral to the coastline and the nearby communities. It focuses on conserving shoreline and mangroves, mitigating air and noise pollution, using water efficiently, managing waste, bilge, and ballast water responsibly, and minimising the impact of dredging. It also considers recharging groundwater as a carbon sink, desalination, and rainwater harvesting. They set clear targets, including reducing freshwater use per tonne of cargo by over 20 percent by 2030, recycling or reusing all wastewater, and increasing green cover by more than 20 percent to strengthen biodiversity and coastal protection.

● Building Climate-Resilient Port Infrastructure

Harit Sagar emphasises the need for ports to prepare for climate risks by regularly assessing local vulnerabilities, strengthening infrastructure, and planning for challenges such as sea-level rise, cyclones, flooding, and coastal erosion. This approach acknowledges that ports must continue to function safely and reliably even as climate impacts increase, while aligning with international objectives. Mormugao Port in Goa, for instance, has been recognised as India’s first green port under Harit Shrey—a green incentive scheme for vessels. The port is listed on the global Environmental Ship Index as a model for promoting cleaner shipping and more sustainable practices across India’s port operations.

● Governance and Transparency in Green Port Systems

The parameters emphasise regular monitoring and reporting of port operations to prevent greenwashing and ensure compliance. Ports have to track progress under the Environment Management Guidelines and Environmental Performance Indicators, gradually adopting frameworks such as the Global Reporting Initiative, within 6 to 18 months. Impact assessments and annual audits guide ports toward achieving targeted environmental, economic, and social goals. Harit Sagar encourages earning carbon credits and proposes incentives, such as priority berthing or reduced port dues for ships that use cleaner fuels or shore power. They also recognise private operators, public-private partnerships, and truck fleets that use cleaner fuels or electric vehicles.

● Linking Green Ports with India’s Blue Economy

Despite their potential to generate jobs and income, the unchecked growth of shipping, ports, fisheries, and coastal tourism without accounting for local realities can harm ecosystems and adversely affect local and indigenous communities. Harit Sagar must connect environmental protection and climate resilience with local aspirations and on-ground dynamics. Linking port development to livelihoods, ecosystem health, and meaningful community participation promotes innovative, inclusive outcomes. For example, VOC has already begun mangrove restoration by effectively involving local communities.

Implementing India’s Green Port Transformation

India is a major maritime nation. Through Harit Sagar and its work at the International Maritime Organization (IMO), the country can demonstrate how ports and shipping can become greener while continuing to support development. The guidelines can also be gradually scaled up across ports nationwide. India could share its experiences with other emerging economies and SIDS, helping them adapt and implement green port transitions to diverse contexts. For international partners, financiers, and the IMO, Harit Sagar underscores the need for phased transitions, flexible approaches, and financing strategies adapted to varied capacities.

If implemented effectively, India’s green port journey can demonstrate globally that economic growth and sustainability can go hand in hand.

Realising Harit Sagar’s vision will require a careful, step-by-step approach involving all stakeholders. Monitoring must be more transparent and consistent, green finance must grow, and investments will be needed in skills and fuel infrastructure. These initiatives require engaginglocal communities at every stage. International platforms such as the IMO, G20, and BRICS can further support fair maritime climate policies. If implemented effectively, India’s green port journey can demonstrate globally that economic growth and sustainability can go hand in hand.

Green shipping technologies, including hydrogen fuel cells and alternative fuels like ammonia and methanol, provide practical pathways to reduce emissions while maintaining operational efficiency.","The shipping industry is taking a major step toward decarbonisation as PowerCell Group joins the European GAMMA initiative.

Funded with €17m through Horizon Europe, the project aims to demonstrate how hydrogen-based fuel cells and climate-neutral fuels can transform deep-sea shipping, enabling zero-emission operations for large ocean-going vessels.

The five-year initiative is led by Icelandic engineering company Verkís and includes a consortium of European innovators, such as ANT Topic, Fraunhofer, Aurelia, Sea Green Engineering, Energy Cluster Denmark, SINTEF, and Politecnico di Milano, among others.

Richard Berkling, CEO of PowerCell Group, commented: “This project represents exactly the type of industrial learning that the maritime sector needs right now.

“GAMMA allows us to move beyond theoretical studies and demonstrate how fuel cells, hydrogen carriers, and onboard reforming can work together in a commercial vessel. That operational experience is what will ultimately de-risk adoption and unlock large-scale deployment.”

A landmark project for maritime decarbonisation

The GAMMA project – short for Green Ammonia and Biomethanol fuel MAritime Vessels – brings together 16 European partners to retrofit a 60,000 DWT bulk carrier from TOPIC Fleet.

This retrofit will convert the vessel into a full-scale testbed for green shipping technologies, replacing traditional fossil fuel generators with hydrogen-powered fuel cell systems.

PowerCell Group will supply a 1 MW-class fuel cell power system to the project, allowing the ship to generate electricity on board using hydrogen derived from green methanol and ammonia.

By integrating this system into the vessel’s auxiliary power architecture, the project will validate real-world performance, safety, durability, and system integration under the demanding conditions of deep-sea navigation.

The potential of hydrogen fuel cells to transform shipping

While battery technology can support short-range maritime applications, it cannot meet the endurance and energy requirements of deep-sea shipping.

Fuel cells powered by hydrogen and hydrogen carriers such as methanol and ammonia provide a scalable solution for zero-emission auxiliary power – and eventually, main propulsion.

The GAMMA project will cultivate essential operational data on system efficiency, reliability, safety, maintenance, and integration.

This information will guide future regulatory frameworks and commercial investments, providing confidence to shipowners, yards, and regulators about the practical feasibility of green shipping solutions.

Operational insights from full-scale demonstrations

Demonstration projects like GAMMA are vital in an industry where vessels are expected to operate for decades.

Real-world testing allows stakeholders to move beyond theoretical studies and gain hands-on experience with fuel cell systems, onboard reforming, and hydrogen carriers.

These insights help de-risk technology adoption and accelerate broader implementation in the shipping sector.

The importance of decarbonising shipping

Shipping accounts for nearly 3% of global CO₂ emissions, a number projected to rise if the industry continues relying on fossil fuels.

Decarbonising shipping is crucial not only for achieving global climate targets but also for ensuring sustainable trade practices.

#5 Clean energy supply across the value chain Zero-emission shipping requires ports and charging infrastructure to be powered by clean electricity.","With the Annual Meeting in Davos, taking place 19-23 January 2026 and focusing on how to deploy innovation at scale responsibly, the World Economic Forum (WEF) explores the key factors that will drive the creation of a financially sustainable, zero-emission global maritime ecosystem.

After centuries of dependence on fossil fuels, the shipping industry is beginning a transition to cleaner propulsion systems driven by tightening climate commitments and regulations. The International Maritime Organization has set a target for net-zero shipping emissions by around 2050, while the EU’s Fit for 55 package brings shipping into the Emissions Trading System, requiring full emissions coverage by 2027.

In response, technological advances and regulatory pressure are accelerating investment in electric and hybrid vessels, with the global electric ship market expected to grow from $4.85 billion in 2025 to $18.39 billion by 2032.

7 key factors by WEF for a sustainable maritime ecosystem

#1 Technology neutrality with clean propulsion portfolios

No single solution will decarbonize shipping. Scaling zero-emission shipping requires a diversified mix of battery-electric systems for short-sea and inland routes, alongside alternative fuels and fuel cells for deep-sea operations.

#2 Safe, high-performance energy storage systems

Advanced energy storage is central to electric shipping, determining vessel range, charging speed, reliability and overall operational viability. Systems must meet stringent maritime safety standards while delivering commercial-grade performance.

#3 Retrofittable decarbonization pathways

Newbuild vessels alone cannot deliver near-term emissions reductions. With long vessel lifetimes, retrofitting existing fleets with electric, hybrid and low-carbon technologies is essential to accelerate impact at scale.

#4 Scalable port-side charging and energy infrastructure

Electric shipping depends on reliable, standardized port-side charging or battery-swapping solutions. Without widespread infrastructure deployment, adoption remains constrained by operational risk and cost uncertainty.

#5 Clean energy supply across the value chain

Zero-emission shipping requires ports and charging infrastructure to be powered by clean electricity. Otherwise, emissions are shifted from sea to shore, undermining climate benefits and public trust.

#6 Public-private collaboration and regulatory alignment

Governments, ports, shipowners, technology providers and utilities must co-invest, align standards and share risk. Coordinated policy frameworks and joint infrastructure development are critical to achieving commercial viability.

#7 First-mover leadership and early deployment

Early adopters play a critical role in proving technologies, de-risking investments and establishing viable business models. While initial returns may be limited, early action is essential to unlock scale and long-term market transformation.

World leaders from government, business, civil society and academia will convene in Davos 19-23 January 2026, to engage in forward-looking discussions to address global issues and set priorities.

Interferry wants a pause on the further implementation of the EU ETS for the ferry sector, halting the planned increase from 70 per cent to 100 per cent in 2026.

Ferry services are critically important to Europe, transporting 400 million passengers and 200 million vehicles and freight units a year in the EU. According to Interferry, every Euro increase in the freight rate risks pushing freight volumes back to the already congested European road networks. While Interferry supports decarbonisation of the maritime industry, it accepted the EU ETS on the clear understanding collected funds would be used for decarbonisation efforts.

Interferry’s demand follows the EU Council’s decision to continue exempting road transport from a parallel ETS scheme, along with what it calls “the lack of clear regulations”’ on the distribution of the funds collected. In October 2025 the International Maritime Organization postponed the adoption of a global Greenhouse Gas (GHG) pricing mechanism for at least 12 months. This framework was intended to replace the EU ETS and would have set clear guidelines for the use of the funds collected.

“This action must remain in place until road transport is also in an ETS and funds collected are actually ringfenced for maritime decarbonisation,” said Mike Corrigan, CEO of Interferry. “The EU must deliver on its promise of a level playing field and ensure its climate policy supports, rather than financially drains, its most forward-looking transport sector.”

Johan Roos, director regulatory affairs at Interferry, said the exemption of road transport from the EU ETS creates an “immediate, severe competitive disadvantage” for ro-ro and passenger ferries.

“As it stands now, ETS creates an adverse incentive, pushing goods and passengers back onto already congested road networks due to higher ferry costs,” he said. “This directly contradicts the long-standing EU policy of modal shift from road to sea. The EU ETS is taxing intra-EU ferry transport by approximately €1 billion ($1.17 billion) per year, while we need support for production of e-fuels and substantial investments in electrification of EU ports for the benefit of charging electric-propulsion ships. Instead, the vast majority of these revenues are being diverted to national Member State budgets. This approach neither promotes competitivity nor cohesion and hinders the industry’s ability to invest in cleaner technologies.”",https://www.cruiseandferry.net/Portals/0/EasyDNNnews/16049/InterferryEUETS_web.jpeg,N,,2026-01-20 09:57:33.621278

“One is scattering solar radiation, causing a cooling effect on Earth’s climate,” Jin said.
“When we have more sulfate aerosols, or more cloud nuclei, the cloud droplets become smaller,” he said.
“This is an even bigger impact of changes in ship-emitted sulfate aerosols,” he said.
Our study in 2021 shows that starting around 2010, we observed a decreasing trend in sulfate aerosols and other aerosol species.","LAWRENCE — Cuts in sulfur emissions from oceangoing vessels have been tied to a reduction in lightning stroke density along heavily trafficked shipping routes in the Bay of Bengal and the South China Sea, according to new research from the University of Kansas.

Previous studies had found frequent lightning along shipping routes over the Bay of Bengal before a 2020 International Maritime Organization rule capped sulfur in fuel used by oceangoing ships, leading to a roughly 70% drop in sulfate emissions in the Bay of Bengal.

“I think there are two reasons for this,” said lead author Qinjian Jin, assistant teaching professor of geography & atmospheric science at KU. “The first is the shipping activity is so frequent that it releases a lot of sulfate aerosols, more than other oceanic regions. The second is that the Bay of Bengal is an area where we see lots of strong convection that is required for lightning to occur. I think both reasons contribute to the observed frequent lightning activity over this region.”

Jin said these two ocean regions best revealed the connection between shipping emissions and lightning. The KU researcher and his colleagues found lightning-stroke density — the number of individual lightning discharges, or “strokes,” per square kilometer — to be about 36% lower than before the 2020 IMO sulfur cap.

“The drop in sulfates from ships can cause fewer cloud condensation nuclei, larger cloud drops, weaker convection and storms, and thus fewer ice crystals and less frequent lightning,” Jin said.

The findings were published in the peer-reviewed journal Climate and Atmospheric Science. Jin’s co-authors were Jianping Huang of Lanzhou University in Lanzhou, China; Jiangfeng Wei of Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology in Nanjing, China; and Bing Pu, KU associate professor of geography & atmospheric science.

A similar drop in lightning strokes was detected along other busy shipping routes, according to their findings.

“There is another region very close to the Bay of Bengal, which is the South China Sea,” Jin said. “We see very similar enhanced lightning there. Another region is a very small area in the Red Sea. We see a very weak signal there, not as strong as in the Bay of Bengal and the South China Sea.”

The lightning data used come from a network called the World Wide Lightning Location Network, produced by the University of Washington.

“That network has been developed for more than a decade, starting in the early 2000s,” Jin said. “It provides very high-resolution lightning data. It is global data. Based on this dataset, the phenomenon of lightning decrease has been observed in those regions.”

According to Jin, sulfate aerosols in the atmosphere, emitted naturally or from human activities, have two major climatic impacts.

“One is scattering solar radiation, causing a cooling effect on Earth’s climate,” Jin said. “The other is modifying cloud microphysical properties, such as cloud droplet size and cloud droplet number concentration. By changing clouds, they can also influence radiation.”

Jin explained that once sulfate aerosols are released into the atmosphere, they can act as cloud nuclei, which is the mechanism by which sulfates released in ship exhaust can boost lightning strokes.

“When we have more sulfate aerosols, or more cloud nuclei, the cloud droplets become smaller,” he said. “When they’re smaller, it’s harder for precipitation to occur. Clouds can last longer in the atmosphere. With a longer lifetime, they have a higher chance to develop into high clouds, where ice clouds form. When we have more ice clouds, we have a higher chance of lightning. That is how sulfate aerosols can be connected to lightning.”

While the 2020 regulations on shipping were intended to clean up the air, the reduction in lightning can be seen as a side benefit, as lightning can be dangerous to mariners and equipment, and can hinder visibility and normal operations at sea. Jin said another consequence of the shipping regulation might be warmer global temperatures.

“Due to the 2020 emission regulation imposed by the International Maritime Organization, we observed a decrease in sulfur emissions from ships after 2020,” he said. “With less sulfate aerosol emitted from ships, we observed darker clouds over the North Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. Because clouds become darker, they absorb more solar radiation. Our previous studies imply that the decrease in shipping sulfate aerosols could be responsible for the record-breaking global warming temperatures in 2023 and 2024.”

Jin said his future research will aim to better understand this potential effect.

“This is an even bigger impact of changes in ship-emitted sulfate aerosols,” he said. “Most current studies use modeling simulations with global climate models. One drawback of global climate models is their coarse spatial resolution, which have limited ability to resolve boundary layer cloud processes in the atmosphere. That affects the accuracy of aerosol impacts on radiation and clouds. In the future, I plan to use regional climate models with high spatial resolutions. These can resolve cloud formation, especially stratocumulus clouds, which are low clouds and very reflective. With high-resolution regional climate models, we can have a better estimation of the impacts of the decrease in ship-emitted sulfate aerosols on global temperature increase.”

Further, Jin plans to study the effects of regulations by nations in Asia that cut sulfate emissions beginning about 15 years ago.

“Based on our results, we know that with less sulfate aerosol, we could have less lightning activity,” he said. “This is a very important conclusion.

“This action must remain in place until road transport is also in an ETS and funds collected are actually ringfenced for maritime decarbonisation.
“As it stands now, ETS creates an adverse incentive, pushing goods and passengers back onto already congested road networks due to higher ferry costs.
“The EU ETS is taxing intra-EU ferry transport by approximately €1.0Bn (US$1.2Bn) per year, while we need support for the production of e-fuels and substantial investments in the electrification of EU ports for the benefit of charging electric-propulsion ships.
This approach neither promotes competitivity nor cohesion and hinders the industry’s ability to invest in cleaner technologies,” added Mr Roos.","The demand follows the recent decision to continue exempting road transport from a parallel ETS mechanism, and a lack of clear regulations on the distribution of the funds collected, Interferry said.

“This action must remain in place until road transport is also in an ETS and funds collected are actually ringfenced for maritime decarbonisation. The EU must deliver on its promise of a level playing field and ensure its climate policy supports, rather than financially drains, its most forward-looking transport sector,” said Interferry chief executive Mike Corrigan.

More than half of the world’s gross roro- and passenger ship tonnage operates in European waters, transporting 400M passengers and 200M vehicles and freight units every year within the EU, stated Interferry, significantly offloading the road network. It added, “Every euro of freight rate increase on ferries risks pushing freight volumes back to the already congested European road networks.”

Interferry said it supports decarbonising the maritime industry and accepted the EU ETS on the “clear understanding that funds collected would actually be used for decarbonisation and that road transport would also soon be included”.

The statement added, “The EU Council recently decided to postpone the inclusion of road transport – raising significant concerns in the shortsea shipping sector as to why end users of maritime transports, eg island communities, have to carry the full costs of ETS.”

“This exemption of road transport from the EU ETS creates an immediate, severe competitive disadvantage for roro and passenger ferries,” said Interferry director regulatory affairs Johan Roos. “As it stands now, ETS creates an adverse incentive, pushing goods and passengers back onto already congested road networks due to higher ferry costs. This directly contradicts the long-standing EU policy of modal shift from road to sea.”

In October 2025, IMO postponed the adoption of a global greenhouse gas pricing mechanism for at least 12 months – a framework that was intended to replace the EU ETS and would have set clear guidelines for the use of the funds collected. Meanwhile, Interferry members operating to and from EU ports are taxed for their CO2 emissions without a clear provision on how the money is reinvested to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, and without certainty when a global IMO regulation will come into force – if at all.

“The EU ETS is taxing intra-EU ferry transport by approximately €1.0Bn (US$1.2Bn) per year, while we need support for the production of e-fuels and substantial investments in the electrification of EU ports for the benefit of charging electric-propulsion ships. Instead, the vast majority of these revenues are being diverted to national member state budgets.

The European Hydrogen Bank is an initiative to facilitate the EU's domestic production and imports of renewable hydrogen.
Under the first renewable hydrogen auction (IF23 Auction), six projects signed their grant agreements in 2024 and five of them have now entered the implementation phase, producing renewable hydrogen used in sectors such as steel, chemicals, maritime transport, and fertilisers.","Six projects selected in the 2024 Innovation Fund Auction for renewable hydrogen production (IF24 Auction) have signed their grant agreements, receiving a total of €270.6 million, sourced from EU Emissions Trading System revenues. Two of these projects were awarded under the dedicated maritime topic, receiving more than €35 million to supply renewable hydrogen to maritime off-takers.

The auction operates under the domestic pillar of the European Hydrogen Bank, which aims to scale up European hydrogen production and strengthen market integration. It supports the replacement of natural gas, coal and oil in hard-to-decarbonise industries and transport sectors. The awarded funding will help these projects bridge the difference between their production costs and the price that industrial users are willing to pay for their product. This market-based design also aims to reduce risks for investors and lessen the administrative burden for applicants.

The hydrogen produced is renewable fuel of non-biological origin (RFNBO) and is expected to be used in key sectors like chemical industry and mobility, mostly in helping decarbonise maritime and heavy-duty transport. Together, these projects are projected to produce around 500 kilotonnes of renewable hydrogen, cutting almost 3.4 million tonnes of CO₂ emissions over an operational period of 10 years.

The projects are located in Spain, Finland, and Norway, and will install a total of 381.25 megawatts of electrolyser capacity. The individual grant values range from €135.5 million to €1.8 million for installations with a megawatt electric (MWe) capacity from 5 to 200 MWe. The awarded projects presented bids going from €0.33 to €1.88 per kilogram of RFNBO Hydrogen.

Meet the new projects

** Calculated based on the 2021-2025 ETS benchmark of 6.84 tons CO2e/tH2, not taking into account additional carbon abatement due to substitution effects in the H2 end use application (i.e., conservative estimate)

Auctions as a Service

In parallel, Spain, Lithuania, and Austria allocated up to €836 million in national funding for projects in their countries through the Innovation Fund’s ‘Auctions-as-a-service' feature. This allows Member States to identify and fund eligible projects in their territories that meet the qualification criteria but cannot be funded by the Innovation Fund due to budgetary limitations.

‘Auctions-as-a-Service' is open to all Member States, enabling them to benefit from the EU-level auction platform and award national funding to additional projects with a simplified procedure. Projects awarded by participating Member States will be announced by the respective national authorities.

Next Steps

The European Climate, Infrastructure and Environment Executive Agency (CINEA) will accompany the projects throughout the development phase, ensuring compliance with Innovation Fund requirements and supporting smooth progress toward financial close and construction.

The IF24 Auction provides a fixed premium per kilogram of certified and verified renewable hydrogen (RFNBO) produced. Signed projects must reach financial close within two and a half years and start producing renewable hydrogen within five years. They will receive the fixed premium for up to ten years, based on certified and verified RFNBO hydrogen production.

The European Hydrogen Bank is already working on the next cycle: the third Innovation Fund Hydrogen Auction was launched on 4 December 2025 with a budget of up to €1.3 billion. The deadline to submit proposals is 19 February, 17:00 CET via the EU Funding & Tenders Portal.

Background

The Innovation Fund is one of the world’s largest funding programmes for the deployment of innovative net-zero technologies, with an estimated budget of €40 billion from the revenues of auctioning allowances under the EU Emissions Trading System between 2020 and 2030.

The European Hydrogen Bank is an initiative to facilitate the EU's domestic production and imports of renewable hydrogen. It aims to unlock private investment in the EU and in third countries by addressing investment challenges, closing the funding gap, and connecting a future renewable hydrogen supply to consumers.

Under the first renewable hydrogen auction (IF23 Auction), six projects signed their grant agreements in 2024 and five of them have now entered the implementation phase, producing renewable hydrogen used in sectors such as steel, chemicals, maritime transport, and fertilisers.

This review examines recent technological, regulatory, and market-driven developments in corn- and sugarcane-based ethanol production, with emphasis on advances realised between 2023 and 2025.

In corn ethanol systems, enzyme-enabled process enhancements have improved starch and fibre conversion efficiency, increasing ethanol yields without additional land use while simultaneously strengthening coproduct markets such as distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS) and biochar. Parallel progress in carbon capture and storage has enabled ethanol producers to enter voluntary carbon markets, reducing lifecycle carbon intensity and improving economic resilience.

In sugarcane ethanol, the integration of second-generation (2G) pathways using agricultural residues has expanded operational windows and improved overall resource efficiency, while advances in genetic improvement techniques have accelerated yield gains and climate adaptability.

These technological developments have been reinforced by evolving blending mandates and renewable fuel policies in major markets, including Brazil, the European Union, and emerging aviation and marine fuel sectors.

Collectively, these changes explain the surge in investment and capacity expansion observed globally and signal a transition of ethanol from a compliance fuel towards a strategically optimised, low-carbon energy carrier. Understanding these converging drivers is essential for guiding future research, industrial deployment, and policy design in biofuel systems.

Introduction

The transport industry produces significant greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, such as CO₂ and methane.

These gases absorb and re-emit infrared radiation, trapping heat in the atmosphere and contributing to global warming and climate change. As a result, renewable and environmentally sustainable fuels are increasingly important.

Ethanol, derived from corn and sugarcane, is already widely used and, in some cases, mandated in the global fuel industry.

Corn and sugarcane are used to produce ethanol because they are rich in fermentable carbohydrates and have well-established production methods.

A factor limiting sugarcane’s global spread is the climate required for cultivation.

Recent advances in biofuel technology include improved enzymes, higher-yield crops and processes that use crop residues to boost yields.

These developments, alongside renewable energy and carbon-reduction efforts, are strengthening collaboration in the sector.

Despite these developments, there remains a need to examine and consolidate the latest progress in biofuel technologies, particularly over the past three years.

Therefore, this review highlights the major technological and sustainability-driven innovations in ethanol during this period. Understanding these advances is essential for future research, global sustainability, and industrial optimisation in the sector.

Advances in corn-based ethanol

2.1. Enzyme and process enhancement

Over the past three years, significant effort has been directed towards developing techniques to improve yield without expanding land use.

Enzyme technology is a key solution: specific enzymes are now applied directly to the crop or during processing, boosting DDGS (distillers’ dried grains) and ethanol production by facilitating more efficient breakdown of plant material, as shown in Table 1.

This technology is estimated to increase overall ethanol production by 10% [2]. Crucially, these enzymes require only a financial investment, as no additional machinery or space is needed to realise these gains.

2.2. Co-product valorisation

With the rise in biochar production, used in carbon removal technologies, the supply chain was unable to keep pace.

This necessitated expanded intake to support higher production. The expansion focused on residues produced by ethanol plants, which began selling these materials.

Even with ethanol production “waste” being used in biochar production, by 2024 approximately 62% of supply had already been sold, with 28% presold for 2026. This raised prices and generated additional revenue for ethanol producers.

Not only has biochar increased in price, but DDGS has risen as well and is expected to grow by 7.3% from 2025 to 2030, as shown in Figure 1.

This increase in value can be attributed to several factors: governments have begun requiring and encouraging the use of DDGS in livestock nutrition through subsidies and awareness campaigns.

Another factor is price, which is estimated to be 10–15% lower than soybeans, another widely used livestock meal.

To meet this demand, industries have begun investing in machinery upgrades, such as fractionation systems that remove fibre and increase digestibility, now being installed in distilleries [3].

2.3. Carbon intensity reduction

One method for distilleries to offset their environmental footprint is through government carbon credits.

These credits were once considered unattainable due to gas emissions. However, in 2024, the first ethanol plant voluntarily entered carbon markets [4]. Red Trail Energy laid the groundwork for future facilities.

In corn ethanol production, yeast ferments corn starch, producing ethanol, solids, and a high-purity carbon dioxide (CO₂) stream as by-products. The CO₂ that would otherwise be released into the atmosphere is captured.

Exhaust gas from fermentation vessels is directed to a capture facility, where it is purified, compressed into liquid form, and dehydrated to remove impurities.

The liquefied CO₂ is then transported through a flowline to an onsite injection well and injected into the Broom Creek Formation, a secure sandstone layer approximately 6,500 feet below the facility, where it is intended to be permanently stored [5,6].

Advances in sugarcane-based ethanol

3.1. 2G sugarcane

The integration of 2G production facilities with existing 1G mills involves using sugarcane residues, including leaves, bagasse, vinasse, and filter cake [7]. These residues are not fully utilised in 1G processes [8].

Including sugarcane bagasse also reduces the need for additional cultivation areas.

First-generation production occurs for only about nine to ten months per year. Including second-generation residues enables ethanol plants to operate year-round, thereby improving efficiency.

Investments in Brazil are also closely monitoring research into generating electrical energy from bagasse, as shown in Table 3 [9]. This could be essential for reducing future plant costs.

3.2. Genetic improvements

Genetically modified sugarcane traits aim to boost yield, pest resistance, and adaptability to new climates.

Methods such as CRISPR-based breeding and marker-assisted selection help improve traits while minimising unintended outcomes [10]. Classical breeding can take 15 to 17 years [11] and requires large quantities of plant material, much of which is wasted due to genetic or breeding failures.

With modern techniques, researchers can directly modify the genetic code of the plant, reducing the time required to achieve desired sugarcane traits.

Emerging trends and market effects - Laws mandating increased ethanol consumption

More countries, economic groups, and states are opening their energy systems to biofuels. Brazil has approved a law increasing ethanol content in petrol from 27.5% to 35% [12].

Biodiesel is rising from 15% to 25%. The most significant change is in aviation, with a 1% blend starting in 2027, rising to 10% in 2037 and increasing by 1% annually thereafter.

In Europe, the EU is finalising its ethanol blending policies, with a 2030 target of 5.5% renewable fuel [13].

In the US, there is no mandatory ethanol percentage, although financial regulations such as waivers influence consumer behaviour [14]. The transition from E10 to E15, along with expanded availability, further demonstrates growing demand.

Future demand for water and air

Biofuels are commonly used in land transport but less frequently in aviation and maritime sectors. This is beginning to change.

Cargo ships have started blending biodiesel onboard [16], improving fuel properties and usability. Ethanol’s higher solubility in water presents additional handling considerations.

MIT researchers are also developing aviation fuel from biomass [17], creating another pathway for broader biofuel adoption.

Beyond regulatory drivers, expanding use in maritime and aviation introduces challenges related to fuel handling, moisture control, and emissions. Ethanol-based fuels are more hygroscopic than petroleum fuels, requiring improved storage and monitoring systems.

Integrated fuel management strategies, including controlled blending, adaptive combustion tuning, and real-time quality monitoring, will support safe and efficient use. These developments indicate that future biofuel deployment depends not only on chemistry, but also on infrastructure and operational co-evolution.

Market reaction

Biofuel companies are actively positioning themselves for future growth. INPASA, Latin America’s largest biorefinery company, currently produces up to 5.6 billion litres of ethanol annually [19].

It owns the world’s largest biorefinery and plans further expansion, investing nearly one billion dollars into facility upgrades [20].

Their actions demonstrate confidence in the sector’s future. Financial markets increasingly factor carbon intensity and regulatory alignment into investment decisions. ~

Producers demonstrating emissions reductions and coproduct integration are better positioned for favourable financing.

The market is shifting towards scale and integration, with larger facilities benefiting from economies of scale and improved logistics.

As consolidation continues, standardisation and transparency are expected to increase. These trends confirm that biofuels are transitioning from a niche option to a mature component of global energy systems.

Conclusion

Between 2023 and 2025, the corn- and sugarcane-based ethanol sector has made clear progress through increased production, stronger coproduct markets, and supportive policies. Enzyme technologies have boosted ethanol output by approximately 10%.

Biochar accounted for 62% of 2024 supply, with 28% already sold for 2026. DDGS prices remain 10–15% lower than soybean prices and are expected to rise by 7.3% between 2025 and 2030.

For sugarcane ethanol, second-generation processes now enable year-round operation. Policy changes, including Brazil’s ethanol blend increase and the EU’s renewable fuel targets, demonstrate rising adoption.

These developments show that the sector is becoming more efficient, environmentally responsible, and economically competitive. Researchers, policymakers, and industry leaders can use these insights to further accelerate progress towards low-carbon transport. These factors collectively explain the growth in investment observed in the biofuel sector over the past three years.

The alliance of 24 not-for-profit organisations is urging delegates at SDC 12 to prioritise technical work that directly enables policy action on underwater radiated noise, warning that delays risk leaving ship operators without clear guidance as traffic intensifies in sensitive regions.

Shipping noise, largely generated by propellers and engines, interferes with navigation, feeding and communication for marine species that rely on sound, with marine mammals particularly exposed.

The Arctic, historically characterised by minimal human-sourced noise, is seeing a steady rise in acoustic pressure as vessel activity expands.

One submission before SDC 12 introduces new maps identifying migratory corridors of Arctic whales across the Arctic Ocean. These corridors are recognised in IMO instruments as areas of special concern due to high concentrations of noise-sensitive species.

The material is intended to inform voyage planning during peak migration seasons in spring and autumn, supporting operational measures such as speed reduction and rerouting alongside technical ship modifications.

A separate paper examines potential underwater noise impacts linked to LNG tanker traffic associated with proposed LNG developments in the Gulf of California.

The analysis considers effects on resident and migratory whales, as well as related air quality and greenhouse gas impacts. The expected rise in tanker movements would introduce heavy traffic into ecologically sensitive waters, increasing risks from continuous underwater noise.

The organisations argue that the Arctic and the Gulf of California face parallel challenges: both regions historically experienced low shipping density, and both are now exposed to sharp increases that could cause irreversible harm to marine habitats.

A recent study from Edinburgh Business School at Heriot-Watt University found that while hydrogen production, storage and fuel cell technologies are advancing rapidly, the hydrogen distribution infrastructure is developing at half the speed, creating a critical bottleneck that could put billions in clean energy at risk.

The findings, published in the journal Sustainable Futures, are an important milestone in recognising that, while other hydrogen technologies improve and costs fall, distribution expenses could take up a large share of hydrogen system budgets, significantly limiting overall efficiency and growth of the hydrogen sector, the university researchers said.

The research team analysed 777,000 patents and 1.3 million citations spanning 182 years of hydrogen technology development, revealing clear differences in progress across the system.

The findings reveal where the hydrogen system is most vulnerable showcasing that pipes, terminals and liquefaction plants needed to move hydrogen safely and affordably are lagging behind.

As a result, the researchers said, “distribution is what links the entire hydrogen system together” and “without it, production stays concentrated near manufacturing sites”, meaning the “wider economy cannot make use of it and the climate benefits never materialise”, the researchers added.

Dr David Dekker, a research fellow at Edinburgh Business School, Heriot-Watt University and the paper’s lead author, said:

“Distribution will become the dominant cost in any hydrogen system. Even as we get better at producing and using hydrogen, getting it where it’s needed stays expensive.

“The problem is structural. Distribution requires massive pipeline networks and liquefaction plants that need billions in capital investment. Safety regulations and permitting processes are complex, so progress is slow.

“Most distribution infrastructure sits with a handful of major companies. They tend to share less knowledge than innovators in other hydrogen fields. In capital-intensive sectors where competitive advantage matters, companies are far less likely to publish innovations openly. This slows progress across the entire sector.”

Professor Dimitris Christopoulos who co-authored the findings is director of research for the Edinburgh Business School and Heriot-Watt University’s School of Social Science, said:

“We cannot have a hydrogen economy without the infrastructure to move it around. Right now, that is the fundamental missing piece.

“The 2015 Paris Agreement requires rapid scaling of clean energy technologies, but infrastructure bottlenecks could undermine major investment programmes. The question now is whether policymakers and industry will act before distribution costs make hydrogen uncompetitive.”

Professor Mercedes Maroto-Valer who leads the UK Industrial Decarbonisation Research and Innovation Centre (IDRIC), said:

“As the BBC recently reported on Germany’s green hydrogen industry, hydrogen faces a classic chicken-and-egg problem: industry won’t commit at scale without pipelines, terminals and reliable delivery, but those networks won’t be built at scale without firm industrial demand.

“What this new Heriot-Watt research adds is hard evidence that distribution innovation moves much more slowly than the rest of the hydrogen system, so without targeted action to de-risk infrastructure, the distribution costs and uncertainty will keep holding the market back.”",https://transportandenergy.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Hydrogen-infrastructure-credit-Istock.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 11:57:11.406285

On the one hand, the US has moved with remarkable aggression to block the International Maritime Organization’s attempt to impose a global carbon pricing mechanism on shipping.

The rhetoric has been theatrical, casting the proposal as an inflationary “global tax” that would ultimately land on American consumers. Threats of retaliation, ranging from tariffs to port fees and even visa measures, have hovered over the negotiations, turning what is usually a technocratic UN forum into something closer to a trade skirmish. The message is clear: global levies dreamed up in London and Brussels will not be allowed to dictate costs to US industry.

Yet step away from the IMO chamber and the picture looks rather different. Domestically, the US is hardly in denial about the need to decarbonise shipping. The proposed Clean Shipping Act of 2025, with some remants of its National Blueprint for Transportation Decarbonisation, would push the sector towards net zero by mid-century through fuel carbon-intensity standards set by the Environmental Protection Agency.

Washington is also enthusiastic about alternative fuels, particularly those that can be produced at home. Biofuels, including ethanol, are politically attractive because they align climate goals with farm-state economics, even if questions about scalability and lifecycle emissions remain.

Synthetic e-fuels sit comfortably within the US narrative of technological prowess, while green hydrogen and ammonia are treated as long-term strategic bets rather than near-term fixes. American diplomats are perfectly happy to champion green shipping corridors and initiatives such as the Clydebank Declaration (albeit a signatory before Trump’s inaugration) so long as they are framed as partnerships and pilots rather than tax regimes.

What looks like incoherence is better understood as a preference for control. The US is not rejecting decarbonisation; it is rejecting the idea that decarbonisation should be enforced through a global price signal beyond its influence. Washington would rather see markets shaped at home, innovation subsidised domestically and exporters given the chance to turn climate policy into an industrial opportunity.

The irony is that parts of the US fuel industry see the IMO framework as a gift, a ready-made global market for American low-carbon fuels. But that kind of opportunity only appeals if it comes without a supranational cashier.

To facilitate this transition, the availability of clean fuel supplies, along with adequate storage and bunkering infrastructure, is crucial. Transparency and stability in regulations will be essential for both producers and consumers of green fuels to ensure compliance with EU targets.

Madoqua, a Luso-Dutch company, is making strides in the Power-to-X (PtX) sector, aimed at producing and marketing hydrogen and its derivatives such as green ammonia and e-methanol. Central to their efforts is the Madoqua Green Fuels Terminal, a key infrastructure component designed to connect Portugal with Northern Europe.

In late 2024, Madoqua partnered with the Ports of Sines, Rotterdam, and Duisport to establish a green fuels corridor. They are collaborating with industry partners, including Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners and Mitsui O.S.K. Lines, to explore innovative business models and share risks in this energy transition. The company is open to partnerships that contribute socio-economic value and foster sustainable coexistence.

Current progress in developing the green fuels corridor includes the creation of an Ammonia Bunkering Operations Manual to facilitate the safe adoption of ammonia in marine fuel. Madoqua is concluding a feasibility study on the green fuels terminal in Sines, for which they have received support from the EU via the Connecting Europe Facility. While the ammonia storage component is advancing, the project faces challenges related to ensuring continuous product flow to stimulate demand.

Madoqua’s terminal will initially focus on ammonia storage and is based on an open-access model to unlock regional green fuel projects. Their green ammonia project has a phase one target of 500 MW of electrolysis capacity, with additional grid access secured for expanded production.

Regulatory frameworks such as the upcoming FuelEU Maritime regulation are poised to impact green fuel production and bunkering infrastructure significantly. A future demand for renewables in maritime fuels mandates a substantial acceleration in production capacity, as establishing new facilities is time-intensive.

Looking ahead, Madoqua sees opportunities for more green fuel corridors arising, particularly as EU support increases for public-private collaborations. The Global South is identified as a potential source for green fuel supply, particularly in regions like Morocco and Namibia, although core infrastructure development remains a barrier.

Challenges such as price discrepancies and regulatory inadequacies can hinder the maritime industry’s transition to green fuels.

Currently, e-methanol accounts for only about 2% of green methanol production because it is “difficult to compete on cost today”, Leisner said.
The ship departed the Philippines on 15 January and will bunker green methanol in Singapore, then proceed to Western Australia before sailing onward to Europe.
“We know the road to low carbon shipping will require a mix of solutions and green methanol is one part of that portfolio,” Dieleman continued.
Methanol orders fell to 61 from 149 in 2024, while ammonia and LPG saw only limited order uptake.","Baltic Exchange on Tuesday (13 January) released an article by Carly Fields discussing methanol as a marine fuel, availability of low-GHG methanol and challenges in the development of e-methanol:

In the race to re-fuel the shipping industry with environmental alternatives to heavy fuel oil, methanol has its staunch supporters. The greener, leaner fuel also has a firm foundation to build on.

Marius Leisner, senior principal consultant in the Environmental Advisory unit at DNV, said methanol boasts a “ten-year track record as a marine fuel”, which provides a level of comfort that other alternatives, such as ammonia or hydrogen, currently lack. This equates to a robust technological foundation, with ship designs and fuel-system integration strategies having matured significantly through the recent influx of methanol-capable vessels in the global order book.

One of the primary drivers behind the mounting interest in methanol is its relative ease of handling. In a world where gaseous fuels present significant logistical and safety hurdles, methanol’s liquid state is a distinct advantage, Leisner notes.

“Being a liquid, methanol is simpler and, I would say, safer to store, transport, and bunker than gaseous fuels such as LNG, ammonia, and hydrogen.”

Furthermore, its volumetric energy intensity compares favourably to other green alternatives, being “similar to ammonia and higher than hydrogen”.

Historically, the adoption of methanol has been driven by local environmental compliance rather than global carbon reduction. Early pioneers used it to meet stringent sulphur and nitrogen oxide standards. As Leisner explained: “Methanol is sulphur-free and fully complies with MARPOL Annex VI SOx standards”.

Low-GHG methanol drive

But while it burns cleanly, generating “very little soot or particulate matter,” it is not a silver bullet for greenhouse gases in its conventional form. When produced from fossil sources, methanol’s “total well-to-wake GHG intensity is generally worse than fuel oil, Leisner said. The true promise lies in the transition to bio-methanol and e-methanol, which “can be produced from non-fossil sources with near-zero well-to-wake emissions”. However, the current landscape reveals a significant gap between capability and practice. Leisner points out that “most vessels capable of using methanol today still operate on fuel oil or fossil methanol, with only limited uptake of low-GHG methanol”.

The availability of low-GHG methanol is currently the bottleneck of the movement. While the world’s production capacity for green methanol sits at approximately 2.2 million tonnes per year—98% of which is bio-methanol—the actual bunkering volumes reported since 2023 remain “far lower” than this capacity. This suggests that while the fuel exists, the market mechanisms to put it into tanks are lagging. There is, however, cause for optimism on the horizon. If current investment decisions hold, “production capacity could increase to around 14 million tonnes by 2030, mainly driven by projects in China”, Leisner said.

Infrastructure is one area where methanol benefits from a head start. It is already one of the most widely shipped chemical commodities on the planet, with storage capacity existing in “over 115 ports worldwide”. The logistical chain is further strengthening as “dedicated methanol bunkering vessels are also emerging, with 12 currently in operation and six more on order”, Leisner said. From this perspective, the physical infrastructure is largely ready; the challenge is the price tag.

“Fundamentally, it comes down to fuel cost,” he said.

The economic gulf between fossil fuels and green alternatives remains vast. In 2025, bio-methanol prices in Rotterdam were recorded at roughly “three times the cost of marine gas oil”.

While organisations like the Methanol Institute and IRENA project that prices could fall significantly by 2050 as technology scales, the immediate future requires more than just hope for lower costs.

e-Methanol hurdles

The development of e-methanol, which utilises renewable electricity and captured carbon, faces even steeper hurdles. Currently, e-methanol accounts for only about 2% of green methanol production because it is “difficult to compete on cost today”, Leisner said. The low energy efficiency in converting green electricity into fuel remains the fundamental technical conundrum for all e-fuels. Despite this, a large portion of the future production pipeline is dedicated to e-methanol, as its ability to “approach zero GHG intensity” may justify its premium price under stricter future regulations.

To bridge this economic divide, the industry is looking toward regulators to provide the necessary “carrot” or “stick.” DNV’s modelling suggests that without strong intervention, methanol-capable ships will simply continue to burn fossil fuels to protect their bottom lines.

Leisner states that scaling will require “stronger and more sustained demand signals, such as long-term offtake agreements with defined prices and volumes, to give producers confidence to invest”.

The regulatory landscape is currently made up of two key frameworks. The FuelEU Maritime initiative provides an “important but limited demand signal”, with projected methanol use rising to between five and twelve million tonnes by 2040. In contrast, the IMO’s Net-Zero Framework represents a much more aggressive path. Under this framework, uptake is much faster, reaching 20 to 50 million tonnes. However, the recent decision to postpone the implementation of the IMO framework has left many in the industry, including DNV, feeling frustrated. Leisner admits that “a decision providing certainty would have been very helpful”.

The future of methanol in shipping is essentially a race against time and policy. The technological readiness is “largely there”, Leisner said, with major engine manufacturers like Wärtsilä and MAN already having accumulated hundreds of thousands of running hours on methanol systems. The order book is healthy, with approximately 370 methanol-capable vessels set to join the global fleet.

What remains missing is the economic bridge that allows shipowners to choose the green option without compromising their commercial viability. As Leisner concludes, the transition depends on how much of the fleet’s capacity is “actually used for low-GHG methanol rather than fossil fuels”. Until the price of carbon or the incentives for green fuel reach a tipping point, methanol will remain a promising solution waiting for the market to catch up to its potential.

Cargill on Thursday (15 January) announced the maiden voyage of Brave Pioneer, the first of five green methanol dual-fuel dry bulk vessels chartered by the company.

The deployment of the Brave Pioneer marks another important milestone in Cargill’s broader decarbonization efforts – one focused on innovation, testing and learning as the company works with customers and partners to refine future-ready solutions for Cargill and the industry.

Built by Tsuneishi Shipbuilding Co., Ltd. and owned by Mitsui & Co. Ltd., Brave Pioneer is equipped to operate on both conventional marine fuels and green methanol, a lower-carbon alternative. The estimated CO2 saving of using green methanol compared to conventional fuel is up to 70%.

The ship departed the Philippines on 15 January and will bunker green methanol in Singapore, then proceed to Western Australia before sailing onward to Europe. Through Brave Pioneer’s maiden voyage, Cargill will conduct a series of operational trials designed evaluate methanol bunkering readiness, understand how environmental attributes can be traced and verified through carbon accounting systems, and assess market appetite for low-carbon freight services.

“Decarbonising global shipping requires a mix of technologies and the willingness to take bold steps before the entire ecosystem is ready,” said Jan Dieleman, President of Cargill’s Ocean Transportation business.

“Technologies like green methanol or wind-assisted propulsion come with uncertainty. But as an industry leader, we have a responsibility to test these innovations on the water, share what we learn, and help shape the systems and standards that will enable wider adoption.”

The launch of Brave Pioneer paves the way for the four additional vessels that will join Cargill’s fleet over the coming years. The addition of these vessels strengthens Cargill’s multi-solution decarbonization approach, which includes wind-assisted propulsion, voyage optimisation technologies, energy-efficiency retrofits and exploration of alternative fuels such as biofuels and ethanol.

Each represents another step in the company’s broader efforts to embed sustainability into global ocean supply chains and support customers looking for practical, lower-carbon freight options.

“We know the road to low carbon shipping will require a mix of solutions and green methanol is one part of that portfolio,” Dieleman continued. “Our new fleet is about optionality and adaptability. These vessels are engineered to perform at a best-in-class level on conventional fuel today, while allowing us to switch to greener fuels as availability improves. It’s a practical way to future-proof ocean transport.”

As one of the world’s largest charterers of dry bulk freight, Cargill’s actions send a strong demand signal to the market and serve as an open invitation for others in the maritime sector to join in advancing the transition to sustainable shipping.

The initiative supports Cargill’s broader effort to reduce supply chain emissions and invest and test practical innovations that advance progress toward a more sustainable global food system. Green methanol-enabled vessels—paired with the eventual expansion of renewable fuel supply—are expected to play a meaningful role in reducing maritime emissions over the coming decade

Classification society DNV on Monday (12 January) said the latest annual data from its Alternative Fuels Insight (AFI) platform reflects a year shaped by regulatory uncertainty and market recalibration.

While overall newbuilding activity eased in 2025 following an unprecedented boom the previous year, its share of gross tonnage (GT) on alternative fuels held steady at 38%. This stability hinged on continued strength in the container segment, and is to a lesser degree also supported by orders in passenger vessels and PCTCs.

A total of 275 orders for alternative-fuelled vessels were placed in 2025, representing a year-on-year decrease of 47%. This mirrored a broader drop in the overall newbuild market, which fell to 2,403 orders, from 4,405 in 2024.

Despite this downturn, containership contracting showed resilience, rising to 547 new orders from 447 in 2024 and accounting for roughly 49% of all gross tonnage and 68% of alternative-fuel new orders. Within the container segment, alternative fuels dominated, with the fuel mix by tonnage approximately 58 percent LNG, 36% conventional fuels, and 6% methanol.

Knut Ørbeck-Nilssen, CEO Maritime at DNV, said: “While indicative of a turbulent year where strategic choices were harder to make, the slowdown in 2025 also reflects a natural reduction after several years of extraordinary ordering activity. Still, in select segments the momentum toward use of alternative fuels remains. Looking ahead, progress will depend on effective and global regulations that incentivize alternative fuel uptake, create a level playing field, and foster fair competition and implementation.”

Reflecting the container segment’s strength, LNG-fuelled vessels led the alternative-fuelled market across all ship types in 2025, accounting for 188 orders and representing 31 percent of total GT. Methanol orders fell to 61 from 149 in 2024, while ammonia and LPG saw only limited order uptake.

LPG and Ethane tanker orders fell by 73 percent from 2024 to 2025. Similarly, bulk carriers, crude oil tankers, and oil/chemical tankers all saw pronounced year-over-year declines, reflecting a continued focus on cost efficiency and fewer immediate incentives for owners to commit to alternative fuels. Car carrier orders paused sharply after several years of strong activity, declining by 90 percent compared to the previous year.

Jason Stefanatos, Global Decarbonization Director at DNV, said: “The resilience of the alternative fuels orderbook in 2025 is mainly driven by cargo owners who have set their own emissions reduction goals despite market slow-down and regulatory uncertainty. We see them prioritizing investments where there is a strong alignment between fuel infrastructure, regulatory certainty, and commercial viability, particularly in container shipping, where LNG and methanol are supported by established supply chains and customer demand.

“In contrast, segments like bulk and tanker are more sensitive to market cycles and capital costs, leading to a preference for conventional fuels until further clarity emerges on fuel lifecycle emissions and regulatory incentives. Practically, this environment should encourage owners to focus on scalable solutions, invest in fuel flexibility, and adopt targeted energy efficiency measures that can be adapted as policy and market conditions evolve.”

Investment in fuel infrastructure continued at pace with 22 LNG bunker vessels added to the orderbook alongside new bunkering vessels capable of supplying methanol and biofuel. These developments signal growing confidence in LNG supply chains and emerging multi-fuel capabilities, reducing operational risk and supporting the economics of alternative fuel adoption.

Wind-assisted propulsion systems (WAPS) saw 24 ships delivered in 2025, with a total of 63 sails installed, slightly up from 2024, which saw 22 deliveries and a total of 49 sails installed.

The pioneering creation is a major turning point in the transition to green shipping and in cutting the carbon emissions in the country's rivers and lakes. The module under which the vessel was created is the national Green Hydrogen Mission. With the use of an advanced hydrogen fuel cell technology, the vessel can generate the required power through a friendly electrochemical reaction, and only water is produced as a byproduct. The event is a testament to India's determination towards self-reliance (Atmanirbhar Bharat) in clean energy innovation.

Market Statics

The Maritime India Vision 2030 includes over 150 projects with expected investments of Rs 3–3.5 lakh crore, having an earlier shipbuilding package of Rs 69,725 crore.

Maritime routes represent about 95% of India's trade by volume and roughly 70% by value, underlining the industry's significance to the nation's financial system and competitiveness.

Major seaports handled about 855 million tonnes of cargo in FY 2024–2025, indicating strong development in maritime trade and port efficiency.

India introduced a massive Rs 1.85 lakh crore NTPC Green Hydrogen Hub project, aiming to produce 5 million metric tonnes (MMT) of green hydrogen annually by 2030, which would account for about 10% of the global market.

Incentives unveiled by the government, such as incentives of Rs 4,440 crore [USD 535 million] with 15 enterprises, have been granted a combined manufacturing capacity of 3,000MW annually under the electrolyser manufacturing incentive plan.

India's clean energy ecosystem by offering up to Rs 5 crore in funding support for green hydrogen R&D start-ups, out of a total of Rs 100 crore.

What is meant by a Hydrogen fuel cell?

A hydrogen fuel cell is a device that generates electricity as a byproduct of the conversion process of oxygen and hydrogen into water. This device is what prevents the battery from running out, as it continually pumps chemicals into the cell. It is frequently utilised in automobiles, power plants, and backup energy sources as a clean, effective substitute for combustion-based energy systems. Hydrogen fuel cells present a spectrum of benefits, including the fact that they emit absolutely no carbon emissions, as the only byproduct is water vapour. They function silently, having fewer moving parts than combustion engines, and are highly scalable, able to power everything from small gadgets to large power stations. Apart from that, they also contribute to energy security since hydrogen can be generated from various sources like water electrolysis, biomass, fossil fuels, and renewable energy.

Why does this type of vessel need to be in the shipping industry?

India has locally developed and launched its first hydrogen fuel cell passenger vessel in Varanasi to promote green inland water transport, lower carbon emissions, and contribute to the net-zero targets by 2070. This zero-emission catamaran uses a fuel cell, which is a Low Temperature Proton Exchange Membrane device and emits only water; thus, it is in line with the National Green Hydrogen Mission. Cochin Shipyard Limited and the Inland Waterways Authority of India have developed it using fully domestic technology, which is a fine example of self-reliance, clean mobility scalability, reduction of logistics costs, and India being ranked among the global leaders in hydrogen maritime innovation, thereby facilitating the growth of the blue economy.

Ship Outlook:

India debuts in a new era of clean water transport with its maiden indigenous hydrogen fuel cell passenger vessel. This 24-meter catamaran is tailored for the Ganga River's zero-emission operations in Varanasi. The heart of its propulsion is a Low Temperature Proton Exchange Membrane (LT, PEM) fuel cell system that takes the stored hydrogen and oxygen from air and converts them into electricity, releasing only water vapour as the byproduct. Besides that, the vessel features a hybrid setup that integrates fuel cells, onboard batteries, and solar panels to ensure a steady power supply and improve the overall system efficiency. The vessel is fully air, conditioned and can carry 50 people with comfortable seating. Its service speed is 6.5, 9 knots (12, 20 km/h), and it can run for up to eight hours on a single hydrogen fill from four onboard cylinders. After meeting all safety requirements, the Indian Register of Shipping has certified the ship. It aids the urban transit system with a low draft suitable for shallow waterways, is operated by 10 crew members.

One can attribute this rise to the country's ambitious national policies, a lot of public and private investments, and India's firm commitment to decarbonization. India is planning to be the main hub for the production, consumption, and export of green hydrogen and its derivatives. India has set a landmark example for sustainable transport by introducing its very first indigenously built hydrogen fuel cell vessel in Varanasi. The event, which included the launch ceremony, was overseen by the Union Ministry, and the project is a manifestation of the government's vision to modernise Inland Waterways and promote eco-friendly mobility. In short, the IWAI, along with the Central Government, has been working towards the expansion of the navigational routes, upgradation of terminals, and has also commenced passenger and cargo services to reduce logistics costs and increase accessibility. This environmentally friendly vessel resonates with the national plans, such as Maritime India Vision 2030 and Maritime Amrit Kaal Vision 2047. This project is the first step towards an ocean of hydrogen, fueled ships, thus enabling India to grow its blue economy and still rise as a champion against climate change.

Industrial Growth handshakes:

In September 2025, Oswal Energies announced a Rs 320 crore investment in green hydrogen infrastructure, focusing on production, storage, and transportation, with a 20 MW plant planned in Gujarat. The concept proposes the construction of a 20 MW green hydrogen facility in Gujarat within the next 12 to 15 months.

In July 2023, SFC Energy officially began production of hydrogen fuel cells in India, establishing a new manufacturing facility in New Delhi/Gurgaon in partnership with FC TecNrgy Pvt Ltd. In just six months, the production facility was constructed and turned over in collaboration with its Indian partner, FCTecNrgy.

This demonstrates that biodiesel can reduce not only net CO₂, but also Black Carbon, which is highly significant for the shipping sector’s total climate footprint.
Although biodiesel demonstrates a significant reduction in Black Carbon, current global production of biofuel can only cover a small share of the global fleet’s total energy demand.
Therefore, the Cleanship project continues to analyse data and work towards recommendations on how Black Carbon and other emissions can be effectively reduced in shipping.
This documentation will contribute to the international efforts to reduce Black Carbon emissions – especially in Arctic regions, where soot particles have a particularly significant climate impact on ice and the environment.","Danish research and demonstration initiative Project Cleanship on Thursday (15 January) said its new data, collected during real-world sailing, documented significant climate benefits from biofuel for the shipping industry.

The findings have been submitted to the International Maritime Organization (IMO).

Soot particles – also known as Black Carbon – are among the most harmful emissions from shipping, both for the climate, where they contribute to global warming and melting of Arctic ice, and for public health through poor air quality. Now, experts from the CLEANSHIP project document that using biodiesel, specifically B100 FAME, during normal operation can reduce Black Carbon emissions by up to 81% compared to traditional marine gas oil (MGO).

The measurements were carried out on the Uni-Tankers A/S ers vessel Falstria Swan, where an advanced online Black Carbon sensor from Green Instruments, developed in collaboration with Danish Technological Institute, made it possible to track emissions in detail and in real time during the vessel’s normal operation.

“We expected that biofuel would lead to cleaner combustion, but the magnitude of the reduction – especially at lower engine loads – is a very positive surprise. This demonstrates that biodiesel can reduce not only net CO₂, but also Black Carbon, which is highly significant for the shipping sector’s total climate footprint. At the same time, the measurement technology allows us to monitor emissions with much greater detail than ever before,” says Simon Martin Spangenberg Bastrup berg, consultant and measurement specialist in alternative fuels and emission reduction at Danish Technological Institute.

For Uni-Tankers, the measurements translate directly into new, practical knowledge:

“The latest real-world sailing data on biodiesel (B100) give us a clear picture of both the black carbon footprint and actual CO₂ emissions. This insight is crucial for achieving our own reduction targets, while also contributing to better, data-driven recommendations for reducing emissions across the shipping industry,” said Troels Reppien en, Technical Director at Uni-Tankers A/S .

Although biodiesel demonstrates a significant reduction in Black Carbon, current global production of biofuel can only cover a small share of the global fleet’s total energy demand. Therefore, the Cleanship project continues to analyse data and work towards recommendations on how Black Carbon and other emissions can be effectively reduced in shipping.

The results from the measurement campaign have now been submitted to the International Maritime Organization (IMO) in the form of a white paper. This documentation will contribute to the international efforts to reduce Black Carbon emissions – especially in Arctic regions, where soot particles have a particularly significant climate impact on ice and the environment.

The white paper is scheduled for consideration at IMO’s 13th session of the Sub-Committee on Pollution Prevention and Response (PPR), which will take place from 9 to 13 February 2026.

Brazilian state-controlled oil and gas producer Petrobras on Thursday (15 January) said it has entered into an agreement to supply bunker fuel with renewable content (VLS B24) to Norwegian chemical tanker operator Odfjell.

Petrobras’ VLS B24 is a VLSFO (Very Low Sulfur Fuel Oil) composed of 24% biodiesel and 76% mineral oil produced at the company’s refineries. The product complies with international quality standards and holds the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification – EU (ISCC EU), a global system that ensures traceability, compliance with sustainability criteria, and the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions throughout the biofuel production chain, specifically designed to meet the requirements of the European market.

In addition, the fuel meets the requirements of FuelEU Maritime, a European Union regulation that mandates a progressive reduction in the GHG intensity of fuels used by ships calling at European ports, encouraging the use of renewable and low-carbon solutions.

“The commercialisation of VLS B24 with a company that has a strong international presence demonstrates Petrobras’ consistent progress toward a low-carbon market, in synergy with our 2026–2030 Business Plan. The initiative not only generates value for the business, but also enables concrete solutions in new energies and decarbonisation, reinforcing our commitment to sustainability and innovation,” said Petrobras’ Director of Logistics, Marketing and Markets, Claudio Schlosser.

Supply will be carried out by dedicated barges from the Rio Grande Terminal (TERIG), where the product blending will also take place. The contract provides for the delivery of up to 12,000 metric tonnes (mt) throughout 2026.

The relationship between Petrobras and Odfjell, marked by a history of collaboration, gained new momentum with the joint initiative of the Brazilian and Norwegian governments to promote sustainable solutions in the energy sector.

“This movement resulted in the creation of a green corridor between the two countries, formalized through a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed in February 2025, which encourages the circulation of vessels powered by low-carbon fuels,” Petrobras added.

Naturgy and Enagás —through its subsidiary Scale Green Energy— on Thursday (15 January) said they have reached an agreement to promote the decarbonisation of maritime transport in the Iberian Peninsula by building and chartering the state-of-the-art vessel Mistral LNG for the supply of liquefied natural gas (LNG) and BioLNG to all types of vessels.

The vessel will have a cargo capacity of 18,900 m³. Scale Green Energy, which began construction in early 2026, will operate the vessel, which will be chartered by Naturgy in 2028 under a long-term contract.

The Mistral LNG will operate, as its main market, in the Iberian Peninsula, which is being reinforced as a strategic hub in southern Europe for bunkering or supply of sustainable fuels, as well as in the area of ​​the Strait of Gibraltar and the Canary Islands, among other destinations in the Atlantic.

The ship will have a length of 138.8 meters, a dual-fuel engine, a service speed of 13 knots, and a range exceeding 4,500 nautical miles. Designed to supply LNG and bioLNG fuel, the vessel will be equipped with advanced technology to minimise emissions and optimise efficiency.

With this initiative, Naturgy positions itself as a strategic operator in the Iberian LNG and bioLNG bunkering market , which is projected to experience exponential growth in the coming years, and advances its commitment to driving the energy transition by offering competitive solutions to its customers. The company has extensive expertise in the energy supply sector and plays a key role in supplying Spain as the country’s main importer of natural gas.

For its part, Enagás—through its subsidiary Scale Green Energy—is consolidating its position as a major player in LNG bunkering in Southern Europe by adding this new vessel to its existing fleet of three ships: Levante LNG, Alisios LNG, and Haugesund Knutsen.

This contributes to the European strategy for reducing emissions in maritime transport and has a driving effect on LNG plants in Spain. All seven Spanish regasification plants are already equipped to supply LNG for bunkering, and those in Barcelona, ​​Cartagena, Huelva, and Gijón have already begun supplying BioLNG to ships and tankers.

This project will help meet the growing demand for alternative fuels in maritime transport and comply with new European regulations requiring a progressive reduction in emissions from marine fuels. In 2024, orders for LNG and bioLNG-powered vessels doubled compared to 2023, and LNG bunkering demand is expected to continue increasing steadily in the Iberian Peninsula in the coming years.

The BioLNG service, which has no associated emissions, uses the interconnected infrastructure from the regasification plants, so that the biomethane injected into the gas network is recognized as BioLNG —a liquid biofuel obtained by processing domestic and industrial organic waste—.

As per the MoU signed, the trio seeks to facilitate the adoption of low-carbon ammonia as a marine fuel, TFG Marine said in a statement on its website on Thursday.

The agreement builds on the existing cooperation between CF Industries and Trafigura in the shipment of low-carbon ammonia, setting out a framework for collaboration on market development, stakeholder engagement, and bunkering logistics planning.

CF Industries will leverage its low-carbon ammonia production and export capabilities at its Donaldsonville, Louisiana, complex. Trafigura will contribute its expertise in commodity logistics and market development.

TFG Marine, which is majority-owned by Trafigura, will facilitate and support the bunkering of the fuel, coordinate ammonia bunkering demand, and transport ammonia to bunkering hubs globally.

Greece, one of the world’s leading shipping nations, took a cautious stance on the proposed International Maritime Organization (IMO) carbon tax.","The European Commission has called for EU to stay united as some of its member states joined a US-led alliance opposed to a net-zero agreement.

Greece is joining Saudi Arabia and the US in negotiations within the International Maritime Organisation (IMO). Last week the Greek minister of environment and energy Stavros Papastavrou met with his Saudi Arabia counterpart, prince Abdulaziz bin Salman Al Saud, at the conclusion of his visit to Riyadh.

The discussion referred to the cooperation between Greece, the United States, and Saudi Arabia within the framework of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and the common position regarding the Net-Zero Framework (NZF) in shipping, which has already borne fruit.

Greece and Saudi Arabia have agreed to cooperate through their respective ministries – shipping and energy – towards submitting a joint proposal on this issue, before the expiry of the new deadline for the adoption of the relevant framework.

It is recalled that last October the IMO decided to postpone the decision to adopt the NZF for one year.

For his part, Mr. Papastavrou emphasized that Greece is “a voice of realism in Europe, when it comes to energy.”

The pushback from certain member states has cast doubt on whether the framework can gain the support needed to move forward, leaving the global shipping sector watching closely.

On Friday, a European Commission spokesperson was asked about the Greek government’s decision to break from the EU line on the IMO’s Net-Zero Framework and instead submit a joint proposal together with Saudi Arabia.

“We continue to stand firmly behind the shared objective of putting global shipping on the net-zero emission path towards 2050,” a European Commission spokesperson said on Friday, January 16.

“We are obviously ready to build bridges and to work with other partners to enable the adoption -when the discussion resumes at the International Maritime Organization Marine Environmental Protection Committee, and it’s very important that all EU Member States stay united in our shared International Maritime Organization goals,” the official added. “So to that end, we are looking into the news, and we are in contact with all the Member States and with the relevant authorities.”

A fierce Trump administration push to stop the global shipping industry from paying for its own climate pollution appeared to have been successful, as efforts to approve the “world’s first global carbon tax” collapsed.

It had been widely assumed the tax would be adopted in October 2025 during the extraordinary session of the Marine Environment Protection Committee in London at the International Maritime Organization.

But after four days of tough negotiations, countries agreed to delay a vote on whether to approve it by 12 months. The delay follows pressure and procedural tactics from the United States and other countries, pushing the adoption vote to October 2026.

The US president Donald Trump voiced its stance against the first of its kind global carbon tax, warning IMO member states to vote against the organization’s Net-Zero Framework aimed at reducing global greenhouse gas emissions from the international shipping sector.

The United States threatened to use visa restrictions, commercial penalties, additional port fees on ships owned, operated, or flagged by countries supporting the framework and sanctions on officials to retaliate against nations that back IMO’s proposed carbon tax. The envisaged measures included potentially blocking vessels registered in those countries from U.S. ports.

Greece, one of the world’s leading shipping nations, took a cautious stance on the proposed International Maritime Organization (IMO) carbon tax.

In this context, the Greek minister of maritime affairs and insular policy, Vasilis Kikilias, in an official statement, underlined that “shipping needs international, fair and realistic rules, accepted by all member states, and not punitive mechanisms that will endanger the stability of global trade.”

The minister emphasized that “we agree on the framework, but we want realism. LNG has proven its reliability and must be utilized as a transitional fuel. We still do not have zero or near-zero emission fuels, not even to approach the reduction targets of the coming decade. The cost of the transition is very high, and a significant part of it must return to the shipping industry and the corresponding infrastructures.”

Some Greek shipowners, big names in the world shipping, long regarded as the industry’s traditionalists, publicly denounced the framework, calling it “unrealistic” and “detached from the commercial realities of global trade.”

While Greek shipowners are investing in cleaner technologies, they remain wary of regulatory measures that could disrupt business models.

The Union of Greek Shipowners see the delay to reach an agreement on its Net-Zero Framework and the postponement of the decision as a “new opportunity to shape a sustainable and effective international framework that will guide global shipping safely and realistically through the green transition.”

Athens, while acknowledging the agreement’s flaws, it says “is ready to lead constructively, with evidence-based and unifying proposals, in a global effort to shape a fair, practical and enforceable clean plan, where all stakeholders assume their share of responsibility on the collective path toward the green transition.”

“The lack of consensus highlighted deep rifts over the proposed Net-Zero Framework regulation, where the positions advanced by the shipping industry were not sufficiently taken into account,” the Union of Greek Shipowners said in its statement.

On the other hand, the delay on the adoption of the Net-Zero Framework, is characterized by environmental groups as a “major setback” for global efforts to clean up shipping industry emissions.

As they say, governments will now have to spend the next months rallying every nation that supports the framework, and convincing those who are on the fence, or opposing, that its adoption is the “only sane way forward.”

Industry bodies were equally alarmed. In a joint statement, seven associations – Japanese Shipowners’ Association, Royal Belgian Shipowners’ Association, Royal Association of Netherlands Shipowners, Singapore Shipping Association, UK Chamber of Shipping, Norwegian Shipowners’ Association, and Danish Shipping – warned that failure to adopt the NZF would leave the industry facing a complicated and inefficient patchwork of national and regional regulatory frameworks.

“Binding global regulation is essential for achieving the goal of climate neutral shipping in 2050. We need global regulation and a level playing field. The alternative to the Net-Zero Framework is not zero regulation, as some of the opponents of the agreement may wish for, but rather a complicated patchwork of regional and national regulations, which is entirely the wrong answer for a global industry,” said Anne H. Steffensen, CEO of the trade and employers’ organisation Danish Shipping.

The International Chamber of Shipping (ICS) and European Shipowners (ES | ECSA) also issued, among other leading associations and organizations, declarations of support for the Net-Zero Framework.",https://shippingtelegraph.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/SHIPS-GREECE-1024x536.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 21:56:23.572398
