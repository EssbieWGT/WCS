Based on comparisons between the efficiency of WinGD’s established diesel engines and similar dual-fuel designs, the high-pressure dual-fuel concept is anticipated to deliver improved efficiency.
“Large container vessels present a unique propulsion challenge,” said Benny Hilström, Vice President, Market Development at WinGD.
“Building on our long-standing diesel engine expertise and our deep experience in LNG dual-fuel technology, we’ve developed the X‑DF‑HP.
“For ultra-large container vessels choosing LNG as their pathway to net zero, the X-DF-HP is the most cost-effective option,” added Hilström.","Swiss marine power company WinGD has introduced its first high-pressure LNG dual-fuel engine, the X-DF-HP, developed specifically for the demanding operating profiles of ultra-large container vessels .

Unveiled at Marintec China 2025, the new engine arrives at a pivotal moment for shipowners navigating the energy transition, with the IMO’s Net Zero Framework currently paused and the prospect of regional regulation becoming increasingly fragmented. As a result, interest in LNG-fuelled tonnage continues to accelerate.

Available in X82 and X92 bore sizes, the X-DF-HP is tailored to the scale, speed and load requirements of the ULCV sector, with first deliveries planned for 2028. Based on comparisons between the efficiency of WinGD’s established diesel engines and similar dual-fuel designs, the high-pressure dual-fuel concept is anticipated to deliver improved efficiency.

“Large container vessels present a unique propulsion challenge,” said Benny Hilström, Vice President, Market Development at WinGD. “They demand immense power, exceptional efficiency and long-term fuel flexibility. With the X-DF-HP, we are providing operators with a purpose-built solution for the most power-hungry vessels, offering uncompromised, trouble-free propulsion.”

Available with the same auxiliary system requirements—such as fuel supply pressure—as other recognised engine concepts, it supports straightforward installation for shipyards and provides a practical, future-ready option for vessel owners. Achieving Tier III compliance in both gas and diesel modes using only a standard SCR, X-DF-HP offers operators a powerful, space-efficient and future-ready choice for the most demanding ultra-large container vessels.

“The X-DF-HP is built on the high-pressure Diesel X92-B engine platform that has already proven itself as one of the most efficient and reliable large-bore solutions in the container segment,” said Sebastian Hensel, Vice President R&D at WinGD. “Building on our long-standing diesel engine expertise and our deep experience in LNG dual-fuel technology, we’ve developed the X‑DF‑HP. Our tests and simulations show the X-DF-HP will deliver a clear step up in fuel efficiency and GHG performance compared to existing high-pressure dual-fuel engines on the market.”

The X-DF-HP builds on more than a century of high-pressure Diesel cycle expertise and dual-fuel innovation at WinGD. It joins the company’s high-pressure, multi-fuel portfolio, which includes the methanol/ethanol-capable X-DF-M/E and ammonia-fuelled X-DF-A engines. This provides operators with a fully fuel-flexible platform, with established engines such as the X92-B now able to be retrofitted for high-pressure LNG, methanol, ethanol, or ammonia as fuel pathways evolve.

With LNG providing FuelEU Maritime compliance well into the next decade, and uncertainty remaining around future IMO requirements, LNG continues to offer a cost-competitive, low-risk route to fleet decarbonisation. WinGD’s X-DF (low pressure) and X-DF-HP engines are fully compatible with renewable methane blends, enabling operators to progress towards lower-carbon operations without extensive mechanical modifications or the high retrofitting costs typically associated with emerging fuels.

“For ultra-large container vessels choosing LNG as their pathway to net zero, the X-DF-HP is the most cost-effective option,” added Hilström. “For all other vessels, the low-pressure X-DF platform continues to deliver the best lifecycle economics. Together, these propulsion options give vessel owners and operators complete confidence in selecting LNG—and WinGD—for the energy transition of their fleets.”",https://cyprusshippingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/WinGD-unveils-high-pressure-dual-fuel-LNG-engine-expanding-its-optimised-propulsion-portfolio.jpg,N,,2025-12-03 22:56:50.371448

These agreements are expected to bolster Oman’s logistics competitiveness and support its goals for decarbonization.

The first MoU was established with the Republic of Türkiye on November 24, focusing on collaboration in transport, international transport corridors, communications, and information technology. This agreement was negotiated at a ministerial level between Oman’s Minister of Transport, Eng Said bin Hamoud al Maawali, and Türkiye’s Abdulkadir Uraloğlu. It signifies a strengthening of bilateral relations, which have already seen developments this year, including the formation of an Omani-Turkish coordinating council and reciprocal visa facilitation measures. These steps are set to enhance the flow of people and goods between the two nations, while also enabling Omani ports to potentially improve their transit volumes to Mediterranean and European markets via new transport corridors.

In a complementary move, Oman also signed an MoU with the Republic of the Philippines to mutually recognize seafarers’ certificates. This essential agreement, signed by Eng Khamis bin Mohammed al Shammakhi of Oman and Sonia B Malaluan from the Philippines’ Maritime Industry Authority, is aimed at simplifying crew certification processes, promoting labor mobility, and reducing administrative challenges for ship operators employing diverse crews. The initiative is particularly impactful for Oman’s shipping and offshore sectors, as it expands access to a recognized pool of seafarers, helping to lower crewing costs and alleviate manpower shortages for regional shipping lines.

Oman’s delegation at the IMO also pursued broader partnerships, including discussions in London with Austria’s embassy focused on sustainable maritime development and green energy initiatives. These talks reflect a dual approach: enhancing Oman’s logistics assets while adhering to international environmental and safety standards, which are critical in today’s chartering and financing contexts.

Oman’s proactive engagement at the IMO sessions and participation in the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) indicates a strategy aimed at aligning economic growth with sustainability. By adopting measures such as the Net-Zero Framework set by the IMO, Oman is positioning its ports and logistics groups, like Asyad and SOHAR Port and Freezone, to become competitive in green shipping and related financing sectors.",https://maritimefairtrade.org/wp-content/uploads/pwa/icon-192.png,N,,2025-12-03 19:56:10.506239

During an interview at the Singapore Maritime Week on April 19, he stated that the sector is on track to finalize a comprehensive strategy by next year to meet targets aimed at net-zero emissions by 2050. This plan marks a significant update from 2018, which encouraged a 50% reduction in emissions but lacked firm interim targets for 2030 and 2040.

The revised strategy, announced in 2023, outlines measures intended for approval by 2025, with implementation slated for 2027. Net-zero emissions imply a balance where greenhouse gas emissions are equivalent to those being removed from the atmosphere. To assist in achieving these objectives, the IMO is collaborating with external consultants to analyze various scenarios and assess stakeholder concerns. Additionally, the organization is developing a technical and financial framework to facilitate the transition.

The IMO, a specialized agency of the United Nations with 176 member states, oversees the safety, security, and environmental performance of international shipping. Notably, the interest in cleaner marine fuels, such as methanol, is rising as part of the emissions reduction strategy. The demand for methanol-powered ships has surged, with 138 orders placed in 2023 compared to only 35 the previous year. Among these orders was a significant acquisition by the Singapore-based Ocean Network Express, which is set to receive 12 methanol dual-fuel ships by 2027.

Aligned with these initiatives, Singapore is advancing its maritime sector’s transition by establishing a maritime energy training facility designed to equip approximately 10,000 seafarers and maritime personnel with the skills needed for using cleaner fuels. This facility is expected to be operational by 2026. Singapore’s port terminals aim to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, as outlined in the Maritime Singapore Decarbonisation Blueprint launched in 2022. The strategy includes progressive reductions in domestic harbour craft emissions through alternative energy solutions, including blended biofuels and electric propulsion systems.",https://maritimefairtrade.org/wp-content/uploads/pwa/icon-192.png,N,,2025-12-03 19:56:15.794049

Core Power sees potential in US-Europe and US-Asia routes as the likely first contenders for this type of ship.","The use of nuclear reactors in shipping has the potential to appeal to bridge the widening divide between supporters and skeptics on decarbonisation, according to technology firm Core Power.

Over the past seven years Core Power has been developing the use of nuclear reactors in commercial shipping, at first as floating power plants and subsequently for nuclear-powered propulsion, and the firm hopes to see its first orders before the end of this decade.

The technology can appeal both to those disappointed and encouraged by the IMO's recent decision to delay a vote on its net-zero framework by being both a means of decarbonisation and a means of improving on current technologies, Mikal Bøe, CEO of Core Power, said at a press briefing event last week.

""We're starting to see this sort of entrenchment of two camps, almost like left and right in politics, where net zero says we've got to save the planet, and we've got to impact the way we do things to do so, and the other side says, actually the planet is going to be fine,"" he said.

""I see nuclear emerging in the gap, because it's the only thing that solves both; one that says, here is a way of not emitting anything and using a lot less resources to generate a lot more effect, and then on the other side, which is the anti-net-zero camp, we can say we're getting double or triple the generating capacity.""

Earlier this year the firm hired Charlotte Vere, a former UK maritime minister and member of the House of Lords, as vice president for international relations.

""Whether you're in the UK or the US, the focus on nuclear is huge, and it's bipartisan,"" Vere said at the event.

""It's not a question of one side of politics or the other wanting to take forward the opportunities that we see in nuclear.

""Just look what's happening in the US; President Trump, like him or loathe him, is absolutely focused on it, because he sees it as a way of projecting American energy dominance throughout the world.""

IMO Delay

The company has not yet seen signs of the IMO NZF delay dampening enthusiasm for nuclear reactors in shipping.

""I was a bit worried about that; when this first happened, I was on a business trip going around speaking to a lot of shareholders and some new companies as well, a bit nervous about what they were going to say,"" Bøe told Ship & Bunker at the event.

""Are they going to say, 'Great, now we doing have to do anything, we can just carry on as usual'?""

""The reaction I got was different, it was one that said, 'Phew, thankfully now we don't have to go down this route; we can focus on what's important, and we can now focus on the things that give us a competitive advantage, the things that help us create a better industry.'""

Order Expectations

The firm has previously said it expects to receive its first reactor orders for ships by the end of the 2020s.

The first of these reactors is likely to be installed on a ship by 2033, Bøe said last week.

""The first installation that we've now got being designed is due for 2033, and then there's a lot of trialling and testing and validation et cetera,"" he said.

""And then that orderbook starts to build, so we assume that the first orderbook that comes form that will be in the region of 15 to 20 ships, which will then be constructed between 2034-5 to the end of that decade, and then it starts to accelerate from there.

""We see an opportunity to get to the 3,000 ship mark up to about 2060.

""It's not about meeting a 2030 target, it's about creating a product that demonstrates how you can really make a big difference in both shipping and power generation.""

Costs

The company puts the up-front capital cost of a large ship with nuclear propulsion at about $700 million.

But because the reactors on these vessels will come loaded with enough fuel to run for at least the 25-year commercial life of this ship, this cost needs to be compared to the cost of buying a new conventionally-fuelled ship and all of the bunker fuel it will consume over its lifetime.

Using this calculation, nuclear propulsion could be competitive at bunker prices not far off today's level, Bøe said.

""All the models are pointing to being a competitor with bunkers at about $600/mt,"" he said.

The VLSFO price has averaged at about $585.50/mt at 20 leading hubs around the world this year, according to Ship & Bunker's G20-VLSFO Index.

Core Power's calculation does not include other savings and revenues that a ship with nuclear propulsion could generate, including EU or other GHG costs, and the potential to sell excess power supply to ports while at berth.

Another factor not included is the higher speeds at which these vessels could operate, meaning they can carry more cargo per year, as a ship with nuclear propulsion would not need to limit its speed to optimise bunker consumption and cut emissions.

""We should be designing ships that could do - for bulkers and tankers - 17, 18, 19 knots, and we should be designing container ships that should do north of 30 knots,"" Bøe said.

""It creates an efficiency in the industry that makes it more competitive.""

Where Might Ships With Nuclear Propulsion Operate?

The issue of where the first ships with nuclear propulsion might operate is a complex one.

Nuclear regulators in the state where the ship is flagged will put controls on where the ship can operate, and not every country is likely immediately to accept the arrival of ships with nuclear reactors at its ports.

Core Power sees potential in US-Europe and US-Asia routes as the likely first contenders for this type of ship.

""It's going to be Transatlantic or Transpacific,"" Bøe said.

""My bet is a sort of troika or quadrangle of South Korea, Japan, Canada, United States in the Pacific, with Australia appended to it because of the submarine deal that the Australians have done with the US and UK.

""And then I think in the Atlantic, it's the mogas trade - the faster movement of the mogas arbitrage in the Atlantic - which is basically LRs and MRs, and then container ships.""",https://shipandbunker.cdn.speedyrails.net/a/img/_mt_2f47860819d0f2f3071d34b84522b192.jpg,N,,2025-12-03 10:57:33.593351

Wärtsilä Marine in brief Wärtsilä Marine is a global pioneer in power, propulsion and lifecycle solutions for the marine market.","As the maritime industry prepares to enter 2026, technology group Wärtsilä has identified four important trends that will affect global shipping in 2026. From the rise of digitalisation and big data to the growing importance of flexible decarbonisation strategies, these trends are set to redefine competitiveness, efficiency, and sustainability for vessel owners and operators worldwide:

Lifecycle optimisation: With rapid technological advances and evolving regulations, vessel owners are shifting from short-term fixes to holistic, long-term strategies. Lifecycle optimisation considers environmental impact, operational efficiency, and economic viability from vessel design through to end-of-life, supporting smarter investment decisions and asset value preservation. Collaboration and transparency between owners, operators, and OEMs are key to maximising benefits and navigating future uncertainties.

Flexible decarbonisation strategies: Decarbonisation approaches must be tailored to each vessel’s operational profile, available fuels, and business priorities. A flexible strategy - encompassing planning, integration, and continuous monitoring - ensures vessels remain competitive and compliant as technology and regulations evolve. Investments in fuel-flexible engines, hybrid propulsion, and methane slip mitigation are among the solutions enabling owners to future-proof their fleets.

Digitalisation, big data, and analytics: The increasing complexity of vessels - featuring hybrid setups, advanced power management, and alternative fuel systems - demands robust digital integration. Harnessing onboard data through advanced analytics enables real-time operational recommendations, driving significant reductions in fuel consumption, emissions, and operational costs. While some industry leaders are already leveraging these capabilities, widespread adoption is still hindered by challenges such as data governance and integration, but the path forward is clear.

Less predictable regulations: Despite the recent delay in the IMO’s Net-Zero Framework, the regulatory landscape continues to evolve, with regional initiatives like the EU Emission Trading System and FuelEU Maritime impacting a significant portion of global shipping. As businesses prepare for stricter emissions requirements, robust compliance and reporting protocols are becoming essential.

This is supported by over 450 methanol-capable vessels in operation and on order and technical solutions now available for all major ship types.
But, as with all alternative fuels, methanol’s future role will depend on a combination of regulatory, economic, and operational factors.

This is supported by over 450 methanol-capable vessels in operation and on order and technical solutions now available for all major ship types.

DNV’s latest white paper, “Methanol fuel in shipping,” highlights that methanol-fuelled engines and technical systems have reached high readiness levels, and that existing global production sites, storage facilities, and a growing bunker fleet are providing a strong platform for wider adoption. In addition, industry stakeholders are already investing in the fuel, with China accounting for 43 percent of planned global low-GHG methanol production capacity. But, as with all alternative fuels, methanol’s future role will depend on a combination of regulatory, economic, and operational factors.

Knut Ørbeck-Nilssen, CEO Maritime at DNV said: “As the maritime industry explores pathways to a lower-carbon future, it is important to consider a range of practical and scalable solutions. There is no one-size-fits-all answer, and different shipping segments and geographies will require different approaches. Methanol is one option that draws on established technologies and infrastructure, and it is encouraging to see the industry’s growing interest in a variety of alternative fuels.”

Methanol can offer environmental benefits. It is sulfur-free, produces negligible soot, and emits significantly less NOx than fuel oil. The report highlights that certain bio- and e-methanol pathways can deliver very low or even negative lifecycle emissions, and that methanol’s compatibility with existing port infrastructure and the availability of interim bunkering solutions may also reduce complexity and cost for shipowners.

However, the report notes that cost and availability remain significant barriers, as is the case for many alternative fuels. Bio-methanol prices in 2025 average around USD 2,500 per tonne MGOe, roughly three times the cost of marine gas oil, while global production stands at just 2.2 million tonnes, far below the potential demand of up to 60 million tonnes by 2040. The report models four demand scenarios, showing that regulatory frameworks such as the IMO’s Net Zero Framework and FuelEU Maritime could be decisive in scaling up adoption.

Marius Leisner, Senior Principal Consultant in DNV added: “From a technical perspective, methanol-fuelled engines have demonstrated high reliability, with industry data indicating that modern dual-fuel engine designs have accumulated more than 600,000 operating hours on methanol. Retrofit feasibility is well established, and the use of conventional bunkering systems, unlike cryogenic fuels, means ports can adapt quickly and cost-effectively.",,N,,2025-12-03 07:56:33.002255

It’s a big reduction, largely in line with the change in regulations. It will undoubtedly improve air quality in regions close to shipping, although the reduction in sulfur might have an unintended global cooling effect due to the change in ship plumes interacting with clouds

Upon completion, the project will set a benchmark for advanced liquid ammonia carriers domestically and globally, offering a replicable and scalable ""China Solution"" for the green development of the shipping industry.","Recently, China's first domestically built 41,000 m³ ammonia-dual-fuel LPG/liquid ammonia carrier, independently developed and designed by Shanghai Merchant Ship Design and Research Institute (SDARI) under China State Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC) for Tianjin Xinan Shipping Co., Ltd., officially commenced construction at CSSC Huangpu Wenchong Shipbuilding Company. The launch of this project marks a breakthrough for China in the field of ammonia-fueled powered vessels for medium-sized gas carriers, injecting new momentum into the low-carbon transformation of the shipping industry.

Technical Highlights: Innovative Design Combining Environmental and Economic Advantages

Leading Environmental Friendliness: As China's first medium-sized gas carrier adopting ammonia-dual-fuel power, the vessel is equipped with an internationally advanced ammonia-dual-fuel propulsion system and Sweden's Alfa Laval ammonia fuel supply system (FCM Ammonia), covering key modules such as fuel supply, ammonia release mitigation, and fuel valve control, ensuring the safe and efficient application of ammonia fuel. Its design fully complies with the International Maritime Organization (IMO) Tier III emission standards and the EEDI Phase 3 requirements. Compared to mainstream LNG dual-fuel vessels, the full life cycle carbon emissions can be reduced by 61% in specific scenarios, directly contributing to the achievement of IMO's 2050 ""net-zero emissions"" target.

Outstanding Economic Benefits: The vessel adopts three IMO Type A independent liquid cargo tanks and two deck tanks, with a total tank capacity of approximately 42,000 m³ and a minimum design temperature of -50°C, allowing flexible transportation of various cargoes including LPG and liquid ammonia. In terms of energy-saving design, the vessel features SDARI's characteristic low-wave-added-resistance S-BOW straight bow lines and the energy-saving duct independently developed by its subsidiary, SDARI-ECO. The hull's hydrodynamic performance is significantly improved, operational energy consumption is effectively reduced, achieving a balance between economy and environmental protection.

Industrial Layout: Scaling Up the Development of Green Ships

It is reported that this 41,000 m³ ammonia-dual-fuel carrier is an important part of the series of vessel types developed in cooperation between Tianjin Xinan Shipping and CSSC Huangpu Wenchong. The two parties previously signed construction contracts for three 25,000 m³ and four 41,000 m³ ammonia-dual-fuel LPG/liquid ammonia carriers. The commencement of construction of this first vessel will propel this series into the mass production phase. Among these, the first set of ammonia fuel supply systems is expected to be delivered by the end of 2025, laying the foundation for subsequent vessel construction.

As a major domestic shipyard for building gas carriers, CSSC Huangpu Wenchong currently holds orders for 16 gas carriers, covering several mainstream vessel types such as 60,000 m³, 48,000 m³, and 41,000 m³, achieving a leap in technological self-sufficiency and synergistic advantages in the industry chain within the small and medium-sized gas carrier sector. The commencement of construction of this ammonia-dual-fuel vessel further enriches its new energy vessel portfolio and consolidates its leading position in the field of green shipping equipment.

Industry Significance: Leading the Upgrade of the Low-Carbon Maritime Energy Supply Chain

As the global shipping industry accelerates its transition to low-carbon operations, ammonia, as a key zero-carbon fuel option, has made the R&D and construction of its transportation equipment an industry focus. This 41,000 m³ ammonia-ready dual-fuel carrier boasts excellent adaptability for green ammonia fuel, enabling it to serve the future low-carbon maritime energy supply chain and provide efficient, environmentally friendly transportation solutions for the liquid ammonia trade.

The in-depth collaboration between Tianjin Xinan Shipping and China State Shipbuilding Corporation is not only a critical step for the enterprises' own green transformation but also a significant practice by China's shipbuilding industry in responding to the ""dual carbon"" goals and seizing the high ground in the global green shipping sector.

Meanwhile, EmissionLink’s Managing Director has warned that the IMO’s decision to delay its Net Zero Framework is creating a regulatory vacuum which threatens to fragment global shipping decarbonization efforts.

The IMO Assembly has selected ten states with the largest interest in providing international shipping services to join the IMO Council under category (a), encompassing China, Greece, Italy, Japan, Liberia, Norway, Panama, the Republic of Korea, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and the United States of America.

Ten more states secured a spot in category (b), said to have the largest interest in international seaborne trade, encapsulating Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, India, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and the United Arab Emirates.

The remaining category (C) is made up of 20 states not elected under (a) or (b) segments, which have special interests in maritime transport or navigation and whose election to the Council will ensure the representation of all major geographic areas of the world.

The list of these 20 countries includes the Bahamas, Belgium, Chile, Cyprus, Egypt, Finland, Indonesia, Jamaica, Malaysia, Malta, Mexico, Morocco, Nigeria, Peru, Philippines, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, and Türkiye.

While the newly elected Council will meet for its 136th session on December 4, 2025, and elect its Chair and Vice-Chair for the next biennium, EmissionLink’s Managing Director claims that several countries are already moving to fill the void in the wake of the IMO’s move to postpone its Net Zero Framework.

In light of this, the UK Emissions Trading Scheme (UK ETS) will come into force in June 2026, Türkiye is preparing its own version, and Gabon on Africa’s west coast has openly discussed a local carbon levy, with more governments likely to follow, driven as much by fiscal pressures as environmental goals.

Philippos Ioulianou, Managing Director of EmissionLink, commented: “What looks like a pause is, in reality, an open door for national governments to move ahead with their own systems. Instead of gaining clarity, we risk creating a patchwork of unaligned carbon schemes that will make global compliance significantly harder for shipowners.

“For many governments facing widening budget gaps, carbon pricing offers a quick route to new revenue. Without a unified global framework, carbon markets could become less about decarbonisation and more about balancing the books.

“Good luck to the shipowner who gets it wrong. Picture a vessel calling at a West African port, unaware of a newly introduced local regulation. The port authority could detain it for non-compliance and the owner is left footing the bill.”

Ioulianou warns that regionalized systems will multiply reporting formats, verification rules, and administrative burdens, creating real operational risks, adding that some owners are already adjusting trade patterns to avoid overlapping schemes. He also raised concerns about the way revenues from emerging national carbon schemes would be used.

Ioulianou emphasized: “There is no assurance that these funds will flow back into decarbonisation. Some governments won’t even know how much they’ll collect until year-end and once the money arrives, the temptation to redirect it to other priorities will be strong. Managing this manually, port by port or across scattered spreadsheets, is no longer realistic.

“Owners need real-time intelligence on regulatory changes and data they can act on — long before they reach the next port of call. […] Every new national scheme makes it harder for the IMO to rebuild a globally aligned approach later. Once rules fracture into regional pieces, putting them back together will be extremely difficult.

“The delay was meant to give the industry time to adapt. Instead, it risks creating confusion, competition and complacency. The world isn’t waiting for a decision, it’s moving ahead, one emissions scheme at a time.”",https://decarbonfuse.com/assets/favi/favicon-32x32-b1c94ae87840c662751403aefa5b6ea92417e97aab4cbce5a1b99c4e112cac36.png,N,,2025-12-03 13:58:07.581817

During this year’s London International Shipping Week, ABS chairman and chief executive Christopher Wiernicki urged the maritime industry to approach innovation through a single guiding question: “Does it make us safer?”

That principle has driven one of the classification society’s latest technical advances: the enhancement of its containership lashing system notation, CLP-V(PARR), to incorporate a seasonality factor. The addition gives boxship operators greater operational flexibility by accounting for variable sea conditions throughout the year.

Safety is just one part of a broader vision. Wiernicki has also called on the maritime sector to seize what he described as a “once-in-a-generation opportunity”: harnessing nuclear power for commercial shipping.

That call is already being backed by action. Two pioneering nuclear projects received Approval in Principle (AiP) from ABS in 2025. The first, developed by South Korea’s HD Korea Shipbuilding & Offshore Engineering, is a 15,000 teu containership concept powered by a molten salt reactor providing heat, paired with a supercritical carbon dioxide system for power generation.

The second project envisions a floating nuclear power barge capable of supporting port facilities or coastal communities from offshore. Expanding this vision even further, ABS has also published a landmark study on floating nuclear power data centres, proposing designs that could help meet surging energy demands from artificial intelligence and cloud computing.

Beyond nuclear, ABS continues to explore a range of alternative fuel paths. In partnership with the European Maritime Safety Agency, it led two studies examining the potential of synthetic fuels such as e-diesel, e-methane and e-methanol.

To support industry adoption, ABS has also released two key advisories: Dual-Fuel Solutions for Newbuild Vessels, a comprehensive review of dual-fuel propulsion options pairing traditional hydrocarbons with liquefied natural gas, methanol or ammonia; and Safety Insights for Ammonia as a Marine Fuel, which explores ammonia’s onboard performance and risk profile.

Addressing the growing risk of electric vehicle battery fires on board vehicle carriers, ABS has developed advanced simulation models of lithium-ion thermal runaway, providing new insight to strengthen firefighting strategies and vessel design.

Wiernicki is set to retire at the end of 2025, after 14 years at the helm of ABS. He will be replaced by president and chief operating officer John McDonald.

02 / Knut Ørbeck-Nilssen, DNV

In DNV’s latest Maritime Forecast to 2050, Knut Ørbeck-Nilssen, chief executive of DNV Maritime, paints a picture of an industry in transformation, driven by regulation, technology and collaboration on an unprecedented scale.

While the heart of the forecast — the International Maritime Organization’s approval of the Net-Zero Framework — ultimately was postponed, DNV continues to call for urgent action to finalise certification frameworks for sustainable fuels.

Equally important is ensuring that early adopters are rewarded, believes DNV. Clear incentive mechanisms for zero and near-zero fuels, as well as for efficiency and carbon-saving technologies, are essential to sustain industry confidence.

According to data from DNV’s Alternative Fuels Insight platform, the number of vessels being delivered with alternative-fuel capabilities is set to more than double by 2028.

By 2030, these ships could consume about 50m tonnes of non-oil fuels annually — a big step toward the IMO’s target of reducing emissions by 20% by the end of the decade.

The report notes that competition for low-emission fuels will be fierce, which will intensify the need for cross-sector coordination and investment in green fuel production.

While the fuel transition will take time, DNV stresses that energy efficiency offers immediate opportunities for impact. Advances in wind-assisted propulsion, digital optimisation and onboard carbon capture prove that multiple solutions can work together to cut emissions.

Research in this year’s report shows that installing carbon capture systems on large containerships, tankers and bulk carriers is technically feasible, with manageable space requirements. If combined with CO2 offloading infrastructure at key ports, such retrofits could reduce global fleet emissions by nearly 9%, noted DNV.

03 / Hayato Suga, ClassNK

The year 2025 was a significant one for ClassNK, as Hayato Suga took over the president and chief executive role at the Japanese class society in March, replacing Hiroaki Sakashita, who became chairman.

Suga brings with him four decades of experience within the organisation and has set a clear vision for ClassNK that include responding to the evolving needs of the shipping industry at a time when environmental imperatives and digitalisation are blurring the boundaries between maritime and other sectors.

His priorities centre on expanding the society’s service portfolio and fostering a culture of initiative-driven innovation across the organisation.

One of the year’s key milestones was the opening of ClassNK’s new Tech Expertise Centre in Piraeus, Greece. The centre is designed to provide comprehensive technical support extending beyond traditional survey activities, reinforcing the society’s presence in one of the world’s leading maritime hubs.

Throughout 2025, ClassNK continued to diversify its activities beyond conventional classification, engaging with emerging technologies, alternative fuels, emissions-based certification and smart ship innovations.

The society also advanced its technically based “endorsement” methodology, enabling certification in advance for new technologies and solutions before their widespread adoption.

In addition, it expanded its analytical and advisory tools, complementing its growing Alternative Fuels Insights report portfolio with the introduction of the ClassNK Fleet Cost Simulation service.

This new tool enables shipowners and operators to evaluate the financial impacts of upcoming regulatory measures, including FuelEU Maritime and the EU Emissions Trading System.

04 / Nick Brown, Lloyd’s Register

Lloyd’s Register marked a milestone year in 2025 by returning to its historic London headquarters at 71 Fenchurch Street, following a comprehensive refurbishment. The reopening ceremony was honoured by a royal visit from Her Royal Highness The Princess Royal, coinciding with London International Shipping Week in September.

Earlier in the year, LR unveiled its newly structured LR Advisory Service, bringing together more than 250 global experts to provide integrated business and technical advisory support.

The service aims to help the maritime sector accelerate progress in decarbonisation, digital transformation, regulatory adaptation and operational performance.

At LISW 2025, LR introduced its Biofuel Advisory Service, offering targeted guidance for shipowners, bunker suppliers and fuel producers navigating the evolving landscape of biofuel adoption.

Reinforcing its leadership in next-generation maritime energy, LR also announced an AI-driven partnership with Microsoft to streamline permitting and licensing processes for maritime nuclear applications — a key contribution to a global cross-industry pledge to triple nuclear energy capacity by 2050.

Across the year, LR delivered transformative milestones in alternative fuels, wind propulsion and antifouling innovation, including the classification of the world’s first wind-assisted aframax tanker.

Under chief executive Nick Brown, LR’s influence continued to grow across major market sectors, highlighted by the launch of its Cruise Ship Centre of Expertise, which integrates classification, advisory and digital services to enhance cruise safety, efficiency and sustainability.

The year also saw the release of the Global Maritime Trends 2025 Barometer, produced jointly with the Lloyd’s Register Foundation. The report provides a data-driven view of the industry’s progress toward digitalisation and decarbonisation, warning that without coordinated international regulation, progress risks fragmentation.

05 / Zhao Yan, China Classification Society

Zhao Yan, who assumed the role of chairman and president of the China Classification Society in April 2025, following the retirement of Sun Feng, is steering the organisation through a transformative year, marked by significant strides in decarbonisation, digitalisation and global expansion.

The CCS is continuing to position itself as a key player in the transition toward a greener, smarter and more connected global shipping industry.

In October, the CCS released its landmark China Sustainable Shipping Fuel Development Report 2025, an analysis of global and domestic greenhouse gas-reduction policies and future trends in sustainable marine fuels.

The report explores pathways for the adoption of green hydrogen, methanol, ammonia and biofuels, aiming to guide policy makers and industry leaders in building a robust low-carbon fuel supply chain.

A technological milestone came in July 2025, when the CCS provided newbuilding class provision for the world’s first methanol dual-fuel, low-speed marine diesel engine for a very large crude carrier.

During the North Bund International Shipping Forum, the society hosted the Digital and Intelligent Forum, underscoring the importance of data-driven technologies and automation in enhancing the industry’s productivity and safety.

To bolster its international service capabilities, the CCS launched the International Ship Business Operation Centre in Shanghai, providing integrated, full-lifecycle services for global clients. The initiative marks a strategic step in expanding the CCS’s reach in the international maritime market.

The CCS further demonstrated its global engagement by participating as an international partner at London International Shipping Week, where it showcased its contributions to global maritime safety, sustainability and innovation.

In another milestone, the Zhoushan Office of CCS oversaw the successful delivery of the world’s largest ultra-low temperature refrigerated cargoships. The 9,000 dwt vessels can maintain temperatures as low as -55°C for the transport of high-value seafood such as tuna.

06 / Matthieu de Tugny, Bureau Veritas

Bureau Veritas’ marine and offshore division continues to help accelerate the industry’s transition toward a sustainable lower-carbon future.

Through its collaboration with shipowners, operators and technology pioneers, BV is enabling the deployment of next-generation technologies designed to cut emissions and reshape the global shipping landscape.

As a thought leader in maritime sustainability, BV president Matthieu de Tugny released his latest book, Towards a Sustainable Blue Economy, in 2025.

The book calls for systemic change in how the maritime industry is funded, fuelled and operated — urging collaboration between financial, regulatory and technical stakeholders to drive pragmatic, collective progress toward net zero emissions.

The classification society has issued several AiPs for cutting-edge projects, including the HavHyS project, advancing liquid hydrogen and ammonia fuel cell technology, in partnership with Malaysian shipowner MISC Group, and supporting the expansion of ammonia bunkering newbuildings in a partnership with Japan’s Sasaki Shipbuilding.

BV has also facilitated the integration of multiple green fuel and wind propulsion solutions across a diverse range of newbuildings, including the sail-powered ro-ro cargoship Neoliner Origin (IMO: 1021829), which entered service in October.

Reflecting its leadership in alternative fuels, BV maintains a 30% market share in LNG bunkering vessels and has classed the world’s first ammonia bunkering vessel, while BV is also the leading class society for methanol bunkering vessels.

BV Asia-Pacific senior vice-president Alex Gregg-Smith will take over the president role of the marine and offshore division in early 2026.

07 / Hyung-chul Lee, Korean Register

The Korean Register of Shipping is actively collaborating with all major shipbuilders on its home turf to advance smart and sustainable ship technologies, focusing on digital transformation, alternative fuels and safety innovation.

They include Smart Accommodation System, which is being developed in a partnership with HD Hyundai Mipo and HD Hyundai Samho, to approve the Internet of Things-based crew accommodation to enhance crew comfort and energy efficiency, while verifying cyber resilience for next-generation newbuildings.

In AI-based solutions, the KR and HD Hyundai Samho signed an MOU in June to co-develop AI-powered tools for ship design optimisation and structural assessment. The project includes an AI-driven hull support arrangement system and a generative AI-based design verification platform, aiming to boost design productivity and security.

Meanwhile, under its chairman and chief executive Hyung-chul Lee, the KR agreed with Hanwha Ocean to jointly develop a 150,000 cu m ultra large ammonia carrier and an LNG carrier with a world first, forward-deckhouse design.

At Gastech 2025, the KR and HD Hyundai Samho announced they are developing a water-circulated, double-wall ammonia fuel pipe system to prevent leakage and enhance safety on ammonia-fuelled ships, with plans to propose related safety standards to the IMO.

The KR has formed a joint working group with key South Korea shipbuilders to establish international standards for ammonia effluent discharge, addressing environmental safety and regulatory gaps for ammonia-fuelled vessels.

08 / Paolo Moretti, Rina

Rina unveiled several landmark initiatives and collaborations in 2025 that advance shipping’s journey toward net zero emissions.

In partnership with Italian energy major ENI and shipbuilding group Fincantieri, Rina co-presented the Sustainable Maritime Transport Outlook, a strategic study aimed at accelerating the decarbonisation of maritime transport in line with the Net-Zero 2050 target.

The study outlines practical paths and collaborative frameworks for reducing emissions across the maritime value chain.

Led by chief executive Paulo Moretti, Rina also played a key role as the classification society for Atal Solutions’ retrofitting project, a transformative initiative carried out with Damen Shipyards and Blue Astra Maritime.

The project involves upgrading four bulk carriers with next-generation technologies designed to cut emissions, reduce fuel consumption by more than 25%, and nearly eliminate vessel waste, setting a new benchmark for sustainable ship retrofits.

Further strengthening its role in innovation, Rina granted AiP for a next-generation ultramax bulker design developed by Chinese ship designer Shanghai Design and Research Institute and Greek shipowner Almi Marine. The design features dual-fuel LNG/hydrogen propulsion, battery-assisted systems and an innovative hydrogen-reforming solution.

Rina awarded AiP to Korea Maritime Consultants for a 40,000 cu m LNG-fuelled, hydrogen-ready, liquid CO2 carrier, supporting the advancement of carbon capture, utilisation and storage logistics. The vessel’s flexible and scalable design represents a key step toward building the maritime infrastructure required for a cost-effective net zero transition.

09 / Arun Sharma, Indian Register of Shipping

The Indian Register of Shipping is accelerating its transformation into a provider of green, autonomous and digitally enabled maritime technologies and unveiled a series of strategic initiatives and partnerships in 2025.

In alignment with global decarbonisation goals, the IRS has intensified support for green ship designs and alternative fuel technologies. Key projects underway include a hydrogen fuel cell ferry and unmanned surface vessels.

Under the leadership of executive chairman Arun Sharma, the IRS has also been conducting extensive biofuel trials to evaluate their performance and lifecycle sustainability across various vessel types.

It is collaborating with leading industry partners to advance autonomous vessel technologies, focusing on safe, efficient and regulatory-compliant integration of automation in maritime operations. These initiatives are expected to pave the way for smarter and safer shipping solutions in Indian and global waters.

As part of its digital transformation initiatives, the IRS has partnered with France’s Dassault Systèmes for the rollout of the Virtual Twin for Ships Life Cycle Assessment and 3D Classification using a Dassault Systèmes platform. This integration enables real-time insights across the ship’s lifecycle, from design and construction to operation and maintenance.

As classification and certification partner for the expanding Indian Navy, the IRS continues to strengthen its involvement in key defence shipbuilding projects. These include diving support vessels, fleet support ships and corvettes.

10 / Grzegorz Pettke, Polish Register of Shipping

Building on its 90-year heritage, the Polish Register of Shipping continues to punch above its weight and has emerged as a proactive partner in the global maritime industry’s transition toward cleaner, smarter and safer operations.

Via targeted regulatory updates and strategic engagement with international partners, the organisation continues to evolve beyond its traditional classification role to become a comprehensive compliance and innovation partner.

One of the PRS’s major milestones in 2025 was the upgrade of its Rules for the Classification and Construction of High-Speed Craft, now extended to include high-speed catamarans.

This development enables the PRS to offer new classification services for shipowners operating in demanding offshore environments — such as crew transfer vessels supporting wind farms and oil rigs.

In parallel, the PRS, led by president Grzegorz Pettke, is investing in the future of maritime autonomy by developing dedicated guidelines for autonomous and automated technologies and expanding its certification services in this rapidly advancing field.

Through new partnerships and market expansion, particularly across Asia and the Middle East, the PRS continues to extend its global influence.

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) offers a practical solution for sectors where decarbonisation is difficult, helping to prevent vast volumes of CO₂ from entering the atmosphere.
“It can also be used to generate low-carbon power by gas power stations with carbon capture and storage as well as enabling hydrogen power.
Capture CO₂ is separated from other gases produced by industrial activity, including steelworks, cement plants and coal or natural-gas-fired power stations.
""It will be an important part of our industrial future.” What are the benefits of carbon capture and storage?","Carbon capture and storage is becoming one of the most important technologies available to support global climate goals.

As emissions rise globally, international bodies including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) highlight that cutting emissions alone is no longer enough to limit temperature increases to 1.5°C.

Technologies that prevent or remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere are forming a vital part of the global response.

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) offers a practical solution for sectors where decarbonisation is difficult, helping to prevent vast volumes of CO₂ from entering the atmosphere.

“It can also be used to generate low-carbon power by gas power stations with carbon capture and storage as well as enabling hydrogen power.

“These sources of power are important for when the sun isn’t shining and the wind isn’t blowing.”

According to National Grid, CCS focuses on emissions from power generation and industrial processes such as cement, steel and hydrogen production.

Once captured, CO₂ is transported by pipeline, road or ship and injected deep into geological formations for permanent storage.

Suitable storage sites include saline aquifers and depleted oil or gas reservoirs, which must sit at least 1km underground.

CCUS focuses not only on storing CO₂ but also on converting it into useful products including plastics, concrete or biofuel.

“Scaling CCU could be an economic opportunity while offering an additional path to abate CO₂ emissions,” said Fernando Gómez, Head of the Future of Materials at the World Economic Forum.

“With credible policy signals, long-term investment and cross-sector partnerships, CO₂ could mature from a liability into an asset creating new market value while accelerating industrial decarbonization.”

How does CCS work?

CCS follows a three stage process and according to industry body the Global CCS Institute, CCS is a proven technology that has been in safe operation for more than 45 years.

Capture

CO₂ is separated from other gases produced by industrial activity, including steelworks, cement plants and coal or natural-gas-fired power stations.

Capture methods vary depending on the facility but generally purify CO₂ so it can be economically transported.

Transport

After separation, the CO₂ is compressed into a liquid and dehydrated, then transported to a storage location.

Large-scale CO₂ transport already takes place globally via pipelines, tanks and shipping routes.

Storage

Finally, the CO₂ is injected into deep rock formations at depths of one kilometre or more.

These formations are similar to those that have trapped oil and gas for millions of years, providing long-term containment.

“CCUS provides the lowest cost pathway to reaching net zero which is why the independent Climate Change Committee has declared it a ‘necessity, not an option,’ says Chris Stark, former CEO at the Climate Change Committee and Head of Mission Control for Clean Power 2030 at the Department of Energy Security & Net Zero.

""CCUS gives a range of options to decarbonise that would otherwise not be possible and it minimises the climate warming emissions released to the atmosphere on our journey to net zero.

""It will be an important part of our industrial future.”

What are the benefits of carbon capture and storage?

The IPCC’s latest assessment identifies CCS as a critical mitigation option, particularly in heavy industrial sectors where alternative solutions are limited.

By preventing CO₂ from reaching the atmosphere, CCS could offer immediate and significant reductions in emissions that would otherwise be extremely difficult to avoid.

According to the International Maritime Organization: ""CCS can be combined with bioenergy (BECCS) to reduce harmful emissions, effectively removing CO₂ from the atmosphere. This combination is vital for scenarios that limit global warming to 1.5°C or 2°C.""

“CCUS technologies are critical to put energy systems around the world on a sustainable path,” says Mathilde Fajardy, Energy Technology & Policy Analyst at the International Energy Agency.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/55cf22ac9165ba834e702a841c7721ec:a47fa833634e6e787047d823c8c5688c/carbon-capture.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-12-02 11:56:46.493265

“Large container vessels present a unique propulsion challenge,” said WinGD vice president, market development, Benny Hilström. “They demand immense power, exceptional efficiency and long-term fuel flexibility. With the X-DF-HP, we are providing operators with a purpose-built solution for the most power-hungry vessels, offering uncompromised, trouble-free propulsion.”

It is available with the same auxiliary system requirements – such as fuel supply pressure – as other recognised engine concepts.

“The X-DF-HP is built on the high-pressure Diesel X92-B engine platform that has already proven itself as one of the most efficient and reliable large-bore solutions in the container segment,” said WinGD vice president R&D Sebastian Hensel. “Building on our long-standing diesel engine expertise and our deep experience in LNG dual-fuel technology, we’ve developed the X‑DF‑HP. Our tests and simulations show the X-DF-HP will deliver a clear step-up in fuel efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions-reduction performance compared with existing high-pressure dual-fuel engines on the market.”

The X-DF-HP joins the company’s high-pressure, multi-fuel portfolio, which includes the methanol/ethanol-capable X-DF-M/E and ammonia-fuelled X-DF-A engines.

WinGD said, “With LNG providing FuelEU Maritime compliance well into the next decade, and uncertainty remaining around future IMO requirements, LNG continues to offer a cost-competitive, low-risk route to fleet decarbonisation. WinGD’s X-DF (low pressure) and X-DF-HP engines are fully compatible with renewable methane blends, enabling operators to progress towards lower-carbon operations without extensive mechanical modifications or the high retrofitting costs typically associated with emerging fuels.”

“For ultra-large container ships choosing LNG as their pathway to net zero, the X-DF-HP is the most cost-effective option,” added Mr Hilström.

Methanol uptake in maritime

DNV’s latest report on the state of methanol uptake in the shipping sector showed that some 450 methanol-capable vessels had been ordered or were in operation. DNV said that the fuel enjoyed ’high readiness levels’ with ""a strong platform for wider adoption"" in maritime. In particular, China is investing heavily in methanol production, DNV said.

The fuel also offers ""environmental benefits"", according to DNV, among these the fact that it is ""sulfur-free, produces negligible soot and emits significantly less NOx than fuel oil"". DNV said that ""certain bio- and e-methanol pathways can deliver very low or even negative life-cycle emissions"" and that methanol’s reliance on ""established technologies and infrastructure"" and ""availability of interim bunkering solutions may also reduce complexity and cost for shipowners"".

“While regulatory uncertainty remains, the drive for maritime decarbonisation continues to be led by cargo owners and shipowners,” Mr Stefanatos said, ""with uptake dominated by LNG-fuelled vessels, primarily"" among container ships.

DNV and LNG as an ’alternative fuel’

Despite the healthy list of pros for methane uptake and its apparent environmental credentials, DNV’s report pointed to the ""significant barriers"" of cost and availability of methanol and ""many alternative fuels"".

In September 2025, an IMO meeting beset by procedural delays from petro-states saw postponement of a decision that sought to define, among other decarbonisation policies, a series so-called fuel ’pathways’ to bring shipping to net-zero emissions around 2050.

In the lead-up to the meeting, DNV Maritime chief executive Knut Ørbeck-Nilssen signalled support for the fossil fuel LNG, despite the fuel’s known problem with ’fugitive emissions’ of methane, a greenhouse gas with an atmospheric warming intensity many times that of carbon dioxide.

At the time, the DNV Maritime chief executive called for IMO to keep ""all pathways"" for decarbonising shipping operations open. Mr Ørbeck-Nilssen said IMO could achieve this by not heavily penalising the use of some fossil fuels, particularly liquefied natural gas.

In the DNV report on methanol, Mr Ørbeck-Nilssen said “As the maritime industry explores pathways to a lower-carbon future, it is important to consider a range of practical and scalable solutions. There is no one-size-fits-all answer, and different shipping segments and geographies will require different approaches.

Container shipping leads non-conventional fuelled new ship orders but tanker orders undergo late surge

According to DNV’s tracking, the container shipping segment accounted for nearly two-thirds (66%) of newbuild ship orders with non-conventional fuel capability throughout 2025. Of the 10 vessels ordered in November, six came from the box shipping sector and four from the tanker sector.

While container ship ordering has maintained its strength throughout 2025, tanker shipping has seen a surge of orders through the second half of the year.

Among a number of shipyards taking in tanker orders, Hengli Heavy Industries stands out, with recent BRL data showing the Dalian yard holding commitments for 20 VLCCs signed in the past few weeks alone, supported by speculative construction of VLCCs and Suezmax tankers and new dock capacity to clear a growing backlog. Hengli detailed in a video how its batch-pricing and building strategy has a significant part to play in the recent boom in VLCC orders.

Mr Stefanatos said, however, that the 10 alternative-fuelled ship orders in November represented a slowing of ordering more broadly.

“Following a stronger month in October, ordering of alternative-fuelled vessels has slowed down again, reflecting broader market trends in the second half of the year,"" he said.

Overall in 2025, with the pace of ship ordering slowing in November and the total standing at just 232 new alternative-fuelled vessel orders with a month to go, the year’s numbers are pacing at roughly half of the alternative fuel-capable newbuilding ship orders placed in 2024.",https://dvzpv6x5302g1.cloudfront.net/AcuCustom/Sitename/DAM/182/Knut-rbeck-Nilssen_CEO-Maritime_DNV_2webzhgf1_Thumb.png,N,,2025-12-02 07:56:20.738897

This partnership reflects our commitment to innovation and sustainability as we work towards greener shipping operations. Auramarine’s expertise and reliable solutions play a key role in supporting our efforts to reduce emissions and lead the way in adopting alternative fuels across our fleet.”

The order comes months after Finnlines announced the addition of three new Hansa Superstar class vessels, set for delivery in 2028 and 2029, to operate on the Finland–Germany route. Designed by Deltamarin, these 240-metre vessels are said to represent a significant step in sustainable maritime transport, each offering 5,100 lane meters for cargo, accommodation for up to 1,100 passengers, and a garage for some 60 cars.

John Bergman, CEO of Auramarine, commented: “We are proud to collaborate with Finnlines in this forward-looking project, supporting the transition to new sustainable fuels and helping move the industry towards greener, more efficient operations in the Baltic Sea and in Europe overall. Even though the IMO’s decision on the Net Zero Framework has been postponed, Auramarine remains steadfast in supporting the maritime industry’s green transition.

“We are fully committed to helping our customers advance their decarbonization journey by providing reliable alternative fuel solutions and partnering in the development of more sustainable shipping—regardless of regulatory delays.”

The three ships, which will be built at China Merchants Weihai Shipyard, will feature multi-fuel engines capable of running on methanol and leverage a suite of green technologies, including modern hull and high-efficiency propeller design, shore power connectivity, and waste heat recovery systems—collectively reducing CO2 emissions compared to current vessels on the route.

As a result, Auramarine’s fuel supply systems, which will be delivered to China Merchants Weihai Shipyard during autumn 2026 and winter 2027, are expected to play a crucial role in enabling the safe use of fuels on these vessels. The company will design and deliver these fuel supply systems to all three vessels alongside control and ESD automations.

In addition, industry stakeholders are already investing in the fuel, with China accounting for 43 percent of planned global low-GHG methanol production capacity. But, as with all alternative fuels, methanol’s future role will depend on a combination of regulatory, economic, and operational factors.

Knut Ørbeck-Nilssen (pictured), CEO Maritime at DNV said: “As the maritime industry explores pathways to a lower-carbon future, it is important to consider a range of practical and scalable solutions. There is no one-size-fits-all answer, and different shipping segments and geographies will require different approaches. Methanol is one option that draws on established technologies and infrastructure, and it is encouraging to see the industry’s growing interest in a variety of alternative fuels.”

Methanol can offer environmental benefits. It is sulphur-free, produces negligible soot, and emits significantly less NOx than fuel oil. The report highlights that certain bio- and e-methanol pathways can deliver very low or even negative lifecycle emissions, and that methanol’s compatibility with existing port infrastructure and the availability of interim bunkering solutions may also reduce complexity and cost for shipowners.

However, the report notes that cost and availability remain significant barriers, as is the case for many alternative fuels. Bio-methanol prices in 2025 average around USD 2,500 per tonne MGOe, roughly three times the cost of marine gas oil, while global production stands at just 2.2 million tonnes, far below the potential demand of up to 60 million tonnes by 2040. The report models four demand scenarios, showing that regulatory frameworks such as the IMO’s Net-Zero Framework and FuelEU Maritime could be decisive in scaling up adoption.

Revisiting the barrier dashboard for methanol

Fuel availability

To date, demand for low-GHG methanol from shipping has been modest, and most methanol used on ships has been fossil methanol on methanol carriers. Only small volumes of bio-methanol have been bunkered since 2023. According to the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA), methanol bunker sales in Singapore increased from 300 t in 2023 to 1,600 t in 2024.

Although the specific methanol type was not disclosed, the volumes for 2023 refer to green methanol, as in July that year, the port conducted the world’s first ship-to-containership green methanol bunkering operation.

The Port of Rotterdam reported slightly higher bio-methanol volumes, with 800 t sold in 2023, increasing to 4,000 t in 2024 and reaching 11,800 t by Q3 2025. Other examples of methanol bunkering are reported at half a dozen locations around the world in recent years. Maersk reported the first volumes of e-methanol being bunkered in Denmark in May 2025.

Production is dominated by the US (1.9 Mt) followed by China (0.2 Mt). With demand projected to increase, the outlook for production is important. The AFI database shows a portfolio of projects labelled as ‘decided’ which amounts to a capacity of about 14 Mt by 2030, with roughly 30% of capacity for e-methanol projects and 70% for bio-methanol. This added capacity is mainly from additional projects in China.

Importantly, these future estimates are highly uncertain. For many, the fuel cost is prohibitively high in the short term pending the full impact of global regulations and GHG pricing mechanisms.

In the short term, only a limited number of ships are expected to operate on low-GHG methanol; these vessels will be dual-fuel capable, allowing them to utilize fuel oil as well. An increase in demand will occur when regulations or other substantial incentives drive the fuel transition.",https://safety4sea.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/shutterstock_2197288765-e1753186987847.jpg,N,,2025-12-02 07:56:45.622959

The Methane Abatement in Maritime Innovation Initiative (MAMII) hosted its first event in Brussels last week, bringing shipowners, engine designers, technology providers and EU policymakers together to accelerate efforts to reduce methane emissions from shipping.

Led by Safetytech Accelerator, established by Lloyd’s Register, MAMII is a coalition of shipping leaders, which aims to reduce the environmental impact of liquefied natural gas (LNG) in shipping while assisting the transition to future fuel solutions.

Delegates discussed the rapid advances in methane measurement and abatement and the need for stronger alignment between innovation and regulation, as well as the right mix between action and accuracy.

With methane recognised as 28 times more potent than CO2 on a 100-year scale and the second most significant GHG emission, participants underscored that methane abatement represents one of the fastest, most impactful climate solutions available to shipping today.

The event examined developments across the full emissions chain.

Upstream transparency is improving through enhanced monitoring tools, enabling more informed LNG sourcing. However, tank-to-wake emissions, where combustion slip remains the dominant contributor, remain the largest challenge. Several engine types have seen 60–70% reductions in methane slip in recent years, supported by the emergence of aftertreatment systems that could scale reductions up to an additional 80–90%.

Technology providers demonstrated solutions ranging from catalyst-based aftertreatment and advanced sensor systems to AI-driven emissions analysis and handheld methane leak detection devices for pipelines.

Shell’s Technology Manager, Stephen Brown, confirmed that the company’s in-house methane abatement catalyst system will enter shipboard trials in December. This marks the third MAMII-member aftertreatment technology trial. Early results from all member trials have been positive, and commercial readiness is expected as soon as 2027.

Industry representatives called for clearer, predictable and science-based frameworks that provide certainty for investment. They highlighted the importance of updated default values reflecting technological progress, reliable measurement methodologies, and incentives for early adopters alongside support for retrofitting. Alignment between EU and IMO regulations was seen as essential for global consistency and operational clarity.

Panos Mitrou, MAMII chair and Lloyd’s Register Global Gas Segment Director, said:“Methane abatement is both a climate obligation and a strategic opportunity for technology development. It is a great example for the industry to demonstrate action and compliance. It can offer substantial emissions reductions, generating positive cash flows and balance, in carbon cost measures.

“The Brussels event marked a significant milestone for our initiative, strengthening cooperation between regulators, industry and innovators.

“The consensus was clear: momentum is building, solutions are advancing rapidly and reducing methane emissions is within reach for the maritime sector. We must now focus on expanding these solutions to global fleets, improving the data supporting our decisions, and guiding the industry confidently towards significant methane reduction.”",https://cyprusshippingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/New-Project-15.jpg,N,,2025-12-02 07:56:50.623646

LR recently issued Navigating Nuclear Energy in Maritime, a new guidance document providing the first roadmap for the safe and responsible use of nuclear technology in commercial shipping and offshore industries.","Nuclear-powered containerships have the potential to eliminate bunker costs, cut greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and deliver faster transit times, while maintaining safety and economic competitiveness.

The findings are drawn from a new Lloyd’s Register and LucidCatalyst report for Seaspan Corporation Pte. Ltd. The report examines the technical, economic, and regulatory potential of integrating small modular reactors (SMRs) into the containership fleet. LucidCatalyst performed a comprehensive analysis of the costs and benefits for Seaspan’s business model and collaboratively developed requirements that, if met, would create significant value.

For vessel operators, nuclear-powered vessels eliminate their largest operating costs, up to $50 million annually in bunker fuel and an estimated $18 million in carbon penalties.

According to the analysis, a single 15,000 TEU nuclear-powered containership operating at 25 knots (39% faster than conventional vessels) could deliver up to 38% higher annual cargo capacity compared to conventionally fuelled vessels through a combination of increased speed (enabling 6.3 versus 5 round voyages annually) and 5% additional container space from the elimination of fuel tanks and systems.

The report highlights that translating these requirements into a rigorous, requirements-led supply chain and procurement strategy, through a cross-industry consortium, is essential for widespread success. If industry pledges to purchase more than 1,000 units in 10–15 years, it estimates that modular reactors could be produced for US$750–1,000 per kilowatt, significantly cheaper than conventional nuclear power plants, and maintained within standard vessel drydock cycles. Each unit would be designed to operate for around five years between refuelling, drastically reducing downtime and providing independence from global bunkering networks.

The study outlines a roadmap showing how manufactured nuclear propulsion units could reach commercial readiness within four years of starting an intensive program, with total system costs below $4,000/kW and fuel costs under $50/MWh. Market modelling indicates potential uptake of 40–90 GW by 2050, depending on regulatory progress and industry adoption.

The findings also point to best practices for designing a competitive supply chain that provides depth of supply, competition on price and performance, and avoids vendor ‘lock-in’, as well as innovative reactor and fuel-leasing models that could help shipowners and operators manage upfront costs while maintaining safety and regulatory compliance.

The report forms the first phase of a three-part programme. The next stage will focus on concept design and regulatory readiness, including engagement with shipyards, port authorities, and nuclear regulators. A final phase will create a detailed implementation roadmap, outlining risk management, certification, and investment strategies for large-scale deployment.

Meg Dowling, Senior Engineer – Nuclear Technology and Alternative Fuels, Lloyd’s Register, said: “The energy transition and long-term sustainability challenges of shipping demands long-term solutions that can scale. Nuclear propulsion offers not just a decarbonised solution, but a transformative economic opportunity for shipowners and charterers alike. The results of this research give us a strong foundation to define how systems can be integrated within the commercial fleet to provide a credible pathway towards safe, commercially viable, zero-emission shipping.”

Peter Jackson, Chief Technology Officer at Seaspan Corporation Pte. Ltd., said: “As part of our ongoing efforts to find safe and commercially viable energy transition pathways, we have partnered with LR and Lucid Catalyst to explore nuclear propulsion for containerships. Small Modular Reactors (SMR’s) is a very exciting technology offering several desirable benefits for shipowners and operators, as outlined in this report. Naturally there are challenges to overcome, but I am confident that ongoing work in this area and studies like this will soon allow nuclear powered containerships to be operating safely, economically, and emission free.”

Eric Ingersoll, Managing Partner, LucidCatalyst, added: “Nuclear propulsion transforms shipping economics, not just emissions. Our analysis shows that nuclear-powered containerships will likely outcompete conventionally fuelled and green fuelled competitors—dominating their trading routes through superior performance without requiring green premiums. The key to unlocking this advantage is organising the market through sophisticated supply chain and technology strategies. By forming a cross-industry consortium, we can build a responsive supply chain and achieve competitive reactor costs, making nuclear the economically optimal choice for shipowners and charterers alike.”

Second generation biofuels, also referred to as advanced biofuels, are produced from non-food biomass: residues, waste oils, lignocellulosic material (wood, straw, waste or used cooking oil to make hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) which can directly be used in an internal combustion engine).
Although these second generation biofuels still create competition for land use, they are generally credited with better sustainability and a higher potential for GHG reduction.
Their production is easier to scale up except for biofuels produced from used cooking oil as the supply is small and hard to collect.
Third generation biofuels are to be produced from high productivity biomass such as algae.","Pierre Aury gives readers a renewable fuels guide.

As the International Maritime Organization has decided to postpone by one year the approval of its proposed Net Zero Framework (NZF) we have decided to use that opportunity to try to cast some light on what are renewable fuels, biofuels, and e-fuels.

Between the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) which is pricing emissions and the more recent FuelEU Maritime regulations which are setting fuel-performance standards in fact setting limits on the greenhouse gas well‑to‑wake intensity of the energy used at sea and mandates cold ironing in port, there is a strong incentive to move away from carbon intensive fossil fuels to lower‑carbon or even better no-carbon fuels. The IMO postponed NZF is very similar to FuelEU so it will, when adopted, create a worldwide incentive to move to renewable fuels… at least that is the theory.

So what is a renewable fuel? It is a fuel produced from sources that naturally replenish on a short timescale. Wood for example is a renewable fuel. But wood is pretty useless, as wood, when it comes to powering ships. The EU and the IMO have in mind biofuels and e-fuels.

First generation biofuels are produced from crops rich in sugar, starch, or oils (e.g., ethanol from corn or sugarcane or biodiesel from rapeseed). Most of the ethanol used in cars today is a first generation biofuel. The main issues with these biofuels are food versus fuel competition, potential change in land use and the difficulty to scale up production.

Second generation biofuels, also referred to as advanced biofuels, are produced from non-food biomass: residues, waste oils, lignocellulosic material (wood, straw, waste or used cooking oil to make hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) which can directly be used in an internal combustion engine). Although these second generation biofuels still create competition for land use, they are generally credited with better sustainability and a higher potential for GHG reduction. Their production is easier to scale up except for biofuels produced from used cooking oil as the supply is small and hard to collect. Third generation biofuels are to be produced from high productivity biomass such as algae. The main advantages will be, if these go past the proof of concept phase which is not obvious, that there will be no competition with food/land use and that the production will be easier to scale up. They are promising but it is still early stage and could be costly.

Now let us deal with e-fuels (e for electro) / syn fuels (syn for synthetic). They are fuels made by combining hydrogen (from renewable powered electrolysis) with captured CO₂ to create hydrocarbons or alcohols (e‑methanol, e‑diesel, e-methane, e-ammonia). When both electricity and CO₂ inputs are renewable or biogenic, they can be nearly carbon‑neutral but are energy-intensive and very expensive today. Green refers to a fuel produced using hydrogen which has been produced using renewable electricity when blue refers to a fuel produced from fossil fuels associated with carbon capture and storage (CCS). Biogenic CO2 refers to CO2 coming from the combustion or decomposition of biomass, plant or animal material… or biofuels! Are you lost?

Before we conclude a word on ammonia: please stop considering this as a fuel for shipping! It is too dangerous.

Now departing from the theory above, practically and regardless of the above-described fuel chosen, none can be deployed at scale quickly enough to meet the bold target of decarbonised shipping by 2050.",https://splash247.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BHP-Oldendorff-Biofuels-Bunkering-Singapore.jpg,N,,2025-12-02 03:56:14.243964

“What looks like a pause is, in reality, an open door for national governments to move ahead with their own systems,” Mr Ioulianou said.
According to Mr Ioulianou, more governments are likely to follow, driven as much by fiscal pressures as environmental goals.
That should concern everyone.” Mr Ioulianou also raised concerns about how revenues from emerging national carbon schemes will be used.
“Managing this manually, port by port or across scattered spreadsheets, is no longer realistic,” he said.","Philippos Ioulianou, Managing Director of EmissionLink, has warned the IMO’s decision to delay its Net Zero Framework is creating a regulatory vacuum that threatens to fragment global shipping decarbonisation efforts.

“What looks like a pause is, in reality, an open door for national governments to move ahead with their own systems,” Mr Ioulianou said. “Instead of gaining clarity, we risk creating a patchwork of unaligned carbon schemes that will make global compliance significantly harder for shipowners.”

Several countries are already moving to fill the void. The UK’s Emissions Trading Scheme (UK ETS) will come into force in June 2026, Turkey is preparing its own version, and Gabon on Africa’s west coast has openly discussed a local carbon levy. According to Mr Ioulianou, more governments are likely to follow, driven as much by fiscal pressures as environmental goals.

“For many governments facing widening budget gaps, carbon pricing offers a quick route to new revenue,” he noted. “Without a unified global framework, carbon markets could become less about decarbonisation and more about balancing the books.”

Mr Ioulianou warns that regionalised systems will multiply reporting formats, verification rules and administrative burdens, creating real operational risks.

“Good luck to the shipowner who gets it wrong. Picture a vessel calling at a West African port, unaware of a newly introduced local regulation. The port authority could detain it for non-compliance and the owner is left footing the bill”, he said.

He added that some owners are already adjusting trade patterns to avoid overlapping schemes. “We’re hearing from Asian owners who are quietly steering clear of certain European routes due to compliance complexity. That should concern everyone.”

Mr Ioulianou also raised concerns about how revenues from emerging national carbon schemes will be used.

“There is no assurance that these funds will flow back into decarbonisation,” he said. “Some governments won’t even know how much they’ll collect until year-end and once the money arrives, the temptation to redirect it to other priorities will be strong.”

With more uncertainty set to continue, Mr Ioulianou urged shipowners to strengthen their approach to monitoring and managing compliance.

“Managing this manually, port by port or across scattered spreadsheets, is no longer realistic,” he said. “Owners need real-time intelligence on regulatory changes and data they can act on — long before they reach the next port of call.”

Mr Ioulianou highlighted EmissionLink’s role in supporting the industry through this shift. “We continuously track global emissions schemes, translating fast-moving regulation into practical guidance. Our aim is to help owners stay compliant, keep trading and avoid being caught out by local policy changes.”

Without decisive action from the IMO, Mr Ioulianou warned, the trend toward regionalisation could become irreversible.

“Every new national scheme makes it harder for the IMO to rebuild a globally aligned approach later,” he said. “Once rules fracture into regional pieces, putting them back together will be extremely difficult.”",,N,,2025-12-01 20:57:31.586931

Based on comparisons between the efficiency of WinGD’s established diesel engines and similar dual-fuel designs, the high-pressure dual-fuel concept is anticipated to deliver improved efficiency.
“Large container vessels present a unique propulsion challenge,” said Benny Hilström, Vice President, Market Development at WinGD.
“Building on our long-standing diesel engine expertise and our deep experience in LNG dual-fuel technology, we’ve developed the X‑DF‑HP.
This provides operators with a fully fuel-flexible platform, with established engines such as the X92-B now able to be retrofitted for high-pressure LNG, methanol, ethanol, or ammonia as fuel pathways evolve.","Swiss marine power company WinGD has introduced its first high-pressure LNG dual-fuel engine, the X-DF-HP, developed specifically for the demanding operating profiles of ultra-large container vessels (ULCVs).

Unveiled at Marintec China 2025, the new engine arrives at a pivotal moment for shipowners navigating the energy transition, with the IMO’s Net Zero Framework currently paused and the prospect of regional regulation becoming increasingly fragmented. As a result, interest in LNG-fuelled tonnage continues to accelerate.

Available in X82 and X92 bore sizes, the X-DF-HP is tailored to the scale, speed and load requirements of the ULCV sector, with first deliveries planned for 2028. Based on comparisons between the efficiency of WinGD’s established diesel engines and similar dual-fuel designs, the high-pressure dual-fuel concept is anticipated to deliver improved efficiency.

“Large container vessels present a unique propulsion challenge,” said Benny Hilström, Vice President, Market Development at WinGD. “They demand immense power, exceptional efficiency and long-term fuel flexibility. With the X-DF-HP, we are providing operators with a purpose-built solution for the most power-hungry vessels, offering uncompromised, trouble-free propulsion.”

Available with the same auxiliary system requirements—such as fuel supply pressure—as other recognised engine concepts, it supports straightforward installation for shipyards and provides a practical, future-ready option for vessel owners. Achieving Tier III compliance in both gas and diesel modes using only a standard SCR, X-DF-HP offers operators a powerful, space-efficient and future-ready choice for the most demanding ultra-large container vessels.

“The X-DF-HP is built on the high-pressure Diesel X92-B engine platform that has already proven itself as one of the most efficient and reliable large-bore solutions in the container segment,” said Sebastian Hensel, Vice President R&D at WinGD. “Building on our long-standing diesel engine expertise and our deep experience in LNG dual-fuel technology, we’ve developed the X‑DF‑HP. Our tests and simulations show the X-DF-HP will deliver a clear step up in fuel efficiency and GHG performance compared to existing high-pressure dual-fuel engines on the market.”

The X-DF-HP builds on more than a century of high-pressure Diesel cycle expertise and dual-fuel innovation at WinGD. It joins the company’s high-pressure, multi-fuel portfolio, which includes the methanol/ethanol-capable X-DF-M/E and ammonia-fuelled X-DF-A engines. This provides operators with a fully fuel-flexible platform, with established engines such as the X92-B now able to be retrofitted for high-pressure LNG, methanol, ethanol, or ammonia as fuel pathways evolve.

With LNG providing FuelEU Maritime compliance well into the next decade, and uncertainty remaining around future IMO requirements, LNG continues to offer a cost-competitive, low-risk route to fleet decarbonisation. WinGD’s X-DF (low pressure) and X-DF-HP engines are fully compatible with renewable methane blends, enabling operators to progress towards lower-carbon operations without extensive mechanical modifications or the high retrofitting costs typically associated with emerging fuels.",,N,,2025-12-01 18:58:15.395612

European shipowners welcome the plan as a good first step that identifies many gaps and shortcomings in the existing European policy and finance framework.
Another key concern for European shipping is the absence of a binding mandate on fuel suppliers.
European Shipowners firmly support reducing administrative burden, especially for SMEs, and therefore welcome the Commission’s commitment to review reporting requirements and simplify the rules.
“Ensuring an international level playing field is essential for the competitiveness of European shipping.","An EU push to accelerate the uptake of clean fuels has been broadly welcomed by the maritime sector. Despite the positive mood music, industry leaders note that the Commission’s €2.9 billion Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP) could prove limited to meet the scale of the transition.

In early November, the European Commission presented STIP as a strategic framework for the energy transition in all modes of transport, with a focus on aviation and waterborne transport.

Speaking at the European Parliament on 27 November, Commissioner Maria Luís Albuquerque highlighted the importance of renewable and low-carbon fuels for the aviation and maritime sectors, as well as for EU strategic autonomy. “We need to boost the development and production in Europe,” she acknowledged, adding that China and the US are advancing fast.

European shipowners welcome the plan as a good first step that identifies many gaps and shortcomings in the existing European policy and finance framework.

“STIP is putting investments in clean fuels at the centre of the competitiveness agenda. These investments are necessary for retaining industrial capacity, for enhancing competitiveness, for reducing energy dependencies, and for getting to net zero,” Sotiris Raptis, Secretary General of European Shipowners (ECSA), remarked in a statement.

For the Union of Greek Shipowners (UGS), STIP represents a positive and timely initiative by the Commission, recognising industry concerns notably on fuel availability, technological neutrality, and investment needs. However, it was noted that real sectoral investment needs exceed the projected funds, while the proposed financing tools may not align with day-to-day operating models.

Funding and mandate gaps

This plan is expected to mobilise at least €2.9 billion by the end of 2027, and according to Albuquerque, around 20 million tons of sustainable alternative fuels will be needed by 2035 to comply with aviation and maritime regulations, requiring an investment of some 100 billion euros. In addition to the almost €3 billion, a study will soon be launched to explore possible long-term models, as “stakeholders agree on the need for an intermediary mechanism connecting fuel producers and buyers to de-risk investments,” she added.

For the shipping industry, the projected €2.9 billion represents only a small share of the investment required to narrow the fourfold price gap between conventional and clean fuels.

At the same time, Greek shipowners expressed concerns that the proposed double-sided auction model may not effectively support much of European shipping, particularly for bulk and tramp operators that rely on spot-market, non-contractual operations.

Another key concern for European shipping is the absence of a binding mandate on fuel suppliers. While STIP acknowledges the need to accelerate the uptake of clean fuels, it stops short of requiring European suppliers to make Sustainable Marine Fuels (SMF) available across the market, a gap not seen in other transport sectors, such as aviation.

Notable steps forward

Despite this slate of concerns, the Commission’s proposal is viewed as including several constructive approaches, recognising gaps in the current European policy while placing clean-fuel investment at the centre of the EU’s competitiveness agenda.

One key positive note is that the Commission explicitly acknowledges LNG’s contribution to emissions reduction as a transitional fuel, a welcome reaffirmation of its recognition under the EU Green Deal. Promoting bilateral partnerships and green shipping hubs in global markets to accelerate fuel production and infrastructure development is also viewed as an added advantage in the proposal.

In addition, the exploration of new financial tools beyond the Innovation Fund is, in itself, considered a positive step by the industry, which is also supporting the possibility of a dedicated funding mechanism for the maritime sector.

ECSA welcomed the plan’s proposal to use national Emissions Trading System (ETS) revenues to support clean-fuel uptake in shipping, stressing that the sector’s €9 billion contribution should help narrow the large cost gap with low-carbon fuels.

As an initial step toward a future mandate, shipowners back the plan’s commitment to strengthen incentives under the Renewable Energy Directive and FuelEU Maritime.

“STIP takes a major first step towards the use of the national ETS revenues to make clean fuels for shipping available at a competitive price,” Raptis said, adding that a binding requirement on suppliers must eventually match such funding.

Also, the reference to small and medium-sized enterprises and the diversity of shipping segments is a significant and long-awaited nod for the sector.

This broader understanding reflects the operational reality of the bulk and tramp sector, which is 85% of global seaborne trade and represents two-thirds of European shipping and operates under different business models. The inclusion of green shipping hubs further acknowledges the bulk and tramp sector’s operational model, where flexible, global routing requires fuel availability across a vast network of ports.

European Shipowners firmly support reducing administrative burden, especially for SMEs, and therefore welcome the Commission’s commitment to review reporting requirements and simplify the rules.

The industry also highlighted the Commission’s commitment to exploring a single MRV system covering both the ETS Maritime and FuelEU Maritime, which would be an important step towards reducing administrative burden, particularly for SMEs.

Moving forward

ECSA has argued that the EU should also send a clear message on the full alignment of EU climate legislation with the IMO international measures, when adopted.

“Ensuring an international level playing field is essential for the competitiveness of European shipping. We expect a clear message from the Commission that the EU will fully align its policy framework with international measures when adopted at the IMO level,” Raptis remarked.

As Greek shipowners pointed out, a binding fuel-supplier mandate should be introduced to guarantee market availability of sustainable, safe and regulation-compliant maritime fuels across EU ports.

UGS also urges the Commission to maintain technological neutrality, especially for the hardest-to-abate sectors, such as shipping. Administrative simplification and reduction of reporting burdens, especially for SMEs, will remain crucial to safeguard competitiveness and operational efficiency.

The study further concludes that responsibility for crew training is distributed across multiple stakeholders — including equipment suppliers, system integrators, shipyards, shipowners, educators, and regulatory authorities.","CIMAC and the Maritime Battery Forum (MBF) have published the second paper on the environmental impact of batteries in deep-sea shipping, highlighting how establishing clear and harmonized training frameworks is the next crucial step.

After analyzing the use cases and application areas for batteries in the joint whitepaper by CIMAC and the Maritime Battery Forum entitled “Environment for the Use of Batteries in Deep-Sea Shipping”, published in 2024, the next step was to identify current challenges prohibiting the adoption of battery systems in deep-sea shipping related to regulations and safety.

In this the second edition of the whitepaper, the current regulatory landscape for maritime batteries has been thoroughly analyzed, and it was concluded that current regulations provide sufficient support for batteries design, installation and testing for application in deep-sea shipping.

However, a lack in crew training regulations has been identified. Therefore, impact on crew and the requirements for crew training for battery powered ships is investigated and analyzed to develop an overview and recommendations for crew training requirements for ship owners, operators, flag states and maritime authorities.

Impact on crew training – Current status of crew training requirements

Only two relevant guidelines for crew training requirements on board battery powered ships have been found:

European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA): Guidance on the Safety of BESS on board ships – Version 1.0 November 2023, Annex B – Guidance for officer’s qualification.

Sjøfartsdirektoratet (Norwegian Maritime Authority): Circular Series V – Guidelines on requirements for training in chemical energy storage (maritime battery systems) on board Norwegian ships.

Additionally, a relevant requirement in the Red Ensign Group Yacht Code: Annex A -Battery systems guidance for installation, stowage and operation-, paragraph A7 – July 2024, has been found. Here it is stated: “Crew training – it is recommended that at no time shall there be less than two persons on the vessel who are adequately trained and experienced in all battery equipment and procedures. In addition, all crew shall have an awareness of the vessel’s emergency procedures regarding the battery.”

The IMO does not have specific guidelines or resolutions about Li-ion batteries training for crew. The IMO publications that include training requirements applicable also to Li-ion batteries are:

ISM Code 6.3 – mandates ship managers to establish procedures for personnel in safety and environmental roles, to ensure proper familiarization with their duties.

ISM Code 6.5 – highlights the importance of identifying and providing necessary training to support safety management systems.

STCW Convention Regulation I/14-5 – recalls the need for companies to familiarize seafarers with their duties, ship arrangements, equipment, and relevant aspects.

At the IMO Human Element, Training and Watchkeeping (HTW 11) meeting on 10-14 February 2025 it has been agreed to begin the development of interim guidelines for training seafarers on ships using alternative fuels and new technologies, including battery powered ships.

The study further concludes that responsibility for crew training is distributed across multiple stakeholders — including equipment suppliers, system integrators, shipyards, shipowners, educators, and regulatory authorities.

However, this distributed responsibility requires clearer definition and coordination to ensure that all crew members, from operational to managerial levels, receive appropriate and consistent training.

The transition to battery-powered deep-sea vessels is no longer constrained primarily by technical or regulatory limitations, but rather by the human and organizational readiness to operate, maintain, and manage these new energy systems safely and effectively.

WinGD added that interest in LNG-fuelled ships has continued to grow, particularly after the IMO’s Net Zero Framework failed to secure adoption earlier this year.

The engine will be available in X82 and X92 bore sizes, with the first deliveries planned for 2028.

WinGD said its evaluations show the new high-pressure engine is expected to run more efficiently than similar dual-fuel designs.

According to Mr Ioulianou, more governments are likely to follow, driven as much by fiscal pressures as environmental goals.
That should concern everyone.” Mr Ioulianou also raised concerns about how revenues from emerging national carbon schemes will be used.

“What looks like a pause is, in reality, an open door for national governments to move ahead with their own systems,” Mr Ioulianou said. “Instead of gaining clarity, we risk creating a patchwork of unaligned carbon schemes that will make global compliance significantly harder for shipowners.”

Several countries are already moving to fill the void. The UK’s Emissions Trading Scheme (UK ETS) will come into force in June 2026, Turkey is preparing its own version, and Gabon on Africa’s west coast has openly discussed a local carbon levy. According to Mr Ioulianou, more governments are likely to follow, driven as much by fiscal pressures as environmental goals.

“For many governments facing widening budget gaps, carbon pricing offers a quick route to new revenue,” he noted. “Without a unified global framework, carbon markets could become less about decarbonisation and more about balancing the books.”

Mr Ioulianou warns that regionalised systems will multiply reporting formats, verification rules and administrative burdens, creating real operational risks.

“Good luck to the shipowner who gets it wrong. Picture a vessel calling at a West African port, unaware of a newly introduced local regulation. The port authority could detain it for non-compliance and the owner is left footing the bill”, he said.

He added that some owners are already adjusting trade patterns to avoid overlapping schemes. “We’re hearing from Asian owners who are quietly steering clear of certain European routes due to compliance complexity. That should concern everyone.”

Mr Ioulianou also raised concerns about how revenues from emerging national carbon schemes will be used.

“There is no assurance that these funds will flow back into decarbonisation,” he said. “Some governments won’t even know how much they’ll collect until year-end and once the money arrives, the temptation to redirect it to other priorities will be strong.”

With more uncertainty set to continue, Mr Ioulianou urged shipowners to strengthen their approach to monitoring and managing compliance.

“Managing this manually, port by port or across scattered spreadsheets, is no longer realistic,” he said. “Owners need real-time intelligence on regulatory changes and data they can act on — long before they reach the next port of call.”

Mr Ioulianou highlighted EmissionLink’s role in supporting the industry through this shift. “We continuously track global emissions schemes, translating fast-moving regulation into practical guidance. Our aim is to help owners stay compliant, keep trading and avoid being caught out by local policy changes.”

Without decisive action from the IMO, Mr Ioulianou warned, the trend toward regionalisation could become irreversible.

“Every new national scheme makes it harder for the IMO to rebuild a globally aligned approach later,” he said. “Once rules fracture into regional pieces, putting them back together will be extremely difficult.”

Annelies Verlinden, Minister of Justice and the North Sea, Government of Belgium, expressed disappointment over the delay, noting “It was a disappointment that a net zero framework did not land yet, but I will not give up. I see that there is still a lot of energy within IMO and within many countries to move forward in that direction.”

Jeremy Sutton, Chief Executive Officer of Swire Shipping, described the postponement as a surprise but stressed the importance of moving forward:

We just need to carry on. This is not the end, it’s a moment to reset and focus on the future

Similarly, Kamal-Deen Ali, Director General of the Ghana Maritime Authority, highlighted the opportunity the delay presents saying that if we expand the dialogue and include everyone, we should find a way forward.

It is probably the best outcome considering the negotiations have taken so long. Now it’s just a delay of 12 months, and I think we can cope with that

… said Zahid Osman, President and Group CEO of MISC Group.

While the delay extends uncertainty over how shipping’s transition to zero emissions will be regulated, experts suggested it also opens the door for adjustments that could ultimately strengthen adoption.

Global collaboration remains key

In addition, the industry leaders emphasized that multilateral cooperation is critical to addressing climate and geopolitical challenges.

Given geopolitical tensions, given climate change, we really need to invest in multilateralism, working together, collaboration to overcome these issues

… said Annelies Verlinden. Meanwhile, Kamal-Deen Ali stressed the need to support the Global South in adjusting to short-term impacts of decarbonization:

We all know that we are supposed to contribute towards decarbonization. But the question is how do you get the Global South to adjust to the short-term shocks?

In addition, Arvin Boolell, Minister of Blue Economy and Fisheries, Government of Mauritius, highlighted the unique vulnerabilities of small economies saying that there is a call for special and differential treatment given to least developing countries and small economies. Lessons learned now will provide better clarity and certainty in implementation at the next IMO meeting.

Navigating a multi-fuel future

The conversation also focused on the practical realities of decarbonizing shipping, particularly the availability of green fuels.

The key for shipping is to have available green fuels. At the moment, availability is very limited. There are many pathways—ammonia, hydrogen, methanol, biofuel—but we are putting our resources into ammonia, which we believe has a better chance for adoption

…. Zahid Osman noted.

Furthermore, Jeremy Sutton emphasized a diversified approach saying “We’re very keen on biofuels and are already bunkering many of our ships with them. I encourage us not to dismiss any options. The front runners will become apparent over time.”

A new vote on the so-called IMO Net-Zero Framework is scheduled to take place in October 2026 (the “Framework”).

The decision delays clarity for ship owners, ship builders and fuel producers on regulations that would underpin investments for decarbonising international shipping, which many of the world’s largest shipowners have committed to pursuing. However, it creates opportunities for further closing gaps and addressing the concerns of certain countries ahead of the rescheduled vote in 2026.

In formal terms, this was not a vote on the Framework itself, though political objections to its implementation brought about the postponement. There is reason to think that, unless the politics change, there will be further hurdles to its adoption. The postponement of the decision on the Net-Zero Framework keeps the proposed instrument alive for a further year, during which we may see its shape and scope change.

Overview of the Proposed IMO Net-Zero Framework

The Framework, which was provisionally agreed by the IMO in April 2025 but which had not yet been formally voted into international law, aims to provide significant incentives for shipowners – and the fuel producers and bunkering companies supplying them – to substitute unabated fossil-derived fuels for renewable and low-carbon fuels. It proposed doing so through imposing both a mandatory limit on the carbon intensity of energy used aboard ships, together with a system of penalties on non-compliant ships through a form of global carbon pricing mechanism, the amount of which would differ depending on the actual carbon intensity of a ship’s energy use.

The Framework is intended to be a key pillar of the IMO’s revised Strategy on the Reduction of Greenhouse Gas (“GHG”) Emissions from Ships, which was adopted by the IMO in 2023. The Strategy targets net-zero maritime GHG emissions by or around 2050 through accelerating deployment of zero and near-zero GHG emissions technologies, fuels and/or energy sources, including renewable and low-carbon fuels. Although recent events call into question support for the Framework as currently drafted, the overarching policy objective of the IMO remains in place.

For more information on the content and structure of the proposed Framework, see our previous Client Alert.

Context of the October Meeting in London

In the run-up to the October meeting of the IMO in London, several states submitted comments, studies, and observations to the IMO, with some expressing concerns about the Framework.

The United States, in particular, strongly opposed the Framework’s adoption. It submitted an impact assessment to the MEPC, urging states to reject the Framework, citing the significant economic burden it would impose on the global commercial shipping industry. Additionally, in a Joint Statement issued by the Secretaries of State for Energy and Transportation, the United States called on countries to oppose the adoption and outlined possible measures against nations that supported the Framework.

Alongside the United States, other countries, including Bahrain, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Sierra Leone, the United Arab Emirates, and Venezuela, submitted a detailed socio-economic analysis to the MEPC, highlighting the inflationary impact of the Framework on commodity costs.

Conversely, the European Union (“EU”), through a statement issued by the European Commission on October 12, 2025, reiterated support for the Framework, describing it as “a significant milestone.”

For some, an objectionable aspect of the proposed Framework was the manner in which it deferred responsibility for defining important future aspects of the rules to the IMO Secretariat (rather than the states parties to the MARPOL Convention) without sufficient controls, safeguards or parameters for states. In other words, states are concerned that there would have been significant discretionary power reposed in the Secretariat that would not necessarily be subject to approval by the states parties to the Framework, and were also concerned about the potential expansion of IMO discretionary power over time.

What Happened at the IMO Meeting in London in October 2025?

On October 17, 2025, during the final day of the extraordinary MEPC session, a majority of 57 states voted to postpone the formal vote on the Framework for one year, while 49 voted to proceed to a vote and 29 abstained or were not present. As a result, the vote on the adoption of the IMO Framework was delayed and rescheduled for 12 months’ time, i.e. likely in October 2026.

Due to the postponement, the earliest possible entry into force for the Framework would be March 1, 2028 (should it be adopted in October 2026) following the mandatory acceptance period required prior to its entry into force.

There is likely to be significant diplomatic activity from states and other interested parties between now and the next meeting of the MEPC in late April 2026. In addition, the IMO has continued working, through Intersessional Working Groups, to continue developing the implementing guidelines contemplated under the Framework. These guidelines would not only be important for the implementation of the Framework (should it be adopted) but their details could also be instrumental in facilitating a potential consensus amongst states during the forthcoming negotiations on the Framework’s future shape.

Concluding Remarks and Next Steps

Many of the world’s largest shipping companies have already made corporate commitments to decarbonise their fleets and are investing in ships with alternative technologies and fuel supply chains, including LNG, ammonia and methanol, of the fossil fuel, e-fuel, low-carbon and biofuel varieties. Since the IMO Framework takes a technology-neutral approach, focussing on GHG emissions rather than picking and choosing technology winners, all of those sources of energy could play a role. Prospective fuel producers seeking to deploy some or all of these technologies around the world need the regulatory clarity from clear adoption of harmonised rules at the international level to support their investments and allow the signing of long-term offtake agreements and the raising of finance to fund infrastructure. The prolonged uncertainty also creates challenges for ship builders and designers, given the high cost of retrofit to convert vessels to alternative fuel sources and the long capital life of new ships. This may lead to higher upfront costs for building in greater fuel-switch capabilities for new ships, to allow adaptation to the evolving regulatory landscape over time.

Shortly after the outcome of the IMO October meeting, the EU published an updated policy position paper: its “Sustainable Transport Investment Plan” (“STIP”). In the STIP, the EU reiterates that it is fully committed to meeting the decarbonisation mandates imposed under EU law on the maritime and aviation sectors. In the maritime sector, the EU Emissions Trading System (“EU ETS”) and FuelEU Maritime Regulation already impose decarbonisation requirements on shipping. This is because those EU regulations apply to 50% of the GHG emissions from voyages between an EU and a third country. In the STIP, the EU made clear that it will maintain these regulations and seek to provide further financial support to stimulate production of renewable fuels (both e-fuels and biofuels) to facilitate compliance. The timing of the STIP’s publication in the wake of the IMO decision is no coincidence: the EU continues to emphasise a commitment to decarbonising the maritime and aviation sectors despite headwinds from other key stakeholders among the international community.

However, without other key global players on board, unilateral imposition of rules to decarbonise international shipping creates political risk and regulatory instability that undercut the investment thesis for would-be low-carbon fuel producers and users. The next 12 months provide an opportunity for states to further shape the rules to identify whether a consensus can be reached. The outcomes of the next formal meeting of the MEPC in late April 2026 will be a crucial temperature check.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.12073_3056.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 11:56:36.770652

More than 30 NOCs have joined the Oil and Gas Decarbonization Charter (OGDC) and are engaging in initiatives to tackle methane emissions and flaring.

There is a major opportunity for NOCs looking to implement best practices in methane management to learn from the experience of peers in order to deploy strategies that are adapted and tailored to their circumstances. Best practices include adopting measures to limit flaring and venting, implementing leak detection and repair programmes, and deploying low-emissions equipment. This report explores these opportunities in view of NOCs’ distinctive characteristics, including their ties to national policy priorities.

Executive summary

NOCs have a crucial role to play in shaping the outlook for methane emissions. Rapid and cost-effective measures to tackle methane emissions by NOCs could deliver an annual reduction of up to 30 million tonnes (Mt) of methane by 2030, an impact comparable to eliminating all CO2 emissions from the global aviation industry. This report aims to support NOCs on their methane reduction journey.

Around half of the oil and gas produced by NOCs is covered by pledges to achieve near-zero methane emissions by 2030. NOCs are tackling methane emissions in line with policy goals, to improve their sustainability credentials, and to attract financing. Key opportunities to accelerate action include:

Integrating methane management into operations. Dedicated resources and plans are key to support effective capital and operational spending on methane abatement. Half of the options to reduce emissions in the oil and gas industry could be deployed with positive rates of return, improving natural gas resource use and cash flows.

Working with host governments and partner companies to unlock synergies and align goals. NOCs can play a major role in supporting policy objectives. In over 30 countries where NOCs are responsible for more than half of oil and gas production, methane is already included in the scope of their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).

Implementing best practices. This includes adopting measures to limit flaring and venting, implementing leak detection and repair programmes, and deploying low-emissions equipment. Many of these mitigation options do not require measured emissions data or large investments. Flaring reductions by NOCs could make 60 billion cubic metres of natural gas available for domestic consumption or for export.

Develop a methane monitoring, reporting, and verification system based on emissions measurements. This would enable a better assessment of abatement options and a credible way to track progress over time. It would also help meet market and regulatory requirements such as those of the European Union’s (EU) methane regulation.

Make the most of supporting initiatives. Many initiatives support oil and gas methane reductions, offering technical resources, capacity building and financing. These can help NOCs overcome existing barriers and take action that is tailored to their national contexts.

As informed, the project is backed by a €5 million pledge from the European Union, confirmed during a recent signing ceremony (26 November). The goal is to promote economic growth, environmental protection, and social development, with a specific focus on strengthening gender balance within the maritime sector. The project’s work is structured around four core objectives:

1. Strengthening maritime governance

The project will provide technical assistance and facilitate consultations to help African countries align their national policies and laws with MARPOL Annex VI requirements and IMO climate goals. This includes updating national legislation to meet current international standards.

2. Advancing alternative fuel infrastructure

To accelerate the maritime decarbonization transition, the project will conduct feasibility studies and develop “bankable” business cases for the establishment of bunkering facilities for alternative fuels and the creation of green corridor projects in selected African ports.

3. Enhancing digitalization and Maritime Single Window (MSW) implementation

Efforts in this area involve carrying out readiness assessments and developing national roadmaps for the Maritime Single Window (MSW). The objective is to improve data interoperability, strengthen data security, and enhance regulatory compliance and environmental reporting efficiency.

4. Upgrading maritime Education and Training (MET)

The initiative will also focus on improving curricula to include training on alternative fuels, biodiversity protection, and digital technologies. This objective includes providing dedicated training and scholarships to equip a diverse workforce with the necessary new skills for the future maritime industry.

Beneficiary Selection

Five Sub-Saharan African countries will be selected to benefit from the project through an open Expression of Interest process.

The selection will be undertaken based on a range of considerations, including the availability of needs assessments, the need to avoid duplication of efforts, demonstrated political commitment to maritime decarbonization, potential for alternative fuel production and trade facilitation, as well as clearly identified needs for institutional strengthening.

In an interview on Friday, Lloyd’s Register chief executive Nick Brown spoke about the state of shipping’s journey to net zero, and what is in store for the years ahead, given October’s big International Maritime Organization delay.

He said that net zero would cost trillions of dollars and wasn’t going to happen without consumers and governments wanting it to.

It is clear by now that a green hydrogen economy is not going to happen for most industries; it is silly to go to the trouble of building hydrogen cars when electric vehicles are cheaper and better, for example.

There won’t be enough biofuels to run all of shipping without chopping down forests, and carbon capture has a woeful track record and pretty ropey economics.

Nuclear could be great, but is probably decades, not years, away.

So, my thorny question for a while has been: can shipping, through its unusually powerful global regulator, build a hydrogen economy all of its own, even if the rest of the world doesn’t?

Nick Brown thinks not, and isn’t alone. UCL’s green shipping wonks think it can be done, with the right policy and the kind of mega-stimulus that saw technologies such as solar and wind get going.

But since this is about policy, it’s ultimately about what voters will pay for.

Taxing one part of a supply chain doesn’t cut the emissions, it just moves them elsewhere.

Before the mess of the Net-Zero Framework, the simple carbon levy plan won previously unthinkable levels of support at the IMO. So, it’s not as if the times aren’t a-changing.

But they will have to change a lot more for the decarbonisation of shipping to get anywhere. The industry needs a better way to cut the costs of change, to remedy the impact of new taxes on states, and to make people in those states care about it.

It’s almost as if you can’t decarbonise shipping while ignoring the politics and economics of the wider global economy.

S4S: Maritime incidents can have both human and environmental consequences.
S4S: Maritime operations often face connectivity challenges at sea.
FleetVision provides real-time visibility across the fleet, transforms video and operational data into practical AI insights, and delivers a unified operating picture for ship and shore.","In an exclusive interview with Osher Perry, CEO of ShipIn, we explore the emerging trends shaping the future of shipping and how technology will transform this dynamic sector, provided that operators embrace it not as an add-on but as a core operational strategy.

One of the most exciting shifts underway is the move toward AI-assisted operations. Osher highlights the key capabilities of FleetVision™, which provides real-time visibility across the fleet, transforms video and operational data into actionable AI insights, and delivers a unified operating picture for both ship and shore. According to Osher, the connected fleet of the future will be intelligent, transparent, and continuously learning. Data will flow seamlessly from every vessel to every stakeholder, turning ships into truly smart assets. In this environment, enhanced safety and a more proactive operational approach will become the norm, incidents will be prevented rather than merely documented after they occur. “ShipIn is the intelligent layer that makes this vision a reality,” Osher emphasized.

SAFETY4SEA: What is ShipIn’s philosophy for the maritime sector, and what are your top priorities for the next five years?

Osher Perry: At ShipIn, our philosophy is straightforward: every fleet can operate smarter, safer, and more efficiently when vessels and shore teams are truly connected. We believe that visibility is the foundation of good decision-making, and by giving shipowners and managers clear, real-time insights into what’s happening onboard, we help them shift from reactive responses to proactive operations. Over the next five years, our top priorities are to expand FleetVision™ capabilities across safety, technical, and operational domains, scale our AI models to deliver even more predictive insights, and strengthen partnerships with shipowners, operators, and insurers to establish new industry standards. At the same time, we are committed to enabling seamless fleet-wide connectivity—regardless of vessel age, type, or trade—so that every ship can benefit from the full power of connected intelligence.

S4S: What do you see as the biggest challenges and opportunities for the maritime sector over the next decade, particularly with emerging technologies and digital trends?

O.P.: The maritime industry faces several pressing challenges, including a persistent shortage of skilled crew that leads to higher workloads and greater operational risk, increasing regulatory pressure related to safety, emissions, and ESG reporting, and fragmented data silos across legacy systems that make fleetwide decision-making difficult. At the same time, there are powerful opportunities: the adoption of AI and automation can amplify crew capabilities and reduce human error; digital twins and predictive maintenance can significantly improve asset longevity; and greater standardization and data-driven collaboration between ship and shore can unlock efficiencies that were previously out of reach. The next decade will favor operators who embrace technology not as an add-on, but as a core operational strategy.

S4S: Maritime incidents can have both human and environmental consequences. How does ShipIn’s platform help prevent such incidents before they happen?

O.P.: FleetVision™ transforms onboard operators from incident responders to incident preventers. Through dedicated modules for MARPOL, Bridge, Technical, and Safety, the platform detects unsafe behaviors, equipment anomalies, and operational deviations as they occur—whether it’s a near-miss on deck, improper PPE usage flagged by the Safety module, a potential navigation or watchkeeping lapse identified by the Bridge module, an early sign of machinery or engine-room failure surfaced by the Technical module, or a possible MARPOL breach such as abnormal discharge patterns or non-compliant emissions. Alerts are sent instantly to both ship and shore personnel, enabling intervention before an incident escalates. This proactive, module-driven approach reduces injuries, downtime, and environmental exposure across the entire fleet.

S4S: What’s been the most surprising insight you’ve gained from deploying FleetVision™ in real-world operations?

O.P.: One of the most striking lessons is that small, consistent behaviors can have a disproportionately large impact on safety and performance across an entire fleet. When ships gain visibility into frequent near-misses—incidents that would normally go unreported or dismissed as routine—crews naturally start to adjust their actions on their own. In this way, transparency itself becomes a powerful safety tool and culture driver, well before any formal training programs, new procedures, or external audits take place.

S4S: Beyond performance metrics, how has FleetVision™ influenced onboard culture – for example, around safety awareness or teamwork?

O.P.: FleetVision™ helps build a culture of shared awareness and genuine teamwork on board. Instead of feeling “policed” for compliance, crews see clear, visual analytics that show how to improve everyday operations. For example, teams can review mooring operations together to spot safer line-handling practices, or analyze near-misses on deck to adjust PPE usage and housekeeping routines. Officers gain a clearer view of where coaching is needed—such as navigation procedures on the bridge or maintenance workflows—while crew members feel guided and supported rather than watched. This shifts conversations from blame to learning. Across our deployments, we’ve seen stronger safety ownership, smoother bridge communication, and better alignment between ship and shore teams. When everyone—from the master to the office HSEQ team—can see the same picture, collaboration and trust grow naturally, leading to safer, more confident operations at sea.

S4S: Maritime operations often face connectivity challenges at sea. How does ShipIn ensure reliable, real-time alerts and analytics in that environment?

O.P.: ShipIn’s Edge AI is the on-vessel “brain” behind the FleetVision™ platform—the intelligence that runs right next to the cameras, instead of depending on a distant data center. Built for maritime constraints from day one, FleetVision™ performs all critical analysis locally on the vessel, so crews receive real-time alerts and guidance even when there is no internet or satellite connectivity at all. Only summarized insights and selected events are sent ashore when bandwidth becomes available, using highly compressed data bursts designed for low-connectivity environments. Ships stay informed in real time, and shore teams receive timely information without overwhelming satellite networks.

S4S: Which innovation or technological shift in the maritime sector excites you the most right now, and why?

O.P.: The most exciting change underway is the shift toward AI-assisted operations, where technology acts as a true co-pilot for both crew and shore teams. Instead of relying solely on human vigilance, vessels can now benefit from automated situational awareness that continuously monitors equipment, environments, and workflows. Predictive failure detection flags issues before they escalate, giving teams time to plan maintenance and avoid costly downtime. By fusing data from cameras, sensors, logs, and other onboard systems, AI helps present a clearer operational picture and supports faster, more confident decision-making. This is not about automation replacing people—it’s about automation empowering people, amplifying their expertise, and enabling them to run safer, more efficient, and more resilient operations.

S4S: What does the “connected fleet of the future” look like to you, and what role will ShipIn play in making that vision a reality?

O.P.: The connected fleet of the future is intelligent, transparent, and always learning. Data flows effortlessly from every vessel to every stakeholder, turning ships into truly smart assets. Incidents are anticipated and prevented rather than simply logged after the fact. Maintenance shifts from reactive troubleshooting to planned, data-driven care. Crew workloads are reduced as routine tasks are automated, while safety, compliance, and performance steadily improve. ShipIn is the intelligent layer that makes this vision real. FleetVision provides real-time visibility across the fleet, transforms video and operational data into practical AI insights, and delivers a unified operating picture for ship and shore. With ShipIn, fleets move from hindsight to foresight, empowering teams to protect people, assets, and operations.

S4S: How are Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics transforming digital innovation across the maritime ecosystem?

O.P.: AI is transforming maritime from a paper-heavy, audit-driven sector into a real-time, insight-led industry. Instead of relying only on past reports, operators can now use data analytics to benchmark vessels, spot performance drift early, and manage safety consistently across entire fleets. When combined with machine learning, these tools reveal patterns that were previously impossible to see—from subtle navigation deviations to emerging technical anomalies—before they escalate into incidents or costly downtime. This shift is not theoretical or experimental anymore. AI solutions are already being deployed in day-to-day operations, shaping how decisions are made on board and ashore. For companies that embrace it, AI is quickly becoming a core competitive advantage, enabling safer, more efficient, and more predictable shipping.

S4S: Are there any new developments or upcoming projects at ShipIn that you’d like to share with the industry?

O.P.: FleetVision™ is also becoming smarter and more connected. By integrating data from ECDIS for navigation, onboard weather systems, engine performance sensors, and existing fleet management platforms, the solution builds a richer, real-time picture of each vessel’s operating profile. This enables more advanced predictive capabilities that can identify risks before they manifest—from navigational issues to machinery deviations and other operational hazards. At the same time, we are deepening collaborations with shipowners and insurers to embed proactive, data-driven risk management into everyday workflows. Manual processes—such as reporting near misses or updating planned maintenance records—are increasingly supplemented with automatically generated logs and reports, reducing admin burden while improving accuracy and timeliness. By feeding structured, visual, and analytics-driven insights directly into the systems they already use, FleetVision™ helps make safer, more efficient performance the industry default rather than the exception.

S4S: If you could change one thing about the maritime industry today to accelerate digital adoption, what would it be?

O.P.: I would focus on dramatically increasing standardization and data transparency across the maritime industry. Today, too much valuable information is trapped in silos—separated between vessels, departments, vendors, and even different software platforms. This fragmentation slows progress, makes benchmarking difficult, and limits the impact of digital initiatives. If we can align around common data models, reporting standards, and shared KPIs, everything else becomes easier. Digital adoption accelerates because systems can talk to each other. ROI becomes clearer as companies can compare performance on a like-for-like basis. Collaboration between shipowners, managers, insurers, and technology providers becomes more meaningful, because everyone is working from the same factual foundation. In short, standardization and transparency are not just technical goals; they are the enablers that unlock real transformation at scale.

S4S: Finally, what key message would you like to share with maritime stakeholders about embracing innovation as a driver of growth and sustainability?

O.P.: Innovation in shipping is no longer optional—it’s a responsibility to crews, customers, and the planet. With mounting pressure around safety, sustainability, and operational efficiency, digital tools have become essential to staying competitive and compliant. The approach doesn’t need to be overwhelming: start small, scale fast, and stay committed. Even targeted steps—like introducing real-time analytics, AI-assisted monitoring, or smarter reporting—can unlock meaningful gains in safety, fuel efficiency, and decision-making quality. Over time, these incremental changes add up to a step-change in fleet performance. Most importantly, they help protect your most valuable asset: your people. By embracing innovation as an ongoing journey rather than a one-off project, maritime leaders can build safer, more resilient, and future-ready operations.

Manual fire-fighting equipment, tools and procedures Existing and new fire-fighting equipment were tested in different projects as regards as EV fires.","The “Safe Transport of Alternative Fuel Vehicles on Ro-Ro Ships (STARSS)” study was conducted by Bureau Veritas and RISE Research Institutes of Sweden. The first report provides an overview of the regulatory landscape governing the safe transportation of AFVs, including a review of regulations, rules and guidelines across both maritime and non-maritime domains.

According to the report, recent fire accidents at sea, such as the fires on the Fremantle Highway and Morning Midas have further raised concerns regarding safe transportation of vehicles. In particular AFVs has received the attention of the industry as well as regulatory authorities. In response, several shipping companies have implemented proactive measures to ensure the safety of passengers and crew.

These measures include to go above and beyond the required fire safety standards, by adding fire-fighting equipment (e.g. fire blanket and thermal imaging camera), upgrading firefighters’ outfits, offering specialized fire-fighting training, and a doubling of the carbon dioxide quantity on board vehicle carriers. In some cases, transportation of EVs has even been completely banned to ensure safety before knowledge is updated.

Together with the ongoing discussions in the International Maritime Organization (IMO) Sub-Committees on Carriage of Cargoes and Containers (CCC) and Ship Systems and Equipment (SSE), this indicates the need for increased understanding of the fire behaviour of AFVs.

Key findings

#1 Regulatory review

In general, the reviewed documents tend to agree that a combination of heat and smoke fixed detection systems coupled with a water-based fire-extinguishing system are a reliable solution to detect, cool down and prevent the fire spread in case of lithium-ion batteries thermal runaway events.

However, for vehicle carriers which are generally not equipped with water-based fire-extinguishing systems or, for container carriers, where the accessibility to the batteries inside a container is complicated, alternative solutions are proposed such as increasing the capacity of the fixed gas-based fire-extinguishing system.

From the guidelines issued by the industry community and insurances, the prevention and mitigation of fire risks is also coming from operational constraints such as the verification of the battery conditions during the loading stage or crew training. These points are difficult to verify and therefore difficult to encompass in the regulatory framework.

Based on this regulatory study, some knowledge gaps are surfacing leading to the need of scientific and technical studies, experiments and modelling on specific items such as the efficiency of foam-based fire-extinguishing systems.

Lastly, from the review of the land-based documents, it was found that most of the measures for the safe transportation / use of AFVs on land are common with maritime. However, some interesting measures solely in land-based can be highlighted and further investigated for adoption in maritime.

#2 Technical and scientific review

Fire and gas detection

Research on early detection of causes triggered an EV fire, such as thermal runaway, is on-going. This research addresses technologies, such as gas detection, video fire detection, battery management system (BMS) monitoring or temperature-based detection methods.

The on-going projects will also address the performance of existing fire detection system in ro-ro spaces, i.e. spot-type smoke and heat detectors, and will compare them with the aforementioned technologies.

Fixed fire-extinguishing systems

The existing research tends to agree that the existing provisions in ro-ro spaces for fixed water-based existing systems should be sufficient. However, as the capacity of the batteries increases, it may be worth to verify their performance on larger types of battery electric vehicles.

The research related to the performance of fixed foam and gas (CO2) fire-extinguishing systems involving battery electric vehicles are scarcer. Several projects on that systems are on-going. Recent projects on the performance of outside air foam system are encouraging but performance under actual marine conditions still need to be further investigated.

A survey documented that CO2 was used in eleven of the 22 fires on ro-ro vehicle carriers occurring from 2013 to 2023. In five of these verified incidents, the fire was suppressed or extinguished.

For the cases when fire was not extinguished, a long delay time combined with the fact that the space was not sufficiently sealed may explain the poor performance. None of the eleven fires involved battery electric vehicles.

Manual fire-fighting equipment, tools and procedures

Existing and new fire-fighting equipment were tested in different projects as regards as EV fires. Based on results from field tests, existing equipment (e.g. fire hose nozzle) and new equipment such as portable water curtain were found to be complementary tactical options.

However, the crew members need to be well trained and prepared to handle them.

Research on other new equipment such as fire blankets, brine-based fire-fighting system and battery pack flooding devices progress well. Their safe deployment in ro-ro spaces still need to be further investigated.

From the review, manual fire-fighting in the space of origin of the fire was not found to be the best option in case of EV fire, even impractical in vehicle carriers, and to be rather used in complement of fixed fire-extinguishing system, e.g. for boundary cooling or for re-ignition purpose.

Some projects have developed guidelines for fire-fighting procedures and even training programmes. Those materials can be useful to ship operators in order to develop their company procedures.

Explosion risk and mitigation

Research exists on explosion risk and mitigation in Battery Energy Storage System enclosures, but no research was identified related to ro-ro space. This is clearly identified as a knowledge gap.

Numerical modelling and simulations

Several numerical models enable the assessment of AFV hazards in ro-ro spaces. Simpler tools can be used for quick and preliminary assessment but are generally limited to open air configurations with limited effects of geometry.

For more detailed assessment, in particular in enclosed spaces such as closed ro-ro spaces, CFD tools shall be used. However, such tools require specific resources and competences.

In complement to experimental data, numerical simulations were found to be necessary to understand and assess the hazards on domain such as fire and smoke spread, effect of the ventilation or tenability conditions.

The Philippines is keeping its seat for the years 2026-2027 in the International Maritime Organization (IMO) Council under Category C, composed of 20 member states with special interests in maritime transport or navigation.

The IMO Council serves as the executive organ and is in charge of supervising the work of the organization, a specialized agency of the United Nations.

The Philippines has been an IMO member since 1964 and Council member since 1997.

The country’s reelection in the IMO Council reaffirms “its vital role in shaping global maritime policy and advancing seafarer welfare,” the Philippine Maritime Industry Authority (MARINA) said in a statement.

The council Category C ensures representation of all major geographic areas of the world.

Philippine ambassador to the United Kingdom Teodoro Locsin Jr., who represented the country’s candidature, highlighted the Philippines’ key role in the maritime sector, noting that one in every five seafarers worldwide is Filipino.

“We renew our unwavering commitment to ensure that the seas that connect us are seas of safety, sustainability, and shared prosperity,” Locsin said. “The Philippines brings to the Council a perspective grounded in experience, shaped by vulnerability, and driven by hope.”

There are more than half a million Filipino seafarers serving across fleets worldwide and the Philippines consistently ranks among the top contributors to the global maritime labor force.

MARINA administrator Sonia Malaluan also welcomed the result, calling it a renewed mandate to champion seafarers and maritime safety at the highest level.

“We are all glad to have again joined the IMO Council – a sign of the Philippines’ leadership in maritime,” she said. “It means a louder voice for seafarers, their rights, safety, and well-being. We raised the flag.”

The IMO Assembly elected member states across three categories that will make up the council for the next term.

Category A is composed of the 10 states with the largest interest in providing international shipping services. These are: China, Greece, Italy, Japan, Liberia, Norway, Panama, the Republic of Korea, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

“Instead of gaining clarity, we risk creating a patchwork of unaligned carbon schemes that will make global compliance significantly harder for shipowners.” Several countries are already moving to fill the void.
According to Mr Ioulianou, more governments are likely to follow, driven as much by fiscal pressures as environmental goals.
“For many governments facing widening budget gaps, carbon pricing offers a quick route to new revenue,” he noted.
That should concern everyone.” Mr Ioulianou also raised concerns about how revenues from emerging national carbon schemes will be used.","Philippos Ioulianou, Managing Director of EmissionLink, has warned the IMO’s decision to delay its Net Zero Framework is creating a regulatory vacuum that threatens to fragment global shipping decarbonization efforts.

“What looks like a pause is, in reality, an open door for national governments to move ahead with their own systems,” Mr Ioulianou said. “Instead of gaining clarity, we risk creating a patchwork of unaligned carbon schemes that will make global compliance significantly harder for shipowners.”

Several countries are already moving to fill the void. The UK’s Emissions Trading Scheme (UK ETS) will come into force in June 2026, Turkey is preparing its own version, and Gabon on Africa’s west coast has openly discussed a local carbon levy. According to Mr Ioulianou, more governments are likely to follow, driven as much by fiscal pressures as environmental goals.

“For many governments facing widening budget gaps, carbon pricing offers a quick route to new revenue,” he noted. “Without a unified global framework, carbon markets could become less about decarbonization and more about balancing the books.”

Mr Ioulianou warns that regionalized systems will multiply reporting formats, verification rules and administrative burdens, creating real operational risks.

“Good luck to the shipowner who gets it wrong. Picture a vessel calling at a West African port, unaware of a newly introduced local regulation. The port authority could detain it for non-compliance and the owner is left footing the bill”, he said.

He added that some owners are already adjusting trade patterns to avoid overlapping schemes. “We’re hearing from Asian owners who are quietly steering clear of certain European routes due to compliance complexity. That should concern everyone.”

Mr Ioulianou also raised concerns about how revenues from emerging national carbon schemes will be used.

“There is no assurance that these funds will flow back into decarbonisation,” he said. “Some governments won’t even know how much they’ll collect until year-end and once the money arrives, the temptation to redirect it to other priorities will be strong.”

With more uncertainty set to continue, Mr Ioulianou urged shipowners to strengthen their approach to monitoring and managing compliance.

“Managing this manually, port by port or across scattered spreadsheets, is no longer realistic,” he said. “Owners need real-time intelligence on regulatory changes and data they can act on — long before they reach the next port of call.”

Mr Ioulianou highlighted EmissionLink’s role in supporting the industry through this shift. “We continuously track global emissions schemes, translating fast-moving regulation into practical guidance. Our aim is to help owners stay compliant, keep trading and avoid being caught out by local policy changes.”

Without decisive action from the IMO, Mr Ioulianou warned, the trend toward regionalisation could become irreversible.

“Every new national scheme makes it harder for the IMO to rebuild a globally aligned approach later,” he said. “Once rules fracture into regional pieces, putting them back together will be extremely difficult. The delay was meant to give the industry time to adapt. Instead, it risks creating confusion, competition and complacency. The world isn’t waiting for a decision, it’s moving ahead, one emissions scheme at a time.”",https://maritime-executive.com/media/images/article/Philippos-Ioulianou-EmissionsLink.2cce14.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 05:56:07.724742

A new report calls for a cross-sector push to accelerate carbon-neutral fuel development and keep climate ambitions on course.

Accelleron published a report calling for deeper collaboration across industries to unlock the energy transition. The report, titled “Accelerating to Net Zero – Deadlock: What’s stopping shipping’s carbon-neutral fuel transition?,” argues that shipping alone cannot secure the supply of green hydrogen-based e-fuels it needs to meet the IMO’s ambition of reaching net zero emissions by or around 2050.

The report proposes that governments, ports, shipowners and fuel suppliers work closely to break five crucial deadlocks blocking carbon-neutral fuel development, including: fuel demand fragmentation, geographic availability, financing, regulation, and bunkering infrastructure. Alongside maritime industry efforts, a wider approach to collaboration is also needed.

Shipping on its own cannot afford the green hydrogen production investments it needs to deliver carbon-neutral fuels. Nor can any of six other hard-to-abate industrial sectors: aviation, steel, power generation, agriculture, chemicals, and cement. The solution, Accelleron argues, lies in aggregation of demand across these sectors, to deliver an investable opportunity for fuel producers.

But Accelleron itself is not a shipowner, a port or a government, and its industry reach is focused on delivering technology and services to shipping and power generation companies. So, what is Accelleron’s stake in the carbon-neutral fuel transition?

A legacy of innovation

The answer lies partly in our legacy and partly in our mission. The legacy began nearly 120 years ago when Alfred Büchi first patented the turbocharger. Since 1924, when the first commercial design was delivered, that technology has helped shipping do more with less – boosting engine power, reducing fuel consumption and consequently, though it was barely considered at the time, cutting emissions.

Accelleron has been advancing emissions-reducing technology for more than a century, and when it became an independent stock-listed company in 2022, it made decarbonization its new North Star, investing in three levers that cut fuel consumption and emissions: turbocharging, digital optimization, and fuel injection.

Up to 2030 – by which time IMO aims for at least a 20% reduction in overall greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from international shipping, compared to 2008 levels – investing in efficiency will be key. In fact, an IMO-commissioned report from CE Delft found that energy-saving measures alone could meet and even exceed the IMO’s ‘striving for’ ambition of a 30% emissions reduction by 2030.

Driving efficiency and optimization

The study notes that operational measures such as slow steaming and vessel/voyage optimization could constitute roughly 50% of the reduction, technical retrofits about 25%, and zero or near-zero emission (ZNZ) the remaining 25%. Given CE Delft’s contention that applying all measures could add up to a 47% reduction, which implies that efficiency could deliver up to a 35% absolute emissions reduction, surpassing the higher boundary of IMO’s 2030 target.

Efficiency retrofits and operational measures can be implemented quickly, rolled into port stays, and paid back under today’s fuel and carbon prices. For Accelleron, that means turbocharger optimization – including tailoring for slow steaming with Engine Part Load Optimization (EPLO) and, for larger engines, enabling sequential turbocharging with FiTS2 – as well as digital vessel and voyage optimization via its LOREKA360° suite of solutions.

Accelleron has demonstrated the effectiveness of its solutions: a car carrier reduced fuel consumption by 3% after engine derating and turbocharger optimization, with installation during a port stay yielding a rapid return on investment. When combined with a propeller upgrade, the vessel achieved a 25% reduction in both fuel use and emissions, improving its Carbon Intensity Indicator rating.

Meanwhile GESCO, India’s largest private shipowner, replaced manual engine performance checks with a continuous digital process – including automated diagnostics and advisory – via Tekomar XPERT, part of the LOREKA360° platform. The switch delivered annual savings equivalent to US$45,000 per vessel, and was rapidly expanded from two to 48 tankers and bulk carriers, with a cumulative savings of over $2.16 million annually.

The ships are ready

Accelleron’s next-generation turbochargers and dual-fuel injection systems are designed to handle all major fuels, including e-methanol, e-ammonia, e-methane, and hydrogen.

They are engineered for adaptability, reducing retrofit complexity and cost so that ships can pivot quickly once new fuels arrive. A turbocharger can be switched during a normal port stay, making a vessel ready for e-fuels the moment supply reaches scale.

In 2024, nearly half of all tonnage ordered was alternative-fuel capable, according to DNV’s Alternative Fuels Insight (AFI) tool. In 2025, that momentum has accelerated, with the same tool showing a 78% increase in the first half of the year over the same period in 2024. That investment will need to increase to meet the 2040 target, and again in the final push towards 2050.

To achieve the 2040 and 2050 decarbonization targets, further investment will be necessary. With the right regulatory and market incentives, the shipping industry is prepared to adopt carbon-neutral fuels, thanks to decades of innovation and efficiency improvements.

The fuels are missing

But a vital ingredient is missing: the fuel itself, produced at scale and at a competitive cost. This is the challenge the report addresses, proposing key steps that could help shipping find the 150 million tons in annual green hydrogen production that will be needed by 2050. All the investments that the industry – ports, shipowners, fuel suppliers and technology providers including Accelleron – have made will be for nothing unless that happens.

The path Accelleron has travelled over more than 100 years, with even greater intensity since independence in 2022, has been focused on efficiency and enabling the use of carbon-neutral fuels. Accelleron is a key link in the shipping stakeholder chain, and we share our customers’ commitment to see that those investments are not wasted. And, beyond the commercial sphere, Accelleron wants a sustainable future for our generation and future generations on this planet. With the technologies, but without the fuels, we are only halfway there.",https://safety4sea.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/accelleron-net-zero-form-2880x1920-1-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-12-01 05:56:16.613436

Accelleron’s ACCX300-L turbocharger series addresses shipowners’ needs for flexibility and future viability, featuring a compact, modular design adaptable to lower vessel speeds and ready for green methanol and ammonia.

The new turbocharger generation integrates compressor specifications for 2-stroke and 4-stroke applications within one concept and currently comprises the ACCX365-L and ACCX370-L frame sizes.This innovation supports efficient, low-emission shipping, aligning with evolving industry standards and operational requirements.

Greater operational efficiency

Many ship operators use slow steaming to reduce emissions and comply with regulations like the IMO’s Carbon Intensity Indicator. This also helps shipowners lower costs when using expensive, carbon-neutral fuels. Engines and turbochargers must optimize efficiency across a wider range, and the ACCX300-L series is designed for turbocharger cut-out.

Cutting out one turbocharger at low engine loads increases air pressure, compression ratio, and firing pressure, improving efficiency and reducing fuel consumption. Accelleron’s FiTS2 system automates cut-out and cut-in via a control unit, optimizing fuel use while maintaining flexibility for full engine output.

Reduced operating expenses

The ACCX300-L series utilizes a platform approach to maximize modularity. Its easily exchangeable cartridge contains all rotating parts, enabling extraction and installation of the turbocharger core without dismantling the compressor or turbine sides. All casing connections are axially accessible within the turbocharger’s box volume once the air outlet is dismantled.The cartridge, including its transport packaging, fits on a standard shipping pallet.

This cartridge concept is especially valuable for cut-out operation. Turbochargers involved in cut-out have different utilization than those not involved, resulting in varying maintenance needs on the same vessel. The ACCX300-L turbocharger series leverages this cartridge concept, allowing vessel operators to address these maintenance requirements, with major service events possible during port stays as well as dry dock.

Instead of servicing turbochargers every five years, the ability to exchange cartridges in port means the full runtime between overhauls can be used, resulting in increased service intervals and lower operating costs.

Future fuel flexibility

Accelleron’s ACCX300-L series turbochargers feature an advanced turbine and compressor stage designed with increased specific flow capacity and higher pressure ratios. They deliver high efficiency at part and full load, up to a pressure ratio of 5.0, providing optimal turbocharging for a wide range of ship power configurations.

To meet higher engine power needs, Accelleron developed the TWIN concept—parallel combinations of smaller, lighter turbochargers in unconventional pairings of ACCX365-L and ACCX370-L models. This extends cartridge benefits to higher power engines, simplifies transportation and job duration, and enables more complex engine setups and turbocharger cut-out options.

Physical verification of the final product is key to achieving this next level of power density, so Accelleron’s qualification process has included thermos-mechanical integrity testing and performance checks and confirmation of reliability against high and low cycle fatigue.

Other testing has included analysis of the sealing air system and checks for non-uniformity of the inflow into the filter silencer. An investigation into the impact of ammonia-rich gases on turbocharger materials has also been undertaken.

In this episode of The Big Question, Eleanor Butler is joined by Håkan Agnevall, CEO of Wärtsilä, to discuss the importance of the shipping industry and how to make it more sustainable.

How valuable is shipping to our economy?

One of the world’s most famous shipping routes is the Suez Canal. Built in the late 19th century, the artificial waterway bypasses the Horn of Africa and reduces shipping time, cost and emissions between Asia and Europe.

“In 2021 we had this big container vessel, Ever Given, it got stuck in the Suez Canal. The estimates are that every day the cost for the global economy of the Suez Canal being shut down was €10 billion,” Håkan told The Big Question.

According to the OECD, over 80% of global goods are transported by sea. Between 1995-2020, 22.8 million people were employed on average through maritime industries such as shipbuilding, equipment manufacturing, and maritime R&D.

Through shipping’s wider impact on the economy, Håkan estimated that 1 in 5 jobs in Europe depend on the export industry.

Can shipping become more sustainable without harming the economy?

Currently, the shipping industry accounts for around 2-3% of global CO2 emissions. That’s roughly the same as the aviation industry, or Japan — the world’s 5th largest polluter.

As governments and global regulators, like the IMO, work to set new frameworks and emissions targets for the industry, shipping companies are looking for ways to adapt.

“There are about 100,000 large vessels out there in the world and we cannot just scrap them,” Håkan explained.

To reduce the emissions of the existing global fleet, Wärtsilä has developed a carbon capture technology which can extract around 70% of the CO2 from an engine’s exhaust.

Around half of today’s fleet is propelled by diesel, and 48% is prepared for alternative fuels. Håkan highlighted that liquified natural gas (LNG) is categorised as an alternative fuel, despite being a fossil fuel.

Greener alternate fuels are currently being developed but their supply isn’t yet sufficient for sustained usage on long haul shipping.

“These vessels [are] sailing far out at sea, so you really need to find fuels and other things that can sustain that situation,” Håkan explained.

“Methanol engines are being delivered as we speak — engines are ready for the biofuel as they become available.

“Then we have the next step and those are what we call the zero carbon fuels and there you have ammonia for shipping and we are delivering our first ammonia engines as we speak.

“And then we have hydrogen. This fuel, in our view, will be more for the land applications because the energy density of hydrogen is not good enough for big shipping. You will have to have a lot of tanks and then you can carry less cargo.”

Green fuels are currently two to four times more expensive than traditional fossil fuels. A carbon emission levy would level the playing field, narrowing the cost difference between more polluting and cleaner fuels.

Despite the uncertainty around the future of fuels and an impending carbon levy, orders for new ship stocks are increasingly leaning towards green-ready vessels.

Håkan concluded: “The movement has started and I do see it's accelerating. So with a positive perspective, a lot of things are happening. But is it going fast enough? No.”
