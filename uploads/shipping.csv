Introduction

The Suez Canal is a critical maritime artery, connecting the Red Sea to the Mediterranean, facilitating roughly 12-15% of global trade and about 30% of container traffic. It handles approximately 9.2 million barrels of oil daily and generates significant toll revenue for Egypt, crucial for the nation’s economy. Given its strategic importance, any disruption in the Suez Canal can lead to significant ripple effects on global commerce and energy markets, underscoring the need for robust security measures.

Historical Context and Vulnerabilities

The canal’s strategic significance has made it a focal point during historical conflicts. The Suez Crisis in 1956 and the Eight-year closure beginning in 1967 resulted in unprecedented shipping disruptions, compelling vessels to take longer routes. These crises illustrated the canal’s leverage in geopolitics and resulted in significant economic losses, prompting shippers to adjust their operations.

Since then, the canal has remained a vital trade conduit amid regional tensions. However, various security threats still linger, as evidenced by a 2013 foiled terrorist attack and recent assaults on shipping during the Israel-Gaza conflict that began in late 2023, where Houthi rebels targeted vessels in the Red Sea.

Recent Conflicts and Their Impacts

The ongoing attacks by Houthi forces on commercial shipping have prompted significant disruptions. Many shipping firms suspended or rerouted vessels, leading to a 50% reduction in trade volume through the canal in early 2024. A spike in transportation costs and insurance premiums further strained global supply chains, resulting in delays and increased freight rates. The conflicts also affected oil volumes transiting the canal, pushing Brent crude prices higher and leading to a marked decline in global shipping capacity.

Global Economic Ramifications

The conflicts around the Suez Canal and the resulting shipping disruptions have far-reaching economic implications, particularly for businesses relying on timely deliveries. Many companies were unable to meet production schedules, which could lead to inflationary pressures in affected economies. Additionally, the spike in marine insurance costs has made using the canal prohibitively expensive for many shippers, resulting in increased reliance on longer routes like the Cape of Good Hope, which yield higher emissions and environmental costs.

The Way Forward: Ensuring Canal Security

Addressing the security vulnerabilities of the Suez Canal is fundamentally an international concern demanding a coordinated approach to ensure maritime safety. A strategic priority should be fostering collaboration among regional and international naval forces to establish protective measures around the Red Sea and beyond. Concepts such as multinational maritime patrols and intelligence-sharing systems could help mitigate risks.

Investments in the canal’s infrastructure, along with technological advancements for surveillance and security, will be crucial. Increasing the capacity to handle larger vessels and establishing advanced communication systems can fortify maritime safety measures.

Conclusion

The Suez Canal’s health is intrinsically linked to global trade stability. Ongoing conflicts in the surrounding regions highlight the canal’s vulnerability, reinforcing the necessity of maintaining its operational integrity through enhanced security and proactive diplomatic efforts. Policymakers and industry stakeholders must realign their strategies to bolster both the canal’s resilience and the broader supply chain systems it supports, ensuring this vital trade artery remains open and secure.",https://cdn-kdmmj.nitrocdn.com/rMIbIrPSYFfiGCokvtkImuATKIjcDThC/assets/images/optimized/rev-41bbbe8/maritimefairtrade.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/cropped-maritime-fairtrade-favicon-1-32x32.png,N,,2025-11-22 20:56:09.099215

Meeting for the first time since the adjournment of the IMO’s MEPC ES meeting in October, INTERTANKO’s Council has reinforced the Association’s commitment to a single global regulatory framework that includes certainty on the use of transitional pathways to meet the IMO’s greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction targets.

INTERTANKO’s Deputy Director, Environment Emma Scheiris said: “This decision is a testament to the Members’ continued commitment and alignment on driving decarbonisation forward, notwithstanding the different pathways used to achieve their emission reduction goals.”

Managing Director, Tim Wilkins added: “INTERTANKO has been consistent in its approach to achieving a global solution through the IMO to meet the 2023 IMO GHG reduction targets, while respecting the ‘Polluter Pays’ principle. The Association has also been clear that to achieve these targets, the full spectrum of transitional pathways must be supported by the regulatory framework, ranging from energy-saving devices and wind-assisted propulsion to alternative fuels such as LNG and sustainable biofuels, and net-zero technologies such as shore power and carbon capture.”

Members voiced their support for INTERTANKO to continue its active role in contributing to the IMO’s draft guidelines and working collaboratively with all stakeholders to validate the transitional pathways. The validity of these pathways has already been assessed by many INTERTANKO Member companies, with evidence emerging that they can form the basis for meeting the reduction targets beyond 2040 and up to 2050. The consolidated data and information support the environmental and business case for using transitional pathways to meet the IMO’s GHG reduction targets. This should form the basis of discussions on the current trajectories and the agreement of a simple and practical legislative framework.

It is important now to gather evidence on the various measures available to reduce GHG emissions from ships. INTERTANKO will form a working group of Member companies to validate these transitional pathways with practical, real-world experience. Recognising that any information gathered must be supplemented with data on the use and supply of certain measures from outside the Association’s membership, the group has been tasked to collaborate with experts and interested parties.

“Success hinges on timing. Evidence supporting transitional pathways must be presented to IMO early enough to influence and shape a global solution,” said Wilkins. “Validating the transitional pathways with real-world data and analysis should provide regulators with the confidence to incorporate these pathways into the global framework and provide the certainty and confidence in the regulatory process that the industry requires.”",https://allaboutshipping.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/INTERTANKO-MD-Tim-Wilkins-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-22 09:56:35.549001

With IMO targeting a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2030 and net zero by 2050, KBB engineering director, Silvio Risse, sees innovation as the key to stay ahead of the regulatory curve.

“We see ourselves as a turbocharger (TC) supplier for engines of today and tomorrow, which need efficient and smart turbocharging systems to achieve future targets,” said Mr Risse.

The shift to low- and zero-carbon fuels, including LNG, methanol, ammonia, and biofuels, driven by international and regional regulations, poses technical and design challenges due to their unique combustion profiles.

For example, methanol’s lower calorific value (20 MJ/kg vs. diesel’s 42 MJ/kg) and higher evaporation enthalpy (1110 kJ/kg vs. 260 kJ/kg) require increased boost pressure for cylinder filling in port-fuel injection systems.

Conversely, ammonia’s high ignition energy (8 MJ vs. diesel’s 0.23 MJ) and low flame velocity (0.067 m/s vs. ~0.8 m/s) benefit from higher compression ratios and reduced boost at full load [0]. KBB’s ST27-EP series (2017) achieves pressure ratios up to 6:1, with enhanced compressor maps and variable inlet guide vanes boosting thermal efficiency by up to 12%.

In 2024, KBB introduced models using titanium alloys for corrosion resistance and advanced cooling for biofuel heat management. “Each engine OEM has its own philosophy and strategy for achieving net-zero targets,” he said. He noted a high degree of flexibility in the company’s portfolio enables the best fit for specific, differentiated applications. The K2B series, including the LPR6 low-pressure stage for two-stage charging, supports varied pressure ratios and wide compressor curves for partial and full loads.

Decarbonisation is driving KBB’s focus on efficiency and power density. “There is a need for greater flexibility for different pressure ratios, single-stage, two-stage, high efficiencies with flexibility for specs for partial and full-load optimisation, wide compressor characteristic curves, etc,” he said. Two-stage systems offer higher efficiency for high-load applications, though they require more space and cost. Using computational fluid dynamics and finite element analysis, KBB achieves pressure ratios exceeding 5:1, reducing fuel use in marine gensets and propulsion.

“Two-stage systems offer higher efficiency for high-load applications”

Mr Risse said: “The optimal thermodynamic adaptation of the TC to the application-specific load profile of the engine is becoming increasingly important. In many cases, this means greater partial load optimisation, especially for auxiliary engines.” Collaboration with engine and exhaust aftertreatment system (EATS) experts yields synergies, said Mr Risse. For example, through improved exhaust pipes and specification adjustments, KBB’s turbochargers enable seamless diesel-gas switching in dual-fuel engines, aligning with IMO’s Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII) requirements.

And compatibility with fuels like HFO, biodiesel, LNG, methanol, and ammonia require rigorous testing.

“Testing and continuous improvement of all affected TC components with every possible fuel in terms of material and thermodynamic behaviour is critical,” he said. Methanol and ammonia’s corrosive nature threatens components like copper and aluminium alloys. KBB’s bearings resist methanol-contaminated oil at 80°C, minimising corrosion.",https://dvzpv6x5302g1.cloudfront.net/AcuCustom/Sitename/DAM/184/LPR6_source_KBBwebzhgf1_Main.png,N,,2025-11-21 18:57:22.863918

By 2025, the European Union’s Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) is projected to add over $6 billion to global shipping costs. By the end of the decade, a combination of regional and global price mechanisms could escalate this figure to over $50 billion annually, as estimated by Siglar Carbon, a shipping emissions analytics firm.

This financial burden reflects overlapping initiatives such as the EU ETS, the UK’s emissions trading scheme, FuelEU Maritime, and the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) forthcoming Greenhouse Gas Fuel Intensity (GFI) measure, which is scheduled to be implemented in 2028. Siglar suggests that if these schemes operate together and more countries adopt similar local taxes, shipping’s total annual carbon costs could approach $100 billion by 2030.

According to LSEG Research, European carbon prices may surge to $150 per tonne of CO₂ by 2030, further increasing the financial pressure on operators reliant on traditional fuels. Siglar analysts note that when carbon is priced, it significantly alters various dimensions of shipping operations—from chartering practices to financing. Emissions now carry a measurable commercial value affecting every voyage.

The IMO’s GFI will add a global carbon regulation across international shipping. When implemented, it could create compliance costs amounting to $22 billion in its initial years, rising potentially to $33 billion shortly thereafter. There remains uncertainty among regulators and industry stakeholders about whether the IMO’s framework will replace or coexist with regional schemes. If it merely adds another layer to existing regulations, the shipping sector may confront a fragmented, complex carbon regime that could disadvantage certain trades more than others.

For shipowners and operators, carbon pricing has transcended its role as an environmental metric; it has become a critical commercial variable that influences time charter equivalent (TCE) returns, voyage planning, and contract negotiations. Additionally, financial institutions and insurers are beginning to view carbon exposure as an emergent category of operational and credit risk. This new risk component must be scrutinized and priced with the same rigor applied to freight volatility and fuel costs, signaling a fundamental shift in how the shipping industry manages its economic and environmental responsibilities.",https://cdn-kdmmj.nitrocdn.com/rMIbIrPSYFfiGCokvtkImuATKIjcDThC/assets/images/optimized/rev-41bbbe8/maritimefairtrade.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/cropped-maritime-fairtrade-favicon-1-32x32.png,N,,2025-11-21 04:56:08.928087

Regular maintenance and monitoring are crucial to prevent equipment failures and ensure the integrity of the capture and storage systems.","The Global Centre for Maritime Decarbonisation (GCMD), AIM Horizon Investments and their partners on Thursday (20 November) announced the successful closing of the Fund for Energy Efficiency Technologies (FEET), securing total commitments of up to USD 35M, exceeding its initial target.

As the world’s first fund for vessel retrofits leveraging a pay-as-you-save repayment mechanism, FEET directly addresses the long-standing financial barriers hindering the sector’s uptake of vessel retrofits.

This fund has drawn strong interest from across the maritime value chain, including equipment manufacturers, shipowners, and investors. GCMD provides catalytic equity and is FEET’s appointed decarbonisation advisor.

FEET is managed by AIM Horizon Investments. Formerly known as FPG AIM Capital, AIM Horizon Investments is a Singapore-based fund manager specialising in maritime and aviation funds for institutional and accredited investors.

Shareholders of AIM Horizon Investments hold the fund’s commercial equity position, while the Development Bank of Japan Inc. (DBJ) holds the preferred equity position. DBS Bank and ING (which acted as Coordinating Bank) have in principle agreed to provide senior debt financing.

Improving energy efficiency remains one of the most effective strategies to reduce emissions and fuel costs. Energy Efficiency Technologies (EETs), such as wind-assisted propulsion systems (WAPS) and air lubrication systems (ALS), can deliver immediate fuel savings, assisting shipowners to stay competitive amid tightening regional carbon regulations. However, even with a retrofit market valued at over USD 20B, uncertainties around EET performance and access to financing continue to limit uptake.

A primary difficulty restricting adoption is the inherently variable fuel savings from EET retrofits, which depend on operational and environmental factors, such as routing and weather conditions. The lack of standardised methodologies to accurately measure fuel savings further challenges uptake.

This uncertainty has made the return on investment period difficult to predict and has exacerbated the split-incentive issue, where shipowners are expected to invest in retrofits whereas charterers realise savings.

A pay-as-you-save repayment mechanism addresses payback uncertainty with EETs by directly linking repayment to quantified and verified fuel and regulatory savings. Deploying this mechanism requires robust data collection and analysis to isolate the retrofit’s contribution to overall fuel savings.

To this end, GCMD has undertaken EET performance pilots, equipping vessels with additional sensors to acquire high-precision, high-resolution data and applying rigorous data analytics to quantify fuel savings with statistical confidence. As more data is collected across diverse operating and environmental conditions, these datasets can be used to model and predict savings under varying scenarios.

FEET is designed to scale beyond this initial closing, recognising the vast market size and shipping sector’s pressing decarbonisation needs. GCMD and AIM Horizon Investments are targeting to scale the fund to USD 500 million by 2030, capable of supporting around 200 ships.

Professor Lynn Loo, CEO, GCMD, said, “Bringing FEET to life has taken persistence and a willingness from everyone involved to step into the unknown. There was no playbook; our teams were learning as we went. This is exactly the kind of collaborative, problem-solving mindset needed to move the needle on maritime decarbonisation.”

“My hope is that FEET will accelerate the uptake of shipboard energy efficiency solutions and help unlock the scale of action needed to turn the industry’s decarbonisation ambition into tangible progress.”

The Maritime Technologies Forum (MTF) on Friday (14 November) announced the publication of guidelines for conducting qualitative risk assessments for alternative-fuelled ships: HAZID and HAZOP.

The use of alternative fuels will be key to addressing the ‘2023 IMO Strategy on Reduction of GHG Emissions from Ships.’

“While IMO has developed guidelines for design and operation of ships capable of using them, the Alternative Design and Approval process is required for most alternative fuels until mandatory regulations are in place,” MTF said in a statement.

“And this dictates using qualitative risk assessment to document an equivalent level of safety compared with a vessel designed to operate with conventional fuels.”

Existing guidelines, such as MSC.1/Circ.1455 and IACS Rec. 146, remain valuable references to the general process for handling alternative design, independent of technology. With the industry’s expanding adoption of alternative fuels and lessons learned from recent projects, MTF considered that there is a need to make supplement to these documents to cover a wider range of fuels and technologies.

The new MTF report provides guidelines for conducting qualitative risk assessments as a core component of the approval process for alternative-fuelled ships. This addresses both HAZID and HAZOP studies, detailing qualification requirements for involved personnel and outlining the procedural steps involved.

The guidelines also specify required input documents, reporting requirements and risk criteria. The guidelines support the identification of potential hazardous events and the development of preventive and mitigative safeguards to manage risks associated with the use of alternative fuels.

The new guidelines were presented at the MTF Seminar on Safe Maritime Decarbonisation held during Europort on 6 November 2025.

With the expected increase in alternative fuelled vessels, both newbuilds and retrofits, panel discussions with industry leaders focused on the relevance of the guidelines and their effective implementation to ensure consistent outcomes providing transparency and trust to the industry stakeholders.

John McDonald, ABS President and Chief Operating Officer, said: “As the industry scales up the use of new fuels, it’s essential to establish consistent and rigorous approaches to HAZIDs and HAZOPs. A unified framework is critical for maintaining safety equivalence as the industry adopts alternative fuel technologies.”

Alf Tore Sørheim, acting Director General, Norwegian Maritime Authority, said: “Consistency across methodologies will also help Administrations take decisions with more confidence. These guidelines are an important contribution, supporting Administrations and industry stakeholders in demonstrating safety for novel fuel systems through an alternative design process, in a more consistent and predictable manner.”

In a large-scale programme involving 50 different shipowners, A.P. Moller – Maersk (Maersk) on Thursday (2 October) said it is – in close collaboration with the owners – retrofitting around 200 vessels in its time-chartered fleet.

The main aim of the programme is to reduce the slot cost by improving fuel efficiency and cargo-carrying capacity leading to a decrease in both cost and greenhouse gas emissions.

Maersk has set the target of a 35% absolute reduction in its scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to the 2022 baseline year.

In total, Maersk and time-charter partners have executed more than 1,500 individual projects across 200 vessels with 50 shipowners, and an additional 1,000 projects are in the process of execution scheduled to be finalised by 2027. The investment cost for these solutions is split between Maersk and the vessel owners.

Given the scale of the project, it spans very different vessels in terms of size and configurations, also meaning that the retrofit tools being used vary.

Of the around 200 vessels being retrofitted, a common and significant change to the vessel configuration is the replacement of the propeller or bulbous bow. The integration of an optimally designed bulbous bow reshapes water flow around the hull to reduce drag and enhance hydrodynamic efficiency – ultimately lowering fuel consumption. Alongside this, the replacement of propellers combined with Pre-Swirl Devices plays a crucial role in maximising thrust while minimising energy loss.

Other retrofit solutions such as auxiliary engine waste heat recovery systems allow steam production from auxiliary engine heat, reducing the reliance on fuel-oil-fired boilers. Similarly, the installation of shaft generator systems cuts down auxiliary engine usage, contributing to significant fuel savings.

Cargo-carrying capacity is also being enhanced through a range of structural and technical improvements: elevating the wheelhouse to improve line of sight and increase intake, raising the lashing bridges, strengthening the vessel’s deadweight capacity for deeper drafts, and upgrading both lashing systems and loading computer functionalities.

Ahmed Hassan, Head of Asset Strategy and Strategic Partnerships at Maersk, said: “Our medium- and long-term chartered fleet makes up a significant proportion of our operations as well as of our total fuel consumption. By working closely with our partners, we aim to implement solutions that not only reduce emissions but also enhance the overall competitiveness of our fleet.”

“While fuel transition is needed to reach our long-term goal of net-zero emissions by 2040, investments in existing fleet efficiency enhancement technologies is a powerful tool to gain significant emissions reductions in the short term. Consequently, this strong emphasis on efficiency measures can deliver tangible progress towards our 2030 goal. That goes for owned as well as chartered vessels.”

As the maritime industry shifts towards low-GHG fuels, ensuring safety during this transition is paramount. This article by classification society DNV highlights the critical measures and considerations necessary for a safe and effective switch to low-carbon fuels and technologies:

Orderbooks are increasingly filled with LNG and methanol fuelled vessels as well as first ammonia ones, as shipowners respond to current emissions regulations and aim to lower carbon intensity in the near term. However, with the IMO targeting net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, both LNG and methanol derived from fossil sources are expected to serve primarily as transitional fuels, requiring a further shift to low or zero GHG alternatives.

Preparing for future fuel switches and their risks

To support this transition, it is essential that considerations for future fuel flexibility are embedded from the design and newbuilding phase. This includes ensuring sufficient space and structural integration for alternative fuel systems, selecting materials compatible with a range of fuels to the extent possible, and designing fuel storage and supply systems that can be retrofitted with minimal disruption. Conducting high-level risk assessments early in the design phase can be an effective strategy to avoid potentially costly design changes later, depending on the extent of re-arrangement required.

Risk mitigation measures for liquefied gases such as hydrogen and ammonia typically include physical barriers between fuel storage, processing, and pumping equipment, and, to the extent possible, maintaining a distance from crew accommodation and workspaces. Detection systems for hazards such as gas leakages and fire are crucial safeguards to implement in relevant locations, enabling early warnings and the initiation of mitigating measures in case of occurrence. A practical and appropriate level of personal protective equipment (PPE) should be mandatory in hazardous areas.

Biofuels: Immediate alternatives with specific risks

From a safety and design perspective, enabling a future switch from conventional fossil fuels to biofuel involves practical and operational risks that need to be addressed to ensure compatibility of fuel systems with varying purity levels or slight differences in properties resulting from various production processes. Certain biofuels have a shorter shelf life compared to conventional marine fuels, which necessitates careful storage and handling considerations. For some biofuels there may be a need for additional training of crew with regard to handling.

Switching safely from LNG

While LNG addresses today’s challenges, the successful adoption of next-generation fuels depends on proactive planning and a design approach that anticipates both safety and regulatory demands. As the industry looks towards fuels such as ammonia, hydrogen, and green methanol, safety must remain a top priority due to their unique risk profiles – ammonia’s toxicity, hydrogen’s flammability and dispersion behaviour as well as its properties in both liquefied and compressed state, and methanol’s low flash point and near-invisible flame. Hydrogen is prone to leakage and can cause severe explosions when escaping. When stored in liquid form at ultra low temperature of -253°C, it requires sophisticated vacuum-insulated pressure tanks that must meet even stricter requirements than LNG tanks. Interaction of liquefied hydrogen with air or other gases harbours additional safety risks that must be considered in the design of storage and processing systems. As an alternative to liquid storage, hydrogen may be stored in compressed form at very high pressure; here again, the containment system must meet strict requirements to reduce the likelihood of leakage.

Liquefied ammonia leakages may damage ship structures due to low-temperature embrittlement, likewise requiring suitable material choices for tanks, processing systems and their surroundings. Ammonia is also highly corrosive to certain types of commonly used construction materials, which has to be accounted for in material selection. The focus of the ship design should be on minimizing and mitigating ammonia releases.

Ensuring safe and prepared fuel transitions

Comprehensive risk assessments should be initiated early to guide technical decisions and ensure safe operations. These may include qualitative assessments like Hazard Identification (HAZID), Hazard and Operability studies (HAZOP), Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA), as well as quantitative studies like Quantitative Risk Assessment (QRA), Gas Dispersion Analysis (GDA) or Explosion Risk Analysis (ERA). It is also imperative that the organizations deciding to utilize alternative fuels evolve in parallel with the technical development, ensuring that aspects concerning crew training, operational procedures, and emergency preparedness all are ready to take on the transition to new fuels.

Switching from methanol

Methanol offers a relatively flexible platform for future fuel transition because it does not require cryogenic storage and can be handled with simpler infrastructure compared to LNG or hydrogen. Ships designed for conventional methanol from fossil sources can, with minimal technical modification, switch to green or blue methanol.

While retrofitting for green or blue methanol would not typically require major structural or system changes, continued compliance with evolving safety standards, emissions reporting, and certification frameworks must be factored in during the design phase.

Looking beyond methanol, a switch to even lower-emission fuels such as ammonia or hydrogen is technically more complex and would generally require significant redesigning of fuel storage, supply systems, and safety measures. These fuels come with different physical properties and risk profiles, demanding tailored containment, ventilation, and fire suppression systems.

Available interim guidelines for ships using alternative fuels (methanol, ammonia and hydrogen (draft)) are all based on the safety principles of the IGF code (International Code of Safety for Ship Using Gases or Other Low-flashpoint Fuels) as a starting point. Until comprehensive statutory regulations are in place, an alternative design assessment for any alternative fuel project is essential. The IMO’s risk-based alternative design (ADA) process (MSC.1/Circ.1455) provides a basis for individual approvals.

Safe installation of onboard carbon capture and storage (OCCS)

Carbon dioxide (CO2) captured from the exhaust gas stream using chemical solvents is purified and compressed for onboard storage. While CO2 is classified as a dangerous good by the IMDG Code and has recently been classified as toxic by IMO, its risks can be effectively managed with proper safety measures. CO2 displaces oxygen in the air, posing a risk of asphyxiation or intoxication, which must be mitigated through adequate ventilation and monitoring systems. The solvents and refrigerants used in the liquefaction and storage of compressed CO2 also require careful handling. However, with relevant training, PPE and safety protocols, these risks can be minimized.

The installation of onboard carbon capture systems must adhere to strict guidelines covering exhaust pre-treatment, absorption processes, liquefaction, storage, and transfer systems. Regular maintenance and monitoring are crucial to prevent equipment failures and ensure the integrity of the capture and storage systems. Comprehensive crew training on the operation and emergency procedures related to OCC systems is essential to enhance safety and preparedness. These measures, combined with continuous regulatory updates and adherence to international safety standards, are vital for the successful deployment of onboard carbon capture technologies.

IMO plans to incorporate the application of onboard carbon capture in the IMO Lifecycle Assessment (LCA) Guidelines. DNV has published guidelines for the safe installation of onboard carbon capture, as well as comprehensive storage and classification rules, and offers its OCCS and OCCS Ready class notations. Flag state administrations have the final say on accepting these guidelines and may impose additional requirements for safe implementation on board.

Despite over a decade of scientific analysis and discussions at the International Maritime Organization (IMO), black carbon emissions from Arctic shipping remain unregulated, with only non-binding guidance in place.","Norway has a unique opportunity to stamp its influence on the clean up of Arctic shipping, ahead of an upcoming International Maritime Organization meeting in February 2026 in London that will set rules on what fuels can be used in the immediate future by shipping in the Arctic, according to non-profit organisations Bellona and the Clean Arctic Alliance.

The momentum for this important decision is building: the Nordic Council of Ministers has just made a recommendation for the Nordic governments to work towards the recognition of polar fuels by the IMO and the MARPOL Convention.

“The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has spent more than a decade on scientific analysis and discussions, but black carbon emissions from Arctic shipping remain unregulated”, said Sigurd Enge, Senior Advisor, Shipping at Bellona, a member of the Clean Arctic Alliance. “Now Arctic nations, including Norway, need to act without further delay, to make cleaner fuels (polar fuels) mandatory for shipping in this unique region that is already being affected by climate change. Norway has a unique opportunity to demonstrate joint leadership on this issue, as it has many vessels operating in polar waters.”

“Black carbon is one of the longest, unresolved issues running at the IMO, and must now be dealt with without delay”, said Dr Sian Prior, Lead Advisor, of the Clean Arctic Alliance. “The next opportunity comes in February 2026, when the IMO’s Sub-Committee on Pollution Prevention and Response will meet (PPR 13) to discuss polar fuels.”

“A strong agreement on polar fuels to set rules which will reduce black carbon emission levels from shipping in the Arctic region is essential”, added Prior. “The deadline for submitting proposals is December 5th – and we want to see a concrete proposal led by Arctic states on polar fuels that will ensure a rapid reduction in Arctic black carbon emissions, ahead of longer-term decarbonisation efforts.”

A regulation requiring the use of polar fuels in the Arctic must set the foundation in MARPOL Annex VI (International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships) for reductions in emissions which reduce the impact of black carbon on the Arctic.

“Norway has been a leader in the past on action to reduce atmospheric emissions from shipping leading to improvements in air quality both domestically in Norway’s fjords, and in the Norwegian Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) through an emission control area for the Norwegian sea which takes effect in 2026”, said Enge. A PPR 13 submission, supported by Norway, would showcase Norwegian leadership, place Norway at the centre of mitigating climate impacts from black carbon emissions from shipping across the whole Arctic, and set the global shipping community on the right pathway”.

A recent report by NGO Pacific Environment lays out the case for why the International Maritime Organization (IMO) should immediately act on reducing black carbon pollution — a climate super-pollutant. On Thin Ice: Why Black Carbon Demands Urgent Action, explores how the expansion of Arctic shipping is causing an increase in the release of black carbon into the air, which then settles on snow and ice, accelerating dangerous melting.

From the report: “one major cause of the accelerated Arctic warming is black carbon, a super-pollutant characterized mainly by its high degree of warming potential as a powerful “short-lived climate forcer” — small particles with a relatively brief lifespan in the atmosphere compared to long- lived greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide (CO2). Cutting black carbon emissions will result in immediate climate benefits that slow warming in the Arctic and improve public health”.

Despite over a decade of scientific analysis and discussions at the International Maritime Organization (IMO), black carbon emissions from Arctic shipping remain unregulated, with only non-binding guidance in place. On thin ice: Why black carbon demands urgent action, presents a clear and urgent call for IMO member states to require vessels operating in and near the Arctic to switch to readily available and cleaner “polar fuels” — such as marine distillates DMA and DMZ or new fuels with comparable black carbon emissions levels — to rapidly cut emissions, protect vulnerable ecosystems and safeguard communities.",https://cyprusshippingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Clean-Arctic-Alliance-Logo-New.jpg,N,,2025-11-20 22:56:30.722852

The world’s oceans, covering over 70% of Earth’s surface, are central to climate regulation. They absorb nearly 25% of anthropogenic CO₂ and over 90% of excess heat, acting as planetary thermostats.

Yet, oceans remain underrepresented in climate policy, receiving less than 1% of global climate finance. As climate risks intensify, sea-level rise, marine heatwaves, and declining fish stocks, global attention has shifted towards ocean-based climate action as a core pillar of sustainable development.

At COP30, a powerful shift in global climate diplomacy emerged as 17 nations, including France, Brazil, Belgium, Canada, Indonesia, and Singapore, joined the Blue NDC Challenge, committing to embed ocean-based climate solutions into their national climate pledges. The move signals recognition of a long-ignored truth: without integrating oceans, the world cannot meet the 1.5°C climate target.

Ocean-Based Climate Action: Why it matters?

Carbon Sequestration

Blue carbon ecosystems, mangroves, seagrass meadows, and salt marshes store carbon at rates far higher than terrestrial forests.

Restoring blue carbon ecosystems can reduce emissions while protecting coastlines.

Heat and Weather Regulation

Oceans absorb the majority of excess heat, moderating the temperature rise.

Ocean warming, however, worsens cyclones, coral bleaching, and biodiversity loss.

Livelihoods and Economy

3 billion people depend on marine and coastal ecosystems for livelihoods.

Fisheries, shipping, and coastal tourism are vulnerable to climate shocks.

Key Components of Ocean-Based Climate Action

Blue Carbon Ecosystems

Conservation and restoration of mangroves, seagrasses, and salt marshes.

These ecosystems provide carbon sinks, storm protection, and biodiversity support.

Countries are now incorporating them into their NDCs.

Sustainable Ocean Food Systems

Climate-resilient fisheries and aquaculture.

Reducing overfishing and shifting to low-carbon aquaculture models.

Offshore Renewable Energy

Oceans hold immense potential for:

Offshore wind energy

Tidal and wave power

Offshore wind alone can contribute significantly to global net-zero pathways.

Decarbonising Global Shipping

Shipping accounts for ~3% of global CO₂ emissions.

IMO is pushing for:

Zero-emission fuels (green hydrogen, ammonia)

Energy-efficient vessels

Carbon intensity reduction measures

Coastal and Marine Conservation

Expanding Marine Protected Areas (MPAs).

Protecting coral reefs, hotspots, and migratory species.

Reducing marine pollution-plastics, chemicals, and oil spills.

Nature-Based Coastal Adaptation

Mangroves and reefs act as natural barriers against erosion and storm surges.

Essential for climate-risk mitigation in vulnerable coastal regions.

What is the Blue NDC Challenge?

The Blue NDC Challenge is a global initiative encouraging countries to include ocean-based mitigation and adaptation strategies in their Paris Agreement commitments.

It addresses the “ocean opportunity gap”, the disconnect between oceans’ climate potential and their limited representation in global climate policy.

Objectives:

Mainstream marine conservation and blue carbon ecosystems into national climate plans

Accelerate offshore renewables and decarbonise shipping

Build coastal resilience through science-based adaptation strategies

Mobilise global finance for marine-based solutions

It is supported by a coalition led by France and Brazil, reflecting their growing leadership in ocean diplomacy.

Key Features of the Initiative

Expanded Global Coalition

Seventeen countries now participate, with new members including:

Belgium

Canada

Indonesia

Singapore

This cross-continental participation strengthens political momentum for ocean-centric climate action.

Creation of an Ocean Taskforce

This taskforce, anchored by France and Brazil-helps countries integrate ocean solutions into their updated 2030 NDCs, especially ahead of the next NDC cycle due in 2025-26.

The “Blue Package”

A coordinated blueprint covering five ocean breakthrough sectors:

Marine Conservation & Restoration

Ocean Food Systems (sustainable fisheries, aquaculture)

Offshore Renewable Energy (wind, tidal, wave)

Shipping Decarbonisation

Coastal & Marine Tourism

This expands climate planning beyond land-based actions.

Mitigation & Adaptation Priority

Oceans could deliver up to 35% of the global emissions reductions needed for the 1.5°C pathway. The initiative emphasises:

mangrove and seagrass restoration,

blue carbon mapping,

coastal ecosystem protection,

clean shipping corridors

early-warning systems for coastal hazards.

Closing the Climate Finance Gap

With less than 1% of global climate finance flowing to ocean-based solutions, the initiative aims to:

create blue finance frameworks,

boost multilateral funding,

mobilise private capital for blue-economy projects, and

support small island and coastal nations vulnerable to sea-level rise.

Blue Carbon Pathways

Blue carbon ecosystems, mangroves, seagrasses, and salt marshes are among the most efficient carbon sinks on Earth. Many participating nations plan to include:

national blue carbon inventories,

carbon credit mechanisms,

marine protected area (MPA) expansion.

International Frameworks

UN Ocean Decade (2021-2030)

High Ambition Coalition for Nature and People

Global Biodiversity Framework (30×30)

These frameworks promote integrated land–sea climate planning.

Challenges

Poor Governance & Fragmented Policy: Land-based ministries, fisheries, and environment departments often work in silos.

Underfunding: Ocean climate finance is <1% of global climate finance, despite huge mitigation potential.

Vulnerability to Climate Extremes: Marine heatwaves, acidification, coral bleaching are escalating.

Technological & Data Gaps: Limited monitoring, data, and modelling of marine ecosystems.

Regulatory Vacuum: High Seas governance is weak; illegal fishing and pollution persist.

India’s Action for Ocean-based climate action

Blue Economy Vision 2030

Sustainable fisheries

Coastal ecosystem protection

Marine spatial planning

Deep ocean missions for climate research

Key Initiatives

Mangrove Initiative for Shoreline Habitats & Tangible Incomes (MISHTI)

Deep Ocean Mission

Sagarmala and coastal resilience measures

Coral reef restoration at the Gulf of Mannar and Lakshadweep

Priority Actions for India

Integrate blue carbon into NDCs

Expand marine protected areas

Develop offshore wind potential (especially Gujarat & Tamil Nadu)

Modernise fishing fleets and reduce overfishing

Use satellite-based monitoring for coastal vulnerability

Way Forward

Integrate Oceans into Climate Policy: Oceans must be part of national mitigation strategies and adaptation plans.

Mobilise Blue Finance: Blended climate finance for Blue carbon restoration, Resilient fisheries, Offshore energy, and Marine conservation

Strengthen Science-Policy Interface: Invest in ocean observation systems, AI-based marine modelling, and climate-risk mapping.

Promote Community-Centred Adaptation: Empower coastal communities through- Climate-resilient livelihoods, Early warning systems, and Ecosystem-based coastal protection

International Cooperation: Joint marine research, surveillance, and climate action across Indo-Pacific nations.

Conclusion

Oceans are no longer peripheral to climate policy; they are central to achieving the 1.5°C goal.

Ocean-based climate action offers powerful pathways for mitigation, adaptation, biodiversity protection, and sustainable livelihoods.

As nations embrace the Blue Economy, the challenge lies in building governance, financing, and technology frameworks that treat the ocean not as an “afterthought,” but as a frontline climate solution.

With the Blue NDC Challenge gaining momentum, the coming decade may finally witness the global mainstreaming of ocean-centric climate governance, an essential step for a resilient, sustainable, and equitable future.",https://www.clearias.com/up/Ocean-Based-Climate-Action-The-Blue-NDC-Challenge.png,N,,2025-11-20 23:56:08.968713

This delay comes after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened sanctions against countries supporting the plan, marking a significant setback for global climate action. The postponement was narrowly decided by a vote of 57-49 and reflects the U.S.’s withdrawal from IMO negotiations earlier in April, where it denounced the carbon tax as a “scam.”

The Philippines is particularly vulnerable to the consequences of this decision, given its substantial reliance on a maritime workforce that includes many Filipino seafarers.

The funds generated were intended to support low-emission ships and assist climate-vulnerable countries like the Philippines in adapting to challenges posed by rising sea levels and extreme weather events.

Shipping is responsible for about 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions. The proposal had garnered backing from numerous countries advocating for climate action, such as the European Union, China, Brazil, and various Pacific Island nations.

By Michael Ethan Gold

The ships that keep global trade afloat face a complex path toward decarbonization. Accounting for roughly 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions, the maritime sector needs a bold strategy to reach net zero – a reality that the International Maritime Organization (IMO) appeared set to acknowledge with the introduction of a carbon pricing framework, the first-ever for the sector. As a vote to approve the framework inched closer last month, climate advocates were cautiously optimistic that it would set a new milestone for the industry.

They did not account for intervention of the climate-denying Trump administration.

Under intense lobbying, pressure and threats from US officials, delegates to the IMO ultimately delayed the carbon price decision by a year. The vote, 57 to 49, followed what diplomats described as an unprecedented campaign of bullying tactics by the Trump administration. According to a New York Times investigation, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio personally called officials in small and developing countries, threatening tariffs, visa bans and sanctions if they supported the measure.

For the maritime community gathered in Barcelona at the Tomorrow.Blue Economy World Congress in early November, the reaction was one of shock and frustration, mixed with determination to press ahead nonetheless.

“It came to a screeching halt,” said Stewart Sarkozy-Banoczy, CEO of the World Ocean Council, whose members include major shipping lines and port authorities. “We’re disappointed, but cities, ports and corporations now have to step in. We’ve seen this before, when the US walked out of the Paris Agreement. Subnational actors kept the work going.”

That subnational momentum, from ports, cities and coastal states, has become a lifeline for maritime climate progress, according to Allyson Browne, CEO of the High Ambition Climate Collective.

“The US is not a monolith,” Browne told Earth.Org in Barcelona. “Individual ports are still pushing ahead. The real work is happening on the ground.”

Browne emphasized, however, that local initiatives cannot replace an international framework. “Shipping is inherently international,” she said. “Without standardized rules and a collective fund for a just and equitable transition, we’ll get a patchwork of policies that makes it harder for developing nations to keep up.”

The tension between global ambition and fractured national politics has long defined shipping’s struggle to decarbonize. London-based IMO is a UN agency founded in 1948 to improve maritime safety after the Titanic disaster. It began addressing climate change in the 2010s, with a set of mandatory measures to improve energy efficiency. While a 2018 commitment to cut shipping’s emissions by at least 50% by 2050 earned plaudits, it was only with the proposed carbon price that the body made concrete moves toward decarbonization.

Under the plan, ships would pay fees as high as $380 per tonne of CO2 equivalent for emissions above set thresholds, with the revenues supporting green innovation and climate adaptation in Small Island and Developing States.

It had the makings of “excellent regulation,” Tristan Smith, Professor at University College London focused on the decarbonization of international shipping, said on the Cleaning Up podcast. Smith called the US pressure campaign “an appalling deployment of pressure” and believes the move reflected a gross distortion of the normal rules of international diplomacy, to the extent that long-held principles became all but meaningless. “It felt apocalyptic,” he said.

Panelists at the Barcelona summit agreed that while the delay was political, it should not derail progress. Hector Calls, Director of Environmental Sustainability and Energy Transition at the Port of Barcelona, called it “disappointing, but not a stop. We’ll keep the course, because clarity and regulation are good for the sector.”

Patrik Benrick, Head of Strategic Development and Innovation at the Port of Gothenburg, echoed Calls’s sentiment: “Better to postpone and keep working than to get a rejection. The risk is that others lose courage, so the EU must stay firm and show leadership.”

Despite the setback, green shipping remains a growing trend. Global shipping giant Maersk sails methanol-powered vessels, and several ports, from Los Angeles to Singapore, are building green corridors to support zero-emission trade routes. Browne said such examples can help build the confidence of member states to resist continued US pressure ahead of next year’s postponed vote. Whether that will be enough to garner majority support remains uncertain, but for many in the maritime community, retreat is not an option.

“We know what our goals are and we need to meet them,” said Sarkozy-Banoczy. “Ports and shipping lines are moving towards greener fuels. I’m hopeful that’s the direction.”
