Ammonia emerges as a promising candidate for future fuel, although its production, transportation, and usage pose challenges. This landscape is evolving rapidly, particularly within the maritime sector, where ammonia is gaining traction.

Ammonia consists of hydrogen and nitrogen, which positions it as a potential zero-carbon fuel. However, the predominant form of ammonia produced today is “grey” ammonia, created through an energy-intensive process reliant on fossil fuels. This traditional production method significantly contributes to carbon emissions, undermining the zero-carbon potential of ammonia.

To mitigate these emissions, the industry is increasingly turning to two lower-carbon production methods. The first is “blue” ammonia, produced by integrating carbon-capture technology into the traditional methods. This approach reduces carbon emissions but still hinges on fossil fuel sources. The second method, known as “green” ammonia, utilizes renewable energy and electrolysis, resulting in minimal to zero carbon emissions. Both blue and green ammonia are classified as low-carbon or decarbonised ammonia.

Although ammonia is being recognized as a viable fuel in the maritime industry, its primary use continues to be in industrial applications, particularly as a fertilizer. It is also finding applications in the production of plastics and synthetic fibers. In the mid to long term, low-carbon ammonia is expected to play a crucial role in power generation.",https://maritimefairtrade.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/cropped-maritime-fairtrade-favicon-1-32x32.png,N,,2025-11-28 10:56:41.302089

More particularly, the discussions of the event addressed how industry and regulators can speed up credible measurement and abatement solutions across global fleets, examining also developments accross the full emissions chain. Delegates discussed the rapid advances in methane measurement and abatement and the need for stronger alignment between innovation and regulation, as well as the right mix between action and accuracy.

With methane recognised as 28 times more potent than CO2 on a 100-year scale and the second most significant GHG emission, participants underscored that methane abatement represents one of the fastest, most impactful climate solutions available to shipping today.

Led by Safetytech Accelerator, established by Lloyd’s Register, MAMII is a coalition of shipping leaders, which aims to reduce the environmental impact of liquefied natural gas (LNG) in shipping while assisting the transition to future fuel solutions.

Upstream transparency is improving through enhanced monitoring tools, enabling more informed LNG sourcing. However, tank-to-wake emissions, where combustion slip remains the dominant contributor, remain the largest challenge. Several engine types have seen 60–70% reductions in methane slip in recent years, supported by the emergence of aftertreatment systems that could scale reductions up to an additional 80–90%.

Furthermore, technology providers demonstrated solutions ranging from catalyst-based aftertreatment and advanced sensor systems to AI-driven emissions analysis and handheld methane leak detection devices for pipelines.

Shell’s Technology Manager, Stephen Brown, confirmed that the company’s in-house methane abatement catalyst system will enter shipboard trials in December. This marks the third MAMII-member aftertreatment technology trial. Early results from all member trials have been positive, and commercial readiness is expected as soon as 2027.

Industry representatives called for clearer, predictable and science-based frameworks that provide certainty for investment. They highlighted the importance of updated default values reflecting technological progress, reliable measurement methodologies, and incentives for early adopters alongside support for retrofitting. Alignment between EU and IMO regulations was seen as essential for global consistency and operational clarity.

The consensus was clear: momentum is building, solutions are advancing rapidly and reducing methane emissions is within reach for the maritime sector. We must now focus on expanding these solutions to global fleets, improving the data supporting our decisions, and guiding the industry confidently towards significant methane reduction.

These policy frameworks are designed to keep African ports aligned with global shipping standards, maintain competitiveness, and reduce long-term operating risks.
The real question is not whether the transformation will occur, but how quickly African ports can prepare and how effectively they can mobilise the support required.","The global maritime industry is steadily moving towards lower emissions, driven by new regulations, evolving fuel technologies and growing pressure from international trade partners.

For many African countries, the pace of this transition is difficult to match, yet the consequences of not adapting may be far greater.

Avoiding or even ignoring the global shift to reshape shipping, is simply not an option, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has stressed.

The IMO’s 2023 greenhouse gas strategy sets a clear target that the shipping industry should reach net-zero emissions around 2050, and signs of this shift are already visible.

These include green methanol-fuelled vessels entering service and major ports in Europe and Asia preparing for ammonia and other alternative fuels. Equipment such as electric cranes, digital yard systems, and shore-power connections is becoming mainstream in developed maritime hubs.

And yet, Africa’s starting point is markedly different.

Many ports still rely on diesel-powered machinery, lack green bunkering infrastructure and operate older vessels on regional routes. This creates a widening gap between global progress and local readiness. Nonetheless, the shift is unavoidable, particularly as compliance with green standards becomes increasingly linked to market access.

Although Africa contributes relatively little to global maritime emissions, it is highly exposed to climate impacts. Rising sea levels and extreme weather events affect coastal infrastructure, ports, and trade corridors.

At the same time, international regulations and market mechanisms, such as Europe’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), are raising the importance of low-carbon transport for exporters.

CBAM will require exporters to account for emissions related to production and transport, which could increase costs for African goods entering Europe if supply chains fail to align with greener standards. Avoiding such penalties will depend partly on cleaner port operations, better monitoring systems, and more efficient logistics.

Financing the transition remains the central challenge. Shifting to low-carbon maritime operations requires long-term investment in infrastructure, energy systems and technology. For developing economies, the scale of financing required is substantial. Gareth Phillips, manager for Climate and Environmental Finance at the African Development Bank (AfDB), has indicated that the bank has become a key player in supporting this transition.

A practical example is found at the Port of Cotonou, where AfDB financed climate-resilience measures to counter rising sea levels, enabling Benin to unlock $18 million in concessional co-financing from the Canadian AfDB Climate Facility. He explained that securing this level of climate-aligned finance would have been difficult without such structured support.

Phillips has also noted that green port projects attract stronger international backing when they offer additional benefits such as community resilience, improved safety, or gender-inclusive development. This approach strengthens funding proposals for African ports but requires careful planning and technical preparation.

Regulation plays a central role in the maritime transition. The IMO’s GHG strategy, reporting obligations, emissions monitoring, and fuel standards, will directly influence port operations and vessel access in the coming years.

James Ng’ang’a, Ports and Maritime Transport expert at AfDB, has stated that the bank is working closely with African governments to align national maritime policy frameworks with these international rules.

In Seychelles, the bank is supporting the Seychelles Ports Authority in preparing the Strategic Investment Plan 2025-2030, ensuring that climate resilience and environmental sustainability are embedded into future port development.

In Namibia, Ng’ang’a has explained that AfDB and the Government of South Korea are assisting in the development of a Green Port Policy, Strategy, and Investment Plan. Implementation is expected to begin in 2026, establishing a structured pathway towards sustainable port operations.

These policy frameworks are designed to keep African ports aligned with global shipping standards, maintain competitiveness, and reduce long-term operating risks.

Africa’s ports will not complete this transition alone. Collaboration with development banks, port authorities, and global shipping companies is essential. AfDB emphasises the importance of coordinated efforts to reduce knowledge gaps, share best practices, and implement practical solutions.

Ng’ang’a has highlighted the example of AfDB’s technical assistance to Transnet in South Africa, which focuses on designing energy-efficiency measures and exploring renewable-energy options for port operations. Such partnerships help African ports enhance performance while preparing for low-carbon requirements expected from international carriers.

The cost of delaying decarbonisation extends beyond environmental impacts. Trade competitiveness is also at risk. If African ports fall behind global standards, shipping lines may shift towards more efficient or greener routes. Exporters may face higher penalties under mechanisms such as CBAM.

Cargo delays, disruptions, and insurance costs could rise if ports are not equipped to manage climate impacts or meet compliance requirements. Phillips has remarked that by adopting cleaner technologies, improving emissions reporting, and integrating climate considerations into port investments, African exporters can avoid unnecessary costs and strengthen their access to international markets.

AfDB is exploring new financing solutions to support long-term maritime sustainability. While the bank does not yet operate a dedicated maritime decarbonisation fund, its activities align with broader development priorities such as resilient infrastructure and capital mobilisation under the President’s ‘Four Cardinal Points’.

Phillips has referred to emerging tools such as the Adaptation Benefits Mechanism, which aims to channel solidarity levies from high-emitting industries into climate-resilience projects. Such tools could support ports in developing infrastructure capable of withstanding rising sea levels, extreme weather, and other climate-related risks.

Across the continent, interest in blue economy strategies is growing. These programmes integrate maritime transport, coastal tourism, fisheries, and renewable marine energy into national development plans. Over time, they could support a broader transition towards greener and more sustainable ocean-based economies.

The global shift towards low-carbon shipping is accelerating. For Africa, the transition is challenging but necessary. Although the continent has not been a major driver of maritime emissions, its ports and exporters must adapt to remain competitive as sustainability standards increasingly influence trade decisions.

Decarbonisation is no longer optional; it is now directly linked to market access, cost efficiency, and long-term resilience. The real question is not whether the transformation will occur, but how quickly African ports can prepare and how effectively they can mobilise the support required.",https://www.freightnews.co.za/files/styles/article_large/public/article/headline/2025-11/6-c.jpg?itok=ecM_vEXf,N,,2025-11-28 09:57:32.586069

Arsenio Dominguez, secretary-general, International Maritime Organization Shipping analysts track between 1,300 and 1,400 vessels operating in the global shadow fleet, and about half are crude oil tankers.
Substandard shipping and ships that do not comply with the IMO regulations should not be operating,” Dominguez said.
Last year, 90 per cent of abandoned seafarers were working on vessels sailing under flags of convenience, the ITF said.
“We maintain statistics, and when patterns emerge, my first step is to start having the conversations” with flag states, said Dominguez.","The head of the United Nations’ maritime agency warned of a disturbing rise in the criminalisation of seafarers, driven by geopolitical tensions and a surge in substandard shipping practices linked to the so-called dark fleet operating outside international norms.

Conflicts across the world that disrupt trade, growing operational costs and regulatory weaknesses have left thousands of seafarers in a 1.8 million person-strong workforce vulnerable.

The International Maritime Organization (IMO) is “very concerned” about worsening conditions for workers, its secretary-general, Arsenio Dominguez, told Context.

Governments must do more to ensure fair treatment and due process for seafarers caught in the growing web of unregulated shipping practices, he said.

“We’re seeing an increase in the abandonment and criminalisation of seafarers,” Dominguez said, pointing to the expansion of shadow fleets, made up of vessels that obscure their ownership and movements to bypass sanctions and oversight, often operating beyond the law.

The dark fleet routinely transports illicit cargo and sanctioned products, such as Iranian and Russian petroleum, flouts regulatory rules and employs unfair working practices, such as forced labour, according to industry experts.

“

We need to pace ourselves to maintain the quality of regulations and ensure they’re actually enforced. And if we’re really serious about attracting the new generations to seafaring, we need to start by actually treating better and keeping the seafarers right now.

Arsenio Dominguez, secretary-general, International Maritime Organization

Shipping analysts track between 1,300 and 1,400 vessels operating in the global shadow fleet, and about half are crude oil tankers.

“These ships are putting seafarers at risk. Substandard shipping and ships that do not comply with the IMO regulations should not be operating,” Dominguez said.

He confirmed that the IMO is now intervening in cases of seafarer abandonment, using the organisation’s diplomatic leverage to pressure governments and flag states to uphold international standards.

“Whenever there’s a case, I reach out to the member states and the flag states, and I work closely with organisations like the ITF to gather information and follow up,” he said, referring to the International Transport Workers’ Federation, which defends seafarers’ rights.

The IMO has recently adopted new guidelines on the treatment of seafarers facing criminal charges for working on board vessels found to be carrying illicit goods, despite having no control over cargo or routes. It is also reviewing its regulations to address seafarer fatigue, violence and harassment at sea.

Yet the IMO’s hands are tied when it comes to enforcement.

“It is not an intention of the IMO to engage or try to trespass into the judicial process of the countries. But I do ask for every single country to treat seafarers rightly, to provide them with due process,” said Dominguez.

Rights crisis

Ship abandonments, in which seafarers are left unpaid, often without food or repatriation, after the owner walks away from a vessel, more than doubled in 2024, according to the ITF.

The consequences can be dire. Crews may be left stranded for months, detained without charge or denied medical care.

Many of these vessels are linked to the sanctioned oil trade. The IMO does not enforce sanctions, but instead seeks basic standards for safety, environmental protection and seafarer welfare.

Owners sometimes register their ships under flags of convenience in countries with lax regulations and tax loopholes, and Dominguez acknowledged that boats flying certain flags routinely appear in databases on abandonment and violations.

Last year, 90 per cent of abandoned seafarers were working on vessels sailing under flags of convenience, the ITF said.

“We maintain statistics, and when patterns emerge, my first step is to start having the conversations” with flag states, said Dominguez.

This softer approach, Dominguez argued, is more sustainable. “Our job is to help build their capacity while ensuring they uphold their obligations.”

Dominguez is working to sign more countries onto the International Labour Organization’s Maritime Labour Convention, which sets minimum standards for seafarers. Several Middle Eastern countries and the United States have yet to ratify the agreement.

The proliferation of small ship-management companies has further complicated the picture. But expanding regulations should avoid creating rules that stifle the industry and cannot be realistically implemented, Dominguez said.

“We need to pace ourselves to maintain the quality of regulations and ensure they’re actually enforced,” he said. “And if we’re really serious about attracting the new generations to seafaring, we need to start by actually treating better and keeping the seafarers right now.”",https://eco-business.imgix.net/ebmedia/fileuploads/49846363501_109a8737ec_4k.jpg?fit=crop&h=801&ixlib=django-1.2.0&q=85&w=1200,N,,2025-11-28 09:58:01.832895

The maritime industry has a fuel problem. Despite a clear change in rhetoric in recent years regarding the need for shipping to decarbonise, 100% of the industry continues to rely, in some form, on fossil-fuel powered ships, whilst coal, oil and gas represent at least 40% of all products transported by global shipping. At the same time, the development of zero-carbon alternative fuel technology continues to be hampered by a myriad of challenges.

Furthermore, recent studies have suggested that despite a renewed focus on decarbonisation, the industry is in fact regressing in terms of its absolute output, with carbon emissions reported to have returned to 2008 levels. The current outlook is bleak, and shipowners’ “wait-and-see” attitude is likely to cost more in the long run, as regulations tighten and current assets fall into obsolescence.

Following the outcome of the recent MEPC meeting in October, the maritime industry must continue to contend with regulatory uncertainty amidst market volatility. Although a prevailing lack of clarity may continue to dominate policy, it certainly doesn’t have to dominate strategy.

The IMO’s delay changes the pace of regulation, not the direction of travel. Decarbonisation remains inevitable, but those who act early will capture the benefits first.

Shipowners have more control than they think. Regulatory pressure at the regional and multinational level has sparked an acceleration in the development of clean technologies in recent years, producing a range of viable options that can secure meaningful GHG reductions, today. From fuel-saving technologies like rotor sails and advanced hull coatings, to hybrid and emulsion fuels, such as MSAR and bioMSAR, there are clear routes to reducing emissions and improving operational efficiency that must be grasped with both hands.

All of the leading alternative fuel technologies that hold the promise of unlocking a net zero future for shipping – whether methanol, ammonia, or even nuclear – are suffering from a shortage of supply, poor and uncertain scale of distribution, as well as ongoing regulatory challenges.

However, there is a wide range of transitional fuels and technologies which, on their own or in combination, offer an immediate means of reducing fuel costs, as well as reducing CO2 and NOx emissions, whilst eliminating harmful particulate matter.

Many of these solutions also drive operational performance. This means that owners and operators are no longer having to forfeit commercial advantage in order to achieve regulatory compliance – unlocking a future in which energy efficiency improvements make real-world business sense.

Let’s be clear: shipowners cannot afford to wait for alternative fuels like ammonia or methanol to be readily available at the scale they are used to. Instead, they must seek to engage with a combination of practical and readily available transition fuels and energy efficiency technologies to reduce operational costs and as well as their GHG footprints.

While frustrating for some, the delay in adopting the new IMO rules may ultimately prove worthwhile if the end result creates a level playing field. The benefits of a consolidated framework are twofold; firstly, it will avoid creating a race to the bottom, as some shipowners may opt to align their operations with the most lenient regulatory regime; and secondly, to address the current compliance complexity by creating a unified regulatory environment that is better suited to support an inherently global business.

Despite the need for the industry to show meaningful emissions reductions by 2030, readily available transition fuels continue to face market challenges. Many of these fuels and technologies are at a critical stage where well-documented trials are necessary for them to be adopted more broadly.

However, class societies, flag states, as well as engine manufacturers risk becoming bottlenecks in this process if all of the industry’s resources are focused exclusively on developing engines that are capable of running on ammonia or methanol. A more balanced approach is needed; one that supports the evaluation and adoption of available fuels or technologies capable of advancing decarbonisation now, rather than later.",https://splash247.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/OW-Bunker-Dynamic-Oil-Trading.jpg,N,,2025-11-28 09:58:06.223029

The global maritime industry is moving steadily towards lower emissions, driven by new regulations, shifting fuel technologies, and rising pressure from international trade partners. For many African countries, the pace of this transition is challenging, but the consequences of not adapting may be far greater.

A global shift that will reshape shipping

The International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) 2023 greenhouse gas (GHG) strategy sets a clear target: the shipping industry must reach net-zero emissions around 2050. This global direction is already visible. Green methanol-fuelled vessels are entering service, and major ports in Europe and Asia are preparing for ammonia and other alternative fuels. Equipment such as electric cranes, digital yard systems, and shore-power connections are becoming mainstream in developed maritime hubs.

Africa’s starting point is very different. Many ports still depend on diesel-powered machinery, lack green bunkering infrastructure, and operate with older vessels on regional routes. This creates a gap between global progress and local readiness. However, the shift is unavoidable, especially as green compliance becomes linked to market access.

Africa’s exposure and the need for adaptation

Although Africa contributes relatively little to global maritime emissions, it is highly exposed to climate impacts. Rising sea levels and extreme weather events affect coastal infrastructure, ports, and trade corridors. At the same time, international regulations and market mechanisms, such as Europe’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) are increasing the importance of low-carbon transport for exporters.

CBAM, for instance, will require exporters to account for emissions associated with production and transport. This could raise costs for African goods entering Europe if supply chains do not align with greener standards. Avoiding such penalties depends partly on adopting cleaner port operations, better monitoring systems, and more efficient logistics.

Financing the transition: The central challenge

Shifting to low-carbon maritime operations requires long-term investment in infrastructure, energy systems, and technology. For developing economies, the scale of financing needed is significant.

According to Gareth Phillips, Manager for Climate and Environmental Finance at the African Development Bank, the bank has become a central player in supporting this transition. A practical example is the Port of Cotonou, where AfDB financed climate-resilience measures to address rising sea levels. This allowed Benin to unlock USD 18 million in concessional co-financing from the Canadian AfDB Climate Facility. Without such structured support, securing this level of climate-aligned financing would have been difficult.

Phillips explains that green port projects attract stronger international backing when they demonstrate additional benefits such as community resilience, improved safety, or gender-inclusive development. This approach helps African ports build stronger cases for funding but requires careful planning and technical preparation.

Aligning policies with global standards

Regulation is central to the maritime transition. The IMO’s GHG Strategy, reporting requirements, emissions monitoring, and fuel standards will directly influence port operations and vessel access in the coming years.

James Ng’ang’a, Ports and Maritime Transport Expert at AfDB, says the bank is working closely with African governments to align national maritime policies with these international rules. In Seychelles, the bank is supporting the Seychelles Ports Authority in preparing the Strategic Investment Plan 2025–2030, ensuring that climate resilience and environmental sustainability are included in future port development.

In Namibia, Ng’ang’a notes that AfDB and the Government of South Korea are helping develop a Green Port Policy, Strategy, and Investment Plan. Implementation is expected to begin in 2026, setting a structured pathway for sustainable port operations.

These policy frameworks aim to ensure that African ports stay connected to global shipping standards, protect competitiveness, and reduce long-term operating risks.

Working with strategic partners

Africa’s ports will not transition alone. Collaboration with development banks, port authorities, and global shipping companies is essential. AfDB emphasises the importance of coordinated efforts to reduce knowledge gaps, share best practices, and implement practical solutions.

Ng’ang’a highlights one such example: AfDB’s technical assistance to Transnet in South Africa to design energy-efficiency measures and develop renewable-energy options for port operations. These partnerships allow African ports to improve performance while preparing for low-carbon requirements expected from international carriers.

Why inaction could be costly

The cost of delaying decarbonisation is not limited to environmental risks. Trade competitiveness is also at stake. If African ports fall behind global standards, shipping lines may choose more efficient or greener routes. Exporters may face higher penalties under mechanisms like CBAM. Cargo delays, disruptions, and insurance costs could rise if ports are not equipped to handle climate impacts or meet compliance requirements.

Phillips notes that by adopting cleaner technologies, improving emissions reporting, and integrating climate considerations into port investments, African exporters can avoid unnecessary costs and strengthen access to international markets.

Building the green and blue economy

AfDB is exploring new financing solutions to support long-term maritime sustainability. While the bank does not yet have a dedicated maritime decarbonisation fund, its activities align with broader development priorities such as resilient infrastructure and capital mobilisation under the President’s “Four Cardinal Points”.

Phillips points to emerging tools such as the Adaptation Benefits Mechanism, which aims to channel solidarity levies from high-emitting industries into climate resilience projects. Such tools could support ports in building infrastructure that withstands sea-level rise, extreme weather, and other climate-related risks.

Across the continent, interest in blue economy strategies is growing. These programmes integrate maritime transport, coastal tourism, fisheries, and renewable marine energy into national development plans. Over time, such strategies could support a wider transition to greener and more sustainable ocean economies.

Preparing for a new maritime era

The global shift towards low-carbon shipping is accelerating. For Africa, the transition is complex but necessary. While the continent did not drive the rise in maritime emissions, its ports and exporters must adapt to remain competitive in a world where sustainability standards influence trade decisions.

Decarbonisation is no longer optional; it is now linked to market access, cost efficiency, and long-term resilience. The question ahead is not whether the transformation will happen, but how fast African ports can prepare, and how effectively they can mobilise the needed support.

Decarbonizing the Shipping Industry has become a top priority as international pressure mounts to address climate change. The Japanese government and private sector are spearheading innovative strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from ships, aiming to transform the sector into a model of sustainability.

National Commitment to Green Shipping

Japan’s Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) has outlined a comprehensive roadmap for achieving net-zero emissions in shipping by 2050. This vision aligns with the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) global targets and reflects Japan’s commitment to environmental stewardship. The government is actively promoting research and development in alternative fuels, including hydrogen and ammonia, which produce no carbon emissions when used as ship propulsion energy sources.

Technological Innovations

Japanese shipbuilders and maritime companies are investing heavily in next-generation vessel technologies. Key projects include the development of hydrogen-powered ships, ammonia-fueled engines, and advanced battery systems for short-distance vessels. Leading firms such as Mitsubishi Shipbuilding and NYK Line are collaborating on pilot projects to test these technologies in real-world conditions. These efforts are supported by government subsidies and public-private partnerships, accelerating the pace of innovation.

Strengthening International Collaboration

Japan recognizes that decarbonizing shipping is a global challenge requiring international cooperation. The country is actively participating in IMO negotiations and working with other maritime nations to establish unified standards for low-carbon shipping. Japanese expertise is also being shared through joint ventures and technology transfers, helping developing countries upgrade their fleets and adopt greener practices.

Challenges and Future Outlook

Despite significant progress, Japan faces challenges in scaling up new technologies and ensuring their economic viability. The transition to alternative fuels requires substantial investment in infrastructure, such as bunkering facilities and supply chains. Additionally, global market fluctuations and regulatory uncertainties pose risks to long-term planning. Nevertheless, Japan’s proactive approach, supported by robust policy frameworks and industry collaboration, positions the country as a frontrunner in maritime decarbonization.

As Japan continues to innovate and lead, its initiatives offer valuable lessons for the global shipping industry.

The latest Annual Progress Report on Green Shipping Corridors from the Getting to Zero Coalition and the Global Maritime Forum shows the total number of active initiatives worldwide has risen to 84—up from 59 in 2024.

The fourth edition of the report, titled At a Crossroads, highlights a notable geographic shift. China and India each added four new corridors, while Brazil added two. Chile, Ghana and Kenya also strengthened their presence. According to the authors, these countries are moving early to capture new opportunities in clean fuel production, bunkering infrastructure and green trade flows.

The update comes shortly after the International Maritime Organization postponed adoption of its Net-Zero Framework to at least October 2026—a delay that, the report warns, could create hesitancy among investors and slow momentum.

For the first time, four corridor projects have progressed to the “realisation” stage, meaning work is now underway on vessels, fuel production or port infrastructure. However, many initiatives are still stuck in feasibility, constrained by the high price of alternative fuels and uncertainty around future regulatory incentives.

Sectoral activity remains broadly unchanged from last year, with one exception: a surge in tanker-related corridors, driven mainly by six new ammonia-carrier routes. The report also notes a rise in projects marked “to be determined,” reflecting the influx of fresh announcements that have yet to define vessel types or operational specifics.

The authors urge governments and industry stakeholders to use the window before the IMO finalises its framework to push projects forward rather than pause development. They point to existing national and regional programmes—such as the EU’s Global Gateway, Germany’s H2Global, and Australia’s Hydrogen Headstart—as mechanisms that could help move corridors into advanced stages and secure first-mover leadership.

To sustain progress, the report calls for targeted actions to close the cost gap between green and conventional fuels, prepare for future IMO incentives, strengthen collaboration with cargo owners willing to pay green premiums, and maximise the use of domestic policy tools to support early deployment.

Introduced through the Clydebank Declaration at COP26 in 2021, green corridors have become testbeds for the fuels, technologies and partnerships needed to decarbonise global shipping.

2025 Overview & Update

Whilst progress during 2025 overall has not proceeded as expected, the Company closes the year in a stronger position, with a clearer path towards commercialisation and the resources in place to achieve this. During the year the Company advanced preparations for the MSC trial, successfully completed a trial with Sparkle Power in Panama and recognised its first license fee revenues from Valkor.

Following the successful fundraise in January 2025 which raised £6.5m (before expenses), the Company recruited additional resources to enhance delivery capacity, accelerate growth and raise its profile in the marine sector. These included the appointment of Peter Borup as CEO with effect from 1 October 2025 and new additions at board, executive and advisor level.

These decisive appointments have resulted in a strengthened business development pipeline and allowed the Company to open discussions with multiple potential clients and supply partners in parallel.

The Company's position has also been strengthened by ongoing regulatory uncertainty. The IMO MEPC's decision in October 2025 to defer adoption of a mandatory Net-Zero Framework for shipping until October 2026 strengthens the Quadrise value proposition. Our technology offers immediate cost savings, significant emissions reductions, and a pathway to low-cost compliance with future regulations.

Progress in each of the Company's key projects is summarised below.

Marine: Following the signature of the 3-way agreement with MSC & Cargill in November 2024, finalisation of the remaining trial agreements has been slower than expected. This is primarily due to the need at MSC's request to consider post-trial go forward commercial supply and for the agreements to reflect the logistical complexities of the trial. Negotiations are ongoing and proceeding positively, with all parties remaining committed to the trials and working to finalise the agreements as soon as possible.

During 2025, the MAC² trial services agreement was executed. Trial operating permits and a dedicated bunker barge have been secured. Groundworks at MAC² are complete, with the trial equipment ready for shipment to Antwerp upon agreement finalisation. In parallel, discussions are ongoing with refineries with regard to commercial supply from key bunker hubs worldwide.

Following signature of the remaining agreements, installation and commissioning of trial equipment at MAC² will precede fuel production and Proof-of-Concept tests. The bioMSAR™ LONO trial will conclude 6 to 8 months after the 2-month Proof-of-Concept tests of MSAR® and bioMSAR™. During the LONO trial, the parties are aiming to finalise a Commercial Supply Agreement and secure permanent bioMSAR™ bunker supply operations for the marine sector by Cargill from MAC² facilities, contingent on successful trial completion.

Valkor: In September 2025, due to slower than expected production growth at Valkor's Utah operations, Quadrise and Valkor agreed a further addendum to the 2023 Site License and Supply Agreement. This sets out a revised timetable regarding payment to Quadrise of US$1.5m for licensing and equipment fees, quarterly support fees and the deployment of Quadrise equipment to Valkor's site.

Following receipt of an initial US$50k of the US$1m license fee, a further US$0.3m is now due by 31 March 2026, and US$0.65m by 30 June 2026. Quadrise will provide a 600 bpd Multifuel Manufacturing Unit (""MMU"") by 30 June 2026, for which Valkor will pay US$0.2m by 30 September 2026. An additional US$0.3m is payable upon delivery of a full-size 6,000 bpd MMU, in exchange for the 600 bpd MMU. A service charge of US$75k is due quarterly from 1 July 2026 for at least two years, covering engineering, process design, commissioning, site operations, and compliance support.

Valkor have now secured the funding required to progress drilling and site development, with their 500bpd oil sands pilot plant expected to be operational in Q2 2026. Representative oil samples for Quadrise testing are expected in Q1 2026 ahead of the deployment of Quadrise equipment to site and the commencement of marketing activities in the USA.

Americas: In September 2025, Quadrise was pleased to announce the successful completion of proof-of-concept and emissions testing for its MSAR® and bioMSAR™ fuels at the Sparkle Power SA plant in El Giral, Panama. These trials mark the first application of MSAR® and bioMSAR™ on Everllence (formerly MAN Energy Solutions) 4-stroke engines, broadening the commercial potential of the Company's fuels across additional engine types in energy-intensive sectors seeking cost-effective decarbonisation.

Testing has demonstrated improved engine efficiency and significant emissions reductions, and also validated expected performance for commercial deployment. The next steps are for Quadrise and Sparkle to confirm commercial supply arrangements and secure fuel permitting in Panama. In parallel, discussions with potential regional supply partners are underway.

OCP: In Morocco, the proposed 30-day commercial site trial continues to await final OEM approval. Quadrise and OCP are now working to obtain this or select alternative sites, and the trial is expected to commence once plans have been agreed, with the trial equipment on-site at OCP.

bioMSAR™ Development: During the year good progress has been seen on testing new biofuels for bioMSAR™ and bioMSAR™ Zero and the Company has also collaborated with technology companies to explore and unlock new renewable feedstocks. These included:

· Solvolysis: with Vertoro BV and partners

· Fast pyrolysis: with BTG Bioliquids BV and Alder Energy

· Hydrothermal Liquefaction: with Licella Holdings

· Undisclosed others under development

During the year Quadrise commenced the SEASTARS EU Horizon Project, a consortium of 19 partners from 8 countries working together to drive sustainable shipping forwards. The Company is also awaiting approval on other similar EU-funded projects.

Commenting on the update, Peter Borup, Chief Executive Officer of QED, said:

""We obviously would have liked to have more to say about progress of the Company's main projects. However, we have taken advantage of the successful fund raising to significantly increase our experience base and capacity to improve our marine project management and the commercialisation of our unique technology.""

""As a relatively small player dealing with larger and much more complex clients, our focus is now on more aggressive project management, with more assertive timeline management as well as pursuing parallel projects and trials to give ourselves more chances to advance our technology.""

""This is particularly important at a time where the maritime industry needs to select technologies that together can offer cost savings and emissions reductions to meet the requirements of the EU regulations and ultimately the IMO.""

,,2025-11-28 07:00:33+00:00,inkl,Many ships found breaching pollution limits despite tighter controls - inkl,Not Available,,,,,https://www.inkl.com/news/many-ships-found-breaching-pollution-limits-despite-tighter-controls,"In response to this challenge, Prof James Lee from the University of York began measuring air pollution from individual ships.
We would position the FAAM aircraft in the area of operation.
A tighter air pollution zone operates in the Channel and North Sea.
This was largely effective but here two out of 33 ships breached limits.
Our work also showed that ships are a significant source of local air pollution when they are sailing close to shore.","In response to this challenge, Prof James Lee from the University of York began measuring air pollution from individual ships. He said: “We wanted to see how widely the new regulations were being adhered to and then look at the effect on the atmosphere. We flew the FAAM aircraft out from the UK and Portugal to investigate in 2019 and then again in 2021 and 2022.”

The UK’s FAAM aircraft started life as a prototype short-haul airliner for about 100 passengers. Nowadays it carries up to 18 researchers and four tonnes of science equipment.

Dr Dominika Pasternak, one of the researchers on the study, said: “The most difficult part was finding the plume. We would position the FAAM aircraft in the area of operation. A person back at the airport used a ship tracker website and relayed coordinates, heading and visual description over Satcom.

“We often flew just 30 metres over water. With data on wind speed and direction, the speed and heading of the ship, some trigonometry and very skilled flying, we were able to intercept 130 ship plumes.”

In the open ocean, eight ships out of 19 were emitting more sulphur than permitted in 2019. These included a 61,900 tonne container ship and an 86,100 tonne crude oil tanker. Five ships out of 78 exceeded the stricter limits in 2021 and 2022.

A tighter air pollution zone operates in the Channel and North Sea. This was largely effective but here two out of 33 ships breached limits. In one case, a 200,000 tonne container ship was found breaching sulphur limits in the open ocean but had later switched to cleaner fuel when it was sampled nearer land in the Channel and North Sea zone.

Air pollution from burning shipping fuels can be measured further inland – in London for example – and was estimated to have cost the UK £1.5bn in health impacts in 2017.

Lee offered a message to policymakers: “The reduction in sulphur shows that regulations can have an effect. Our work also showed that ships are a significant source of local air pollution when they are sailing close to shore.

“As the road vehicle fleet becomes cleaner, shipping and aviation are likely to become the main source. Consideration should be given to any policy to reduce these.”

The IMO is expected to adopt a new emissions control area for shipping around the western UK and the north-east Atlantic, which will come into force from 2027.",https://images.inkl.com/s3/article/lead_image/22752853/1000.jpg,N,,2025-11-28 09:59:14.599672

“The move of major countries like China, India, and Brazil into green corridors is hugely promising, as these are markets that will determine whether zero-emission shipping scales fast enough to meet global climate goals,” Jesse Fahnestock, director of decarbonisation at the Global Maritime Forum, said.
“But even more importantly, we’re seeing recognition from these countries that green corridors are more than just environmental projects – they are strategic economic infrastructure.
Despite this delay, the report warns that industry and governments should not surrender the next year to a ‘wait and see’ approach.
Utilise emerging national policy and adapt it for new geographies to accelerate change and encourage industry buy-in.","The movement to create green shipping corridors – trade routes designed to demonstrate and scale novel zero-emission fuels, vessels, and technologies – has expanded in numbers and geographic scope, according to a new progress report published today by the Getting to Zero Coalition and the Global Maritime Forum.

This year’s edition, At a Crossroads: Annual Progress Report on Green Shipping Corridors 2025, identifies 25 new green corridor initiatives, expanding the global total to 84 active initiatives. Initiatives have been launched in major developing economies like China, India, Brazil, Chile, Ghana, and Kenya, reflecting the significant economic opportunities that can be seized through the development of zero-emission marine fuels and bunkering capabilities in these regions.

The news comes only a month after discussions to adopt the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) landmark Net-Zero Framework, designed to establish a path for shipping to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, were delayed for at least one year.

“The move of major countries like China, India, and Brazil into green corridors is hugely promising, as these are markets that will determine whether zero-emission shipping scales fast enough to meet global climate goals,” Jesse Fahnestock, director of decarbonisation at the Global Maritime Forum, said. “But even more importantly, we’re seeing recognition from these countries that green corridors are more than just environmental projects – they are strategic economic infrastructure. Countries that move early stand to gain competitive industrial and geopolitical advantages across energy, trade, and technology.”

For the first time since the report’s inception in 2022, four green shipping corridors have now reached the ‘realisation stage’, an important milestone at which the construction and/or operation of vessels, infrastructure, and/or fuel plants takes place. However, the report cautions that many of the 84 initiatives remain stalled by a ‘feasibility wall’ created by the cost gap between conventional and zero-emission fuels – a challenge that the Net-Zero Framework, delayed until at least next October, could help overcome.

Despite this delay, the report warns that industry and governments should not surrender the next year to a ‘wait and see’ approach. Instead, corridors should make use of emerging policies and programmes from national governments, such as the EU’s Global Gateway initiative, H2Global, and Australia’s Hydrogen Headstart programme – something that would unlock progress ahead of a global framework and put participants among the frontrunners to benefit from future IMO incentives.

“We have at least 12 months before the IMO’s Net-Zero Framework is adopted,” Fahnestock said. “That time can either be spent waiting, or used to build projects that create strategic economic advantages, generate learnings that can influence the IMO’s reward mechanism, and put participants first in line for future global rewards. Those who act now will be best positioned to benefit when regulation catches up.”

To best expand and progress green corridors, the report recommends the industry:

Pursue strategies to break inertia and maintain momentum, closing the cost gap and ensuring corridors are advanced enough to qualify for first mover rewards once they’re available.

Capitalise on the opportunity to shape IMO policy, like the reward mechanism, and be well-positioned to benefit from eventual regulation.

Better engage those with ambitious decarbonisation goals that can help scale solutions, particularly cargo owners who may be more willing to pay a premium for cleaner fuels.

The report identifies 25 new green shipping corridor projects — including in China, India, Brazil, Chile, Ghana, and Kenya — bringing the total to 84 initiatives globally. Grouped by development stage, 24 green corridors are at the earliest initiative stage, 16 are in the early stages of exploration, 28 are in the advanced stage of exploration, 12 are in the preparation stage, and four are in the most advanced realisation stage.

The report is the first to categorise projects in the realisation stage, broken down into construction — defined by construction of vessels and/or the building of fuel plants — and operation, where zero-emission shipping routes are in service.

The four green corridors in the realisation stage are Oslo-Rotterdam, Stockholm-Turku, Vaasa-Umea, and the only deep-sea route Australia-East Asia Iron Ore. The Stockholm-Turku and Vaasa-Umeå corridors have both entered operation.

The number of projects in the pre-commercial and commercial preparation stages doubled since last year, meaning barriers to realisation are being removed and actions taken towards realisation of the green corridor.

The report notes a contrasting narrative to the expansion of green corridor numbers Hesitation over the future direction of green corridors has emerged as the result of the ongoing cost gap between traditional and low-emissions fuels, and policy delays reducing future market clarity.

“We have at least 12 months before the IMO’s Net-Zero Framework is adopted,” said Jesse Fahnestock, director of decarbonisation at the Global Maritime Forum. “That time can either be spent waiting, or used to build projects that create strategic economic advantages, generate learnings that can influence the IMO’s reward mechanism, and put participants first in line for future global rewards. Those who act now will be best positioned to benefit when regulation catches up.”

The report identifies the NZF delay at IMO as an opportunity for green corridor stakeholders to proactively engage with the IMO and shape policy, sharing learnings and influencing the shape of future reward mechanisms.

The report also recommends that cargo owners' willingness to pay for e-fuels is better connected to the corridors. Links between corridors and The Zero Emission Maritime Buyers Alliance (ZEMBA) were established in 2024, the report said, but more work can be done to identify those cargo owners willing to pay a premium to reduce indirect emissions in their supply chains.

Relevant national policy instruments are identified in the EU, Australia, and Norway, and all green corridors are advised to replicate or tap into those policies.

“For routes where cost gap-closing policy instruments are not available, the immediate next step is to work towards replicating and adapting existing policy measures in relevant geographies.

It acts as a live test bed for scaling green shipping that can then be replicated on other routes

For the first time, major economies including China, India and Brazil have entered the space, signalling the strategic value of zero-emission shipping for trade, economic growth, and long-term competitiveness.

Jesse Fahnestock, Director of Decarbonisation at the Global Maritime Forum, said: “The move of major countries like China, India and Brazil into green corridors is hugely promising… green corridors are more than just environmental projects – they are strategic economic infrastructure.”

The report arrives one month after the International Maritime Organization delayed adoption of its Net-Zero Framework.

This decision risks slowing progress, as the framework is expected to address the persistent cost gap between conventional fuels and zero-emission alternatives.

However, the report warns against a pause in activity.

These interventions could help corridors reach the ‘realisation stage’, where vessels, infrastructure, and fuel production begin operating.

Fahnestock added: “That time can either be spent waiting, or used to build projects that create strategic economic advantages.”",https://www.energylivenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/shutterstock_2672982023.jpg,N,,2025-11-27 08:56:50.665796

The association’s Council convened this week for the first time since the IMO postponed a decision on its Net-Zero Framework, which would introduce the first global greenhouse gas pricing mechanism for international shipping. The meeting reaffirmed members’ alignment on the need for a unified international system that accommodates a broad range of transitional measures.

Tim Wilkins, Managing Director of INTERTANKO, said: ‘INTERTANKO has been consistent in its approach to achieving a global solution through the IMO to meet the 2023 IMO GHG reduction targets, while respecting the ‘Polluter Pays’ principle.’ He added that the regulatory architecture must support ‘the full spectrum of transitional pathways’. These include energy-saving devices, wind-assisted propulsion, LNG and sustainable biofuels, as well as net zero technologies such as shore power and carbon capture.

Members highlighted that many owners are already testing these measures at scale, generating data that suggests transitional pathways can underpin emissions reductions beyond 2040 and towards 2050. Consolidated findings from these projects have strengthened the environmental and commercial case for a diversified decarbonisation trajectory.

To accelerate evidence gathering, INTERTANKO will establish a working group of member companies tasked with validating the effectiveness of transitional pathways using operational data. The initiative will also involve external experts, recognising that insights on fuel availability, infrastructure and life cycle performance extend beyond the membership.

Emma Scheiris, INTERTANKO’s Deputy Director for Environment, said: ‘This decision is a testament to the Members’ continued commitment and alignment on driving decarbonisation forward, notwithstanding the different pathways used to achieve their emission reduction goals.’

The IMO’s intersessional group continues to develop implementation guidelines for the postponed Net-Zero Framework, and the window for contributing evidence is narrowing. Wilkins cautioned: ‘Success hinges on timing. Evidence supporting transitional pathways must be presented to IMO early enough to influence and shape a global solution. Validating the transitional pathways with real-world data and analysis should provide regulators with the confidence to incorporate these pathways into the global framework and provide the certainty and confidence in the regulatory process that the industry requires.’

The association argues that regulatory certainty is essential for investment in fuels and technologies that will underpin the maritime carbon economy. For tanker owners making long term decisions on fuels, retrofits and vessel design, a unified approach provides clearer investment signals.",https://maritimecarbonintelligence.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/eyJ3IjoxMTAwLCJmIjoid2VicCIsImsiOiI1NmE5NjdiZGI4ZDgzN2IwODQ0YmI1ZWNjMTFkZGM1NCIsImNyb3AiOlsyLDAsMTcyNywxMTUyXSwiciI6MS41LCJvIjoiZ2xvYmFsIn0.png,N,,2025-11-27 18:56:30.473051

The trend comes despite discussions to adopt the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) landmark Net-Zero Framework being delayed for at least one year. This was due to the US and other countries including Saudi Arabia blocking efforts to finalise a new global carbon tax on shipping.

Regardless of the IMO timeline, a new progress report published today (November 27) by the Getting to Zero Coalition and the Global Maritime Forum reveals that 25 new green shipping corridor initiatives have been launched in 2025, bringing the global total to 84 active corridors worldwide.

These corridors are specific maritime routes between two or more ports that are decarbonised. Vessels reaching each location on the route can access low-carbon infrastructure and technologies.

For the first time, initiatives have been launched in major developing economies including China, India, Brazil, Chile, Ghana and Kenya, reflecting the significant economic opportunities emerging from the development of zero-emission marine fuels and bunkering capabilities.

Strategic shift

Jesse Fahnestock, director of decarbonisation at the Global Maritime Forum, said the entry of major economies into green corridors represents a strategic shift following early adoption in Europe.

Fahnestock said: “The move of major countries like China, India and Brazil into green corridors is hugely promising, as these are markets that will determine whether zero-emission shipping scales fast enough to meet global climate goals.

“But even more importantly, we’re seeing recognition from these countries that green corridors are more than just environmental projects – they are strategic economic infrastructure. Countries that move early stand to gain competitive industrial and geopolitical advantages across energy, trade and technology.”

Progress meets challenges

The annual report, At a Crossroads: Annual Progress Report on Green Shipping Corridors 2025, finds that four green shipping corridors have now reached the ‘realisation stage’ for the first time since reporting began in 2022. This milestone sees the construction and operation of vessels, infrastructure and fuel plants taking place.

However, the report cautions that many of the 84 initiatives remain stalled by a ‘feasibility wall’ created by the cost gap between conventional and zero-emission fuels – a challenge the IMO’s delayed Net-Zero Framework could have helped overcome.

Green shipping corridors as a concept gained unprecedented traction at COP26 in Glasgow in 2021, when almost two-dozen signed the Clydebank Declaration committing to establishing at least six corridors by the mid-2020s.

Among those to sign the Declaration were Australia, Belgium, Canada, Chile, Costa Rica, Denmark, Fiji, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Marshall Islands, Morocco, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, the US and the UK.

Warning against ‘wait and see’ approach

Despite the IMO delay, the Global Maritime Forum is warning against surrendering the next 12 months to a ‘wait and see’ mindset. Instead, it urges corridors to capitalise on emerging national policies and programmes such as the EU’s Global Gateway initiative, H2Global and Australia’s Hydrogen Headstart programme.

“We have at least 12 months before the IMO’s Net-Zero Framework is adopted,” Fahnestock said. “That time can either be spent waiting, or used to build projects that create strategic economic advantages, generate learnings that can influence the IMO’s reward mechanism, and put participants first in line for future global rewards. Those who act now will be best positioned to benefit when regulation catches up.”

The report warns that projects failing to progress now could be left at the back of the queue for future IMO incentives, with early movers best placed to benefit once the Net-Zero Framework is finalised.

It also illustrates the challenges of long-term forecasting, and such forecasts’ variability in the face of seemingly small changes in assumptions.

The relative reduction in oil demand by 2050 compared with FPS-2023 (updated in July 2024), which underpinned our previous Climate Vulnerability Signals (Climate.VS) analysis, has shifted from 62% to 33%, but with most of the changes occurring after 2035. The higher-than-previously-expected oil demand is driven by two factors: transportation (about 22 million barrels per day, or 22mmbpd, of additional demand versus FPS-2023) and non-energy use (over 10mmbpd of additional demand), primarily plastics.

Road transportation accounts for three quarters of transportation demand for oil. FPS-2025 incorporates slower electric vehicle (EV) take-up than the previous forecast and assumes new EV sales and EV penetration reaching 90% and 70%, respectively, in 2050 (compared with 100% and 94% in FPS-2023), resulting in higher demand for oil from both light- and heavy-duty vehicles.

The impact of this relatively small change in 2050 demand illustrates the high level of uncertainty involved in any long-term forecast. Further policy changes, as well as technological and economic developments, may significantly alter EV sales and other aspects of energy demand in the future. The variability in the range of oil demand outcomes is illustrated by a potential reduction in 2050 of only 7% under the International Energy Agency (IEA) Stated Policies Scenario, which compares to a reduction of more than three quarters based on the IEA Net Zero Emissions Scenario from 2025 levels of oil demand.

The uncertainty also illustrates the challenge sector participants face in determining appropriate investment in new projects, which is needed to maintain oil production. This uncertainty increases the risk of material over- or under-supply leading to increased price volatility, which in the long term could increase credit risk.

These factors lead Fitch to remain cautious regarding the potential risks posed by the energy transition to oil-related sectors, regardless of short-term policy choices in some parts of the world swinging towards oil producers, and resultant changes in scenarios.",,N,,2025-11-27 08:57:03.395586

The proposed expansion to international voyages would apply to ships already in scope of the UK ETS due to their domestic voyages or emissions in UK ports and would cover the same greenhouse gases.

Including 50% of emissions from international voyages is expected to be a significant driver for decarbonisation. As explained, it will ensure that 100% of emissions are covered on voyages between the UK and the European Economic Area (EEA), through the combined effect of the UK ETS and EU ETS.

The additional 50% coverage on other international routes will further support decarbonisation efforts. Impacts associated with this policy will be analysed as part of the Impact Assessment (IA) to be published alongside the Authority Response to this consultation.

The responses to this consultation will be used to develop final policy decisions regarding the expansion of the UK ETS to include emissions from international maritime voyages.

Potential impacts of UK ETS expansion to international maritime voyages

The Impact Assessment accompanying the main Authority Response on the expansion of the UK ETS to domestic maritime sets out the evidence on the expected impacts of domestic expansion. Benefits include greenhouse gas emissions savings and air quality benefits in the maritime sector, whilst costs include costs to maritime operators of investing in abatement technologies, administrative costs to operators of complying with the scheme, and the cost of buying UK ETS allowances. The proposed expansion of the scheme to UK international maritime voyages is expected to deliver similar impacts on greenhouse gas emissions savings and air quality benefits. However, the precise extent of this is uncertain, in part due to interactions between the UK ETS and EU ETS, and interactions between these schemes and the IMO NZF, which will both be subject to review following adoption of the IMO NZF to account for these interactions.

As the expansion to domestic maritime emissions includes all emissions produced in port domestically, regardless of the voyage, the proposed expansion to international maritime voyages would not bring any new maritime operators into scope. In addition, many operators will also be subject to EU ETS and IMO Data Collection System (DCS) requirements. Therefore, additional administrative costs from expansion to international maritime voyages are expected to be minimal. However, operators conducting both domestic and international voyages will see a greater proportion of their emissions covered by the UK ETS, which may increase their overall abatement and allowance purchasing costs.

Early evidence from the EU ETS expansion to maritime shows that there is limited evidence of route changes to avoid ETS coverage, however, there is some evidence of ships making additional ports of call in the UK to avoid paying full coverage on intra-European journeys. By expanding the UK ETS to cover 50% of international voyage emissions, this would remove the incentive for vessel operators to undertake additional ports of call in the UK, therefore reducing the risk of gaming and carbon leakage, though this could result in lower UK port activity.

Other evidence from the same EU report has shown that the additional costs imposed by the EU ETS on the transportation of goods via maritime are expected to be low, however, maritime operators have begun to implement surcharges to cover and pass-through these costs. The extent to which ETS costs are passed through to the final costs of goods is uncertain, but is expected to be minimal based on existing evidence, which is set out in the Impact Assessment for domestic maritime expansion.

Further evidence on the potential impact of the expansion of the ETS to domestic maritime is explored in the Impact Assessment. This evidence is broadly expected to also apply for the expansion to international maritime voyages. However, there may be some impacts that are of greater relevance to UK – international maritime voyage expansion, for example, impacts on international trade, and risks of modal shift from maritime to modes of transport not covered by the UK ETS.",https://safety4sea.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/shipping-emissions-shutterstock-scaled-e1747999157890.jpg,N,,2025-11-27 08:57:07.158369

Across the panel, the unifying sentiment was that shipping is unusual among global industries: it is actively calling for stronger international regulation.

Though each spoke from a different corner of the maritime landscape, their messages overlapped in ways that underscored the significance of the IMO decision.

Pedersen stressed that the IMO’s long-term climate ambition remains intact. The net-zero target is already woven into the organisation’s adopted strategy and is not expected to be watered down. Instead, he noted that the practical reality of the coming years – economic uncertainty, strained markets and uneven political support – means shipping must concentrate on steps that deliver immediate value. Efficiency measures topped the list, saving fuel, reducing exposure to compliance costs and delivering returns without waiting for regulatory clarity. He also cautioned against a rise in unilateral regional measures, arguing that fragmented rules would undermine global shipping at the moment it most needs stability.

Thiem emphasised the long investment cycles that define the maritime sector. Ships ordered today will still be sailing in 2050, he reminded the audience, and choices about engines, fuel systems and onboard design cannot be deferred. He urged European stakeholders in particular to look ahead rather than rely on legacy approaches, asking whether the solutions of 200 years ago could really guide the industry in the decades to come. The question, he said, is not whether to change but how quickly the sector can align its decisions with the future it wants to serve.

Dahlgaard focused on the work now needed to make the IMO framework operational. The coming year must be used to refine guidelines, strengthen certification pathways and resolve outstanding technical-economic questions. But she also pressed for industry leadership, arguing that climate impacts will not pause for negotiations. Leadership, she said, often depends on those willing to move ahead before consensus fully forms.

Mundt added a government perspective, underscoring that individual action matters alongside regulation. The transition will demand engineering creativity, investment and a willingness to pilot solutions even when the business case is not yet perfect. He spoke of the importance of maintaining a positive, problem-solving mindset, noting how technologies that once appeared marginal can gain momentum quickly when supported by committed early adopters.

Skipper Schwenn closed the panel by emphasising that the delay must not distract from the significance of decisions being taken today. Every choice about engines, fuel readiness and onboard integration will shape the sector’s ability to secure the future energy supply it needs. Without a firm and timely IMO framework, she warned, shipping risks slipping to the back of the global queue for low-carbon molecules, outbid by aviation and road transport, which are more prepared to pay premium prices. She urged the audience to work through industry organisations and directly with governments to demonstrate how much has already been invested and why regulatory certainty is essential for maintaining momentum.

Across the panel, the unifying sentiment was that shipping is unusual among global industries: it is actively calling for stronger international regulation. The IMO’s delay has given the sector a narrow window, not for hesitation, but for alignment.

The fourth edition of the report, At a Crossroads, lifts the worldwide tally to 84 active corridor initiatives—up from 59 a year ago—and shows a marked shift in activity toward China (+4), India (+4), Brazil (+2), Chile (+2), Ghana, and Kenya. The authors said these countries are positioning themselves early to capture the industrial and energy-market advantages tied to new zero-emission fuels and bunkering hubs.

The update landed just weeks after the International Maritime Organization pushed back adoption of its planned Net-Zero Framework until at least October next year, delaying a system intended to help close the cost gap between fossil fuels and cleaner alternatives. The report cautioned that the setback risks fuelling a “wait-and-see” attitude that could stall progress.

“The move of major countries like China, India and Brazil into green corridors is hugely promising,” said Jesse Fahnestock, director of decarbonisation at the Global Maritime Forum. “But these corridors aren’t just climate projects—they’re strategic economic infrastructure. Early movers stand to gain on energy, trade and technology.”

For the first time, four green corridor projects have now reached the “realisation” phase, where vessel construction, fuel production, or port infrastructure buildout is underway. Even so, many initiatives remain stuck at the feasibility stage, where high fuel costs and uncertain policy support continue to slow investment decisions.

Compared with last year’s report, the mix of shipping segments has changed little. The main exception is a jump in tanker activity, driven largely by the addition of six ammonia-carrier corridors. There has also been a notable rise in initiatives listed as “to be determined,” reflecting the wave of newly announced corridors that have yet to finalise key details such as the vessel segment.

The report urged governments and industry to use the next 12 months to advance projects rather than wait for IMO clarity. It highlighted national programmes—including the EU’s Global Gateway, H2Global and Australia’s Hydrogen Headstart—as immediate tools that could move corridors into advanced stages and help secure first-mover status once the IMO finalises its policy.

“We have at least 12 months before the IMO’s Net-Zero Framework is adopted,” Fahnestock said. “That time can either be spent waiting, or used to build projects that create strategic advantages and position participants for future global rewards. Those who act now will be best placed when regulation catches up.”

To maintain momentum, the report recommended that corridor partners push ahead with efforts to shrink the fuel cost gap, ensure readiness for future IMO incentives, engage more actively with cargo owners willing to pay a premium for cleaner transport, and lean on national policy to accelerate early deployments.

Since the concept emerged with the Clydebank Declaration at COP26 in 2021, green corridors have been seen as a proving ground for new fuels and technologies that could set the pace for wider decarbonisation across shipping. The authors noted that their impact extends beyond hardware and investments—many of the biggest shifts are happening behind the scenes through collaboration between ports, shipowners, fuel suppliers and regulators. With the industry approaching key 2030 climate milestones, the report highlighted the next few years will determine whether green corridors transition from pilots to a scaled global network capable of shifting the sector onto a net-zero track.",https://splash247.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Cosco-Green-Methanol-bunkering.jpg,N,,2025-11-27 05:56:44.254076

For the first time since the report’s inception in 2022, four green shipping corridors have now reached the ‘realisation stage’, an important milestone at which the construction and/or operation of vessels, infrastructure, and/or fuel plants takes place.

However, the report cautions that many of the 84 initiatives remain stalled by a ‘feasibility wall’ created by the cost gap between conventional and zero-emission fuels – a challenge that the Net-Zero Framework, delayed until at least next October, could help overcome.

Despite this delay, the report warns that industry and governments should not surrender the next year to a ‘wait and see’ approach. Instead, corridors should make use of emerging policies and programmes from national governments, such as the EU’s Global Gateway initiative, H2Global, and Australia’s Hydrogen Headstart programme – something that would unlock progress ahead of a global framework and put participants among the frontrunners to benefit from future IMO incentives.

We have at least 12 months before the IMO’s Net-Zero Framework is adopted, That time can either be spent waiting, or used to build projects that create strategic economic advantages, generate learnings that can influence the IMO’s reward mechanism, and put participants first in line for future global rewards. Those who act now will be best positioned to benefit when regulation catches up

His Excellency Dr. Shaikh Abdulla bin Ahmed Al Khalifa, Minister of Transport and Communications, has emphasised that Bahrain views international conventions and treaties as fundamental for building a safe and sustainable maritime sector.

H.E. Dr. Shaikh Abdulla participated in the 34th session of the General Assembly of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) held in the United Kingdom.

In his address to the General Assembly, H.E. Dr. Shaikh Abdulla bin Ahmed affirmed that since Bahrain acceded to the IMO, the Kingdom has remained an active partner, fully committed to the organisation’s goals and mission of enhancing global maritime safety and protection.

The Minister explained that the Kingdom implements its international commitments through an advanced legislative and regulatory framework, including the Maritime Law issued in 2022, which contains provisions that reinforce full compliance with maritime conventions, provide a legal framework to protect lives and property, and ensure the safety of navigation.

Commitment

He also highlighted Bahrain’s strong commitment to marine environmental protection, considering the safeguarding of the oceans and seas a humanitarian and ethical duty.

H.E. Dr. Shaikh Abdulla emphasised that the Kingdom follows a modern legislative system primarily based on the MARPOL Convention and is working to accede to the remaining annexes to support plans for achieving net-zero emissions by 2060.

The minister emphasised that the IMO’s theme for this year, “Our Ocean, Our Commitment, Our Opportunity”, reflects the environmental and economic significance of the oceans, recognising them as a lifeline and vital resource for millions of people worldwide.",https://www.newsofbahrain.com/admin/post/upload/A_He69pcwkNm_2025-11-27_1764229991resized_pic.jpg,N,,2025-11-27 03:56:12.919395

Instead, we're drifting towards a patchwork quilt of carbon schemes, stitched together by short-term politics.","As everyone either sighed with relief or rolled their eyes at the IMO's decision to delay its Net Zero Framework, few seem to grasp what could be coming while we wait for a resolution.

What looks like a pause is, in reality, a power vacuum and national regulators are already rushing to fill it.

Many countries stand to benefit, using the delay to launch their own systems. The UK's Emissions Trading Scheme (UK ETS) comes into force in June 2026.

Turkey is lining up its own version, while Gabon on Africa's west coast is openly discussing a local carbon levy. Where they lead, others will surely follow.

For governments under budget pressure, carbon pricing has less to do with environmental policy and more to do with revenue.

Countries face widening fiscal gaps and this is an easy way to plug them.

By stalling on a global standard, the industry is accelerating the creation of fragmented regional systems.

Shipping was meant to embrace decarbonisation under one flag with global rules for a global ocean. Instead, we're drifting towards a patchwork quilt of carbon schemes, stitched together by short-term politics.

Each will bring its own reporting formats, verification rules, and traps for the unwary.

Good luck to the shipowner who gets it wrong.

Picture a vessel calling at a West African port, unaware of a newly introduced local regulation. The port authority could detain it for non-compliance and the owner is left footing the bill.

The irony is hard to miss.

Charterers demand reliability, while shipowners could face fines and detentions for rules in a country they didn't even know existed. Smaller and mid-sized owners, without the luxury of in-house compliance teams, would be the first to feel the pain.

Worse still, there's no guarantee the revenues raised will fund genuine decarbonisation.

Some governments won't even know how much they'll collect from ETS schemes until year-end and when the numbers arrive, the temptation surely will be to divert them to other, more immediate causes?

Carbon markets were meant to drive cleaner ships, not fund pension deficits. Instead of aligning the industry, we may see governments chase easy cash whilst claiming its for the benefit of the planet.

Turkey's next move could trigger a domino effect.

Each new national system that gets implemented will make it harder for the IMO to rebuild a globally agreed approach later. Like a maritime Humpty Dumpty, once the rules shatter into regional fragments, they'll be impossible to piece back together.

The cost of this fragmentation is already showing.

Asian owners are quietly steering clear of European routes, wary of overlapping compliance traps. If the IMO waits much longer, trade patterns could start redrawing themselves along regulatory fault lines.

The delay is meant to give the industry time to adapt.

Instead, it risks breeding confusion, competition, and complacency. The world isn't waiting for London to decide, it's moving ahead, one emissions scheme at a time.

For shipowners, the message is clear.

Compliance can't be managed port by port or spreadsheet by spreadsheet. While the industry waits for clarity, owners need a real-time approach to tracking changing rules with reliable data and strategies that anticipate rather than react.

That's where companies like EmissionLink can help. We monitor global emissions schemes continuously, translating fast-moving regulation into practical guidance so owners can stay compliant, and stay trading without being caught by local tariff schemes.

The choice is simple. You either build the capability to track and manage compliance globally, or risk being caught out at the next port of call.

The industry needs clarity and consistency.

Either we move together or we'll end up with a hundred different systems no one can reconcile. In the end, delay doesn't buy us much time to avoid more chaos.",https://shipandbunker.cdn.speedyrails.net/a/img/_mt_327989fd8ebd00c9bef0a7d2dd619c69.jpg,N,,2025-11-27 03:56:19.523624

For the first time, green corridor initiatives have been launched in major developing economies like China, India, Brazil, Chile, Ghana, and Kenya, reflecting the significant economic opportunities that can be seized through the development of zero-emission marine fuels and bunkering capabilities in these regions, the report has said.

New green corridor initiatives have been announced in India (+4), China (+4), Brazil (+2), Chile (+2), Ghana, and Kenya etc. This aligns with governmental maritime and energy ambitions in these geographies, such as the Indian Shipping Ministry’s 2025 goals, China’s efforts to accelerate the development of port infrastructure and green fuels, Brazil’s National Hydrogen Program, Chile’s National Green Hydrogen Strategy, and national commitments to green shipping by Kenya and Ghana. In India, the new corridors include: India Green Corridors; India-Denmark Green Corridors; India-Singapore and Kandla-Tuticorin Coastal

Green Corridor.

The report comes soon after the International Maritime Organisation (IMO’s) Marine Environment Protection Committee adjourned discussions on the adoption of the Net-Zero Framework for one year. The delay was due to lobbying from the US administration, which had threatened countries with tariffs if they supported the net zero framework.

“The move of major countries like China, India, and Brazil into green corridors is hugely promising, as these are markets that will determine whether zero-emission shipping scales fast enough to meet global climate goals,” said Jesse Fahnestock, director of decarbonisation at the Global Maritime Forum in a statement. “But even more importantly, we’re seeing recognition from these countries that green corridors are more than just environmental projects – they are strategic economic infrastructure. Countries that move early stand to gain competitive industrial and geopolitical advantages across energy, trade, and technology.”

Methanol and ammonia continue to be popular fuel options in these corridors. Many agnostic green corridors continue to mention interest in battery electric propulsion. Short-sea corridors

focused on electric roll-on/roll-off passenger and ferry vessels, primarily within the

European region, remain a strong trend as well; advanced biofuels (biodiesels and biocrudes), particularly second-generation biodiesel, remain an energy source of interest for a small group of green corridors and this year also marked the first announcement of a nuclear corridor between the US and UK, the report said.

With the event now concluded — and with a few days to reflect on the key discussions, outcomes, and overall atmosphere — we took the opportunity to speak with IBIA Executive Director Alexander Prokopakis to get his take on on how it went, perspectives on some of the key takeaways and talking points, and what the association has planned for its members in the months ahead.

S&B - Looking back on the event as a whole, how satisfied are you with the outcome and what feedback have you received from delegates?

AP - We are very happy with the event. It was our third time in Hong Kong after 2005 and 2013, and this was by far the best. Not just in Hong Kong, but one of our strongest conventions to date. After Houston, Dubai, and Athens, you can see the momentum building and the increase in IBIA's relevance.

Bringing the Convention into Hong Kong Maritime Week, a wider reaching industry event, this worked well and the feedback has been great: venue, energy, and a programme that genuinely delivered.

I also want to use this moment to thank my team, the IBIA Secretariat. They put in a huge amount of work behind the scenes, and the result showed.

S&B - What were your main takeaways from Hong Kong, and were there any surprises for you - positive or negative - from the stage or sidelines?

AP - Not a surprise, but definitely a big positive was the energy in Hong Kong. The city is vibrant, Hong Kong Maritime Week was packed, and the engagement from delegates was exactly what we hoped for. It's why we chose Hong Kong in the first place.

What did surprise me, in a good way, was the level of support from the local side. The Hong Kong Shipowners Association, who I see as a real partner, the local sponsors, and the Hong Kong government were fully behind us. That made a huge difference and helped us deliver the event at the level we wanted.

S&B - IMO NZF was a big talking point. Did discussions at the event shift your view on how well suppliers and shipowners understand the current regulatory direction and/or how they will now respond?

AP - IMO's Net Zero Framework was a key topic. The discussions confirmed shipping's resilience, but also highlighted the need for all stakeholders, regulators, associations, and the industry to work more closely together to collectively address the concerns raised about the IMO NZF and risks that future regulatory changes may present to the industry.

It's an opportunity to create a stronger, practical framework to meet the targets. The Convention reinforced that bunkers are more relevant to shipping than ever. Whilst there was a strong emphasis on alternative fuels, we recognise that conventional fuels aren't going anywhere soon. We need to stay focused on today's reality, ensuring safety, supporting seafarers, and delivering fuels transparently and reliably for the industry.

S&B - MFMs were another recurring theme at the event, with both official and informal announcements about new markets preparing to adopt the technology, and discussion around IBIA's role in supporting that uptake. After participating in these conversations, how would you describe IBIA's current position and responsibilities in advancing MFM adoption on both a worldwide basis and regionally via initiatives such as BSI in ARA?

AP - IBIA's position on MFMs has been clear and constant from the start: we support a more transparent industry. We welcome the announcement that Hong Kong is to make MFM mandatory for methanol bunkering, we encourage this for all products, and the news that the Republic of Korea may do the same for all marine fuel deliveries.

MFM is a tool that works best under a common global regulatory framework. Ideally this is the ISO standards or the SS648:2024 which Singapore is using and has been tested and proven.

But it's not just about the tool itself; it's how it's implemented and enforced. IBIA is vocal in supporting ports and industry initiatives, but global adoption is still limited. Can MFM help the industry? Absolutely. But we need consistent rules and practical application.

As for regional initiatives such as BSI in ARA, IBIA supports collaboration among stakeholders, especially between our members. My understanding is that the BSI initiative in ARA is launching officially soon; we're waiting for more details. I'd like to see tangible outcomes that improve transparency in the industry, and we'll be watching to see how it develops. If it can help address the current challenges and improve transparency, that would be very welcome.

Allow me to add and inform the Ship & Bunker readers that IBIA, in collaboration with C4fuel and with support from the Ports of Rotterdam and Antwerp, has delivered comprehensive training for surveyors. We strongly believe that tools are only effective when users have the awareness, training, and knowledge to use them properly. Ideally, we'd like to see this kind of training and regulation made mandatory, similar to the approach in Singapore.

S&B - What topics or emerging priorities do you anticipate will take centre stage and shape the agenda at next year's event?

AP - It's a bit early to say, the Convention has just finished! Shipping and bunkering are constantly evolving. Next year's agenda will depend on the region we choose. The decision will be made in the coming months and announced at the IBIA Annual Dinner in London on February 9th.

Ultimately, the priorities will come from our members and what matters most to the industry at that time.

S&B - Until then, which upcoming IBIA events should readers be aware of, and what can they expect from them?

AP - Nice question, thank you for the opportunity. On December 10th, we have our Members' Meeting, reviewing 2025 and looking ahead to 2026, giving members the chance to shape our focus.

Our first major premier event of the year is the much-anticipated IBIA Annual Dinner in London. Likely another sold-out night with around 1,200 industry leaders, kicking off IE Week.

We'll also host a networking event in the US at CMA in March, following last year's success, before moving to Singapore for Maritime Week in April, where the IBIA Asia Dinner will bring together around 350 industry players.

Later in the year, we're back in Athens for Posidonia with a cocktail reception, and then the major bunkering industry event, SIBCON in Singapore.

Monitoring IMO meetings, following industry and regulatory developments, and providing training for our members is core to what we do. Through our working groups, we focus on key areas like technical aspects, bunker licensing & mass flow meters, alternative fuels, and digitalization, all essential to supporting the industry and helping members.

China, India, and Brazil look to capture major opportunities in zero-emission shipping amidst regulatory uncertainty.

Report warns against ‘wait and see’ attitude following delay to the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) Net-Zero Framework.

Report calls for action at the national level to drive progress, create first-mover advantage, and position for early access to future IMO incentives.

27 November 2025, Copenhagen – The movement to create green shipping corridors – trade routes designed to demonstrate and scale novel zero-emission fuels, vessels, and technologies – has expanded in numbers and geographic scope, according to a new progress report published today by the Getting to Zero Coalition and the Global Maritime Forum.

This year’s edition, At a Crossroads: Annual Progress Report on Green Shipping Corridors 2025, identifies 25 new green corridor initiatives, expanding the global total to 84 active initiatives. For the first time, initiatives have been launched in major developing economies like China, India, Brazil, Chile, Ghana, and Kenya, reflecting the significant economic opportunities that can be seized through the development of zero-emission marine fuels and bunkering capabilities in these regions.

The news comes only a month after discussions to adopt the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) landmark Net-Zero Framework, designed to establish a path for shipping to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, were delayed for at least one year.

“The move of major countries like China, India, and Brazil into green corridors is hugely promising, as these are markets that will determine whether zero-emission shipping scales fast enough to meet global climate goals,” Jesse Fahnestock, director of decarbonisation at the Global Maritime Forum, said. “But even more importantly, we’re seeing recognition from these countries that green corridors are more than just environmental projects – they are strategic economic infrastructure. Countries that move early stand to gain competitive industrial and geopolitical advantages across energy, trade, and technology.”

For the first time since the report’s inception in 2022, four green shipping corridors have now reached the ‘realisation stage’, an important milestone at which the construction and/or operation of vessels, infrastructure, and/or fuel plants takes place. However, the report cautions that many of the 84 initiatives remain stalled by a 'feasibility wall' created by the cost gap between conventional and zero-emission fuels – a challenge that the Net-Zero Framework, delayed until at least next October, could help overcome.

Despite this delay, the report warns that industry and governments should not surrender the next year to a 'wait and see' approach. Instead, corridors should make use of emerging policies and programmes from national governments, such as the EU’s Global Gateway initiative, H2Global, and Australia’s Hydrogen Headstart programme – something that would unlock progress ahead of a global framework and put participants among the frontrunners to benefit from future IMO incentives.

“We have at least 12 months before the IMO’s Net-Zero Framework is adopted,” Fahnestock said. “That time can either be spent waiting, or used to build projects that create strategic economic advantages, generate learnings that can influence the IMO’s reward mechanism, and put participants first in line for future global rewards. Those who act now will be best positioned to benefit when regulation catches up.”

To best expand and progress green corridors, the report recommends the industry:

Pursue strategies to break inertia and maintain momentum, closing the cost gap and ensuring corridors are advanced enough to qualify for first mover rewards once they’re available.

Capitalise on the opportunity to shape IMO policy, like the reward mechanism, and be well-positioned to benefit from eventual regulation.

Better engage those with ambitious decarbonisation goals that can help scale solutions, particularly cargo owners who may be more willing to pay a premium for cleaner fuels.

Utilise emerging national policy and adapt it for new geographies to accelerate change and encourage industry buy-in.

Stay true to original principles, remembering that green corridors’ greatest contribution to maritime decarbonisation comes from fostering collaboration and prioritising harder-to-deploy e-fuels over more readily available solutions.

Momentum builds as an Acu-Antwerp corridor is identified as a high potential green e-fuel export corridor with considerable stakeholder interest.

Earlier this month in Rio de Janeiro, a critical piece of the maritime decarbonization puzzle fell into place. The Oceans of Opportunity Summit brought together senior leaders from ports, shipping companies, energy developers, financiers, and government to advance Brazil’s e-fuel export opportunity. The gathering highlighted Brazil’s emergence as a maritime e-fuel powerhouse and discussed a pre-feasibility study conducted by RMI that reveals a strong business case for a green e-fuel export corridor from the Port of Açu to the Port of Antwerp-Bruges.

Brazil’s competitive advantage: World-class conditions for low-cost e-fuel production

Brazil has positioned itself as an emerging green fuel leader with unique advantages that set it apart from competing global production hubs. Its world-class renewable capacity, largely renewable grid, and abundant biogenic carbon and freshwater make it one of the most attractive locations for e-fuel production globally.

In addition to strong e-fuel production fundamentals, Brazil has advanced its regulatory landscape in recent years. The National Hydrogen Program (PNH2) signaled Brazil’s ambition to become a competitive global producer and develop low-carbon hydrogen hubs. Building on this, the Legal Framework for Low-Carbon Hydrogen created the National Certification System (SBCH2) that will certify emissions aligned with international standards. Additionally, the tax benefit regime, Rehidro, was created along with tax credits through Low-Carbon Hydrogen Development Program (PHBC).

Together, these regulatory advancements enable certifiable decarbonization, e-fuel export certification compatibility, improve project bankability, and support the development of e-fuel hubs like the Port of Açu.

The Port of Açu is already a significant industrial hub in Brazil, and it is primed to support the development of significant e-fuel projects. As one of Latin America’s largest deepwater and private port-industrial complexes, it has joined the World Economic Forum’s Low-Carbon Industrial Clusters initiative and is positioned to drive decarbonization in hard-to-abate sectors.

The Port of Açu has also generated interest from e-fuel developers. Açu-based developers have announced projects of up to 800,000 metric tons per year of e-methanol and 2.5 million metric tons per year of e-ammonia. As with any global e-fuel project, they face uncertainty, and not all announced volumes may materialize. Securing offtake is critical to improving viability, and green e-fuel export corridors to Europe can provide Açu-based projects with access to one of the world’s fastest-growing green fuel markets.

IMO policy framework could shift maritime economics toward zero-emission fuels

The International Maritime Organization’s Net-Zero Framework, which is on the Marine Environment Protection Committee’s (MEPC) October 2026 agenda for adoption, could fundamentally shift the economics of maritime decarbonization if adopted. New greenhouse gas regulations and fuel-intensity standards create increasingly favorable conditions for zero and near-zero-emission fuels, providing the financial incentives the sector needs to transition. Under proposed IMO reward incentives, zero-emission vessels running on ammonia or methanol can narrow or even eliminate lifetime cost premiums compared to conventional fuel operations on the Brazil-Europe route.

E-fuel exports to Europe can de-risk and accelerate production scale-up at Port of Açu

The European Union’s regulatory framework — combining FuelEU Maritime mandates with Emissions Trading System (ETS) requirements — already initiates a market pull for zero-emission fuels. These policy frameworks could generate significant demand within the next decade.

European industrial and maritime sectors are already driving appetite for green fuels across Northwest Europe’s major industrial clusters and shipping routes. Demand by 2035 could amount to almost 12 million metric tons per year of green ammonia, considering demand from the fertilizer, refining, and maritime sectors, and almost 4 million metric tons per year of green methanol, considering demand from the maritime sector.1

The Port of Antwerp-Bruges, among the continent’s largest industrial and bunkering hubs, could capture about 15 percent of EU green-fuel demand. This figure reflects estimated demand in Belgium and portions of Germany, together with the Port’s stated estimates and ambition for the markets it aims to serve. The port is rapidly expanding its multi-fuel infrastructure, with methanol handling already underway and ammonia capability expanding.

Strong momentum: Senior maritime leaders convene to advance the Açu-Antwerp corridor

The Oceans of Opportunity Summit demonstrated clear momentum for Brazil’s e-fuel opportunity. The convening of senior leaders from ports, shipping lines, energy developers, financiers, and government officials confirmed the sector’s commitment to making this opportunity operational.

The workshop that followed convened a smaller group, bringing together actors interested in potentially forming a consortium for the delivery of an Açu-Antwerp green fuel export corridor. E-fuel producers, port authorities from Açu and Antwerp, and shipping lines with zero-emission-capable vessels all joined the dialogue, underlining the sense of interest

High-potential corridor: Pre-feasibility confirms strong economics and path forward

RMI’s pre-feasibility study presented at the summit confirms that the Açu-Antwerp corridor is a high-potential route for multiple reasons. First, demand signals from European ports and industrial clusters provide greater demand visibility for Açu production, as the Port of Antwerp-Bruges is one of Europe’s largest bunkering hubs and petrochemical clusters. Second, vessel economics on the Brazil-Europe route can approach cost parity with conventional fuels under proposed IMO reward scenarios. Third, the infrastructure requirements are buildable on realistic timelines to support e-fuel exports at the Port of Açu and imports at the Port of Antwerp-Bruges.

Despite its high potential, the corridor faces several challenges. Greater clarity is needed on the extent to which Açu-based projects will be EU RFNBO compliant. The IMO Net-Zero Framework’s adoption was delayed until 2026, adding uncertainty around how significant net-zero fuel incentives will be for the maritime sector. Lastly, while exports to Europe provide some of the best global offtake conditions, securing firm offtake agreements remains difficult. These challenges can create uncertainty and reduce project bankability. However, increased collaboration across the supply chain can help overcome them, underscoring the importance of green corridor consortiums.

The coalition is now pursuing what could become the world’s first major e-fuel export corridor. The next phase involves a comprehensive feasibility study that will refine these findings with greater precision: detailed delivered-cost modeling, feasible offtake structures that prioritize maritime demand, confirmed vessel and engine availability, including pilot fuel requirements, and a financial structure that strategically layers IMO rewards, EU incentives, and Brazilian programs. Export corridor operations are targeted to begin between 2030 and 2035.

Why these findings matter beyond one corridor

The Açu-Antwerp corridor represents a breakthrough moment for maritime decarbonization. It demonstrates that green fuels can be produced competitively in the Global South and delivered to demand centers with improving economics that narrow the gap with conventional fuels, especially as policy incentives are developed.

The timing is critical. The Rio summit came just a week before COP30 in Brazil, and the maritime sector — responsible for nearly 3 percent of global emissions — has long been considered one of the hardest-to-abate industries. Barriers are solvable: the technology is ready to scale, the infrastructure is buildable, and the economics are tractable. Now it’s time for industry action. From Açu to Antwerp, Brazil is poised to steer the world’s first major e-fuel corridor—turning the tide toward a net-zero ocean.

The Oceans of Opportunity Summit was convened by RMI, the Global Maritime Forum, Prumo Logística/Port of Açu, Port of Antwerp-Bruges International, and the International Association of Ports and Harbors.

Summary of amendments

Amendments to the Polar Code, adopted through IMO Resolution MSC.538(107) in June 2023, will enter into force on 1 January 2026. These revisions expand mandatory safety requirements for navigation and voyage planning to include specific categories of non-SOLAS ships, aiming to enhance operational safety and preparedness in polar environments. Vessels constructed before 1 January 2026 must achieve full compliance with the new regulations by 1 January 2027.

However, any vessels constructed on or after 1 January 2026 will need to comply with the new requirements as soon as they start to operate in polar waters. The following sections outline the key amendments and associated compliance actions.

Applicable vessels

The Polar Code amendments are applicable to:

fishing vessels of 24 meters in length overall and above;

pleasure yachts of 300 gross tonnage and upwards not engaged in trade;

cargo ships of 300 gross tonnage and upwards but below 500 gross tonnage.

Background

The IMO Polar Code includes mandatory measures covering safety part (part I-A) and pollution prevention (part II-A) and recommendatory provisions for both (parts I-B and II-B). The Code entered into force on 1 January 2017 for new vessels. Ships constructed before 1 January 2017 had to meet the safety requirements of the Polar Code by the first intermediate or renewal survey, whichever occurred first, after 1 January 2018. The environmental provisions of the Polar Code applied both to existing ships and new ships from 1 January 2017.

The Polar Code covers the full range of design, construction, equipment, operational, training, search and rescue and environmental protection matters to increase the safety of ships operating in polar waters and reduce the risk and damage to the polar environment.

Furthermore, IMO made amendments to SOLAS introduced by Resolution MSC.532(107) and to the Polar Code, introduced by Resolution MSC.538(107) to apply specific new provisions of the Code to certain non-SOLAS vessels that operate in polar waters. The rules mandate safety requirements, including those for voyage planning and safety of navigation, in new regulations (9-1 and 11-1) of the Code.

Chapter 9-1, Safety of Navigation

An additional chapter was inserted after the existing Chapter 9 applicable to non-SOLAS ships as defined above. The new chapter provides goals, functional requirements, and prescriptive regulations related to safe navigation in polar waters. This includes the ability to receive up-to-date information including ice information, the navigation equipment and systems are designed for the expected environmental conditions, systems for providing reference headings and position fixing are suitable for the intended areas, and the ability to visually detect ice when operating in darkness.

Chapter 11-1, Voyage planning

An additional chapter was inserted after the existing Chapter 11 applicable to non-SOLAS ships as defined above. The new chapter provides goals, functional requirements, and prescriptive regulations related to voyage planning for operations in polar waters. The voyage planning requirements shall consider the following:

the procedures required by the safety management system on board; if no safety management system is implemented there shall be a documented procedure for operation in polar waters;

any limitations of the hydrographic information and aids to navigation available;

current information on the extent and type of ice and icebergs in the vicinity of the intended route;

statistical information on ice and temperatures from former years;

places of refuge;

current information and measures to be taken when marine mammals are encountered relating to known areas with densities of marine mammals, including seasonal migration areas;

current information on relevant ships’ routing systems, speed recommendations and vessel traffic services relating to known areas with densities of marine mammals, including seasonal migration areas;

national and international designated protected areas along the route;

operation in areas remote from search and rescue (SAR) capabilities.

Actions for compliance

To ensure safe operations in polar waters, companies, masters, and crew must be provided with adequate information that supports the safety of the vessel, personnel on board, and, where applicable, environmental protection.

Ships are required to adhere to the Polar Code’s performance standards and conduct thorough operational assessments.

Navigational equipment and systems must meet the updated functional requirements, and voyage planning must incorporate a comprehensive assessment of potential hazards along the intended route to ensure safe and effective navigation in polar waters.",https://safety4sea.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/shutterstock_1791438932-e1758795230221.jpg,N,,2025-11-26 16:56:31.648913

In response, DNV and the World Maritime Merchants Forum (WMMF) ESG team have published a new guide to help shipowners navigate these evolving challenges, an effort supported by industry organizations in Hong Kong and worldwide.

The “Net-Zero Guide: Practical Approaches for Global Shipping Companies” provides a structured roadmap for advancing decarbonization. Drawing on data-driven insights and real-world operator experience, the guide offers actionable steps for shipowners to align operational and investment decisions with both international and regional regulations. It also helps companies navigate uncertainties, adopt best practices, and take pragmatic actions that prepare them for future changes in a rapidly evolving landscape.

Knut Ørbeck-Nilssen, CEO, DNV Maritime said: “Shipping’s decarbonization journey continues despite the postponement at the IMO. The reality is that energy efficiency and fuel flexibility or readiness are still considered and implemented on vessels. Continuing on this course will maintain competitiveness and contribute to the sector’s long-term decarbonization goals. The collaboration with World Maritime Merchants Forum (WMMF) on this guide is itself a testament to the importance of working together to pave the way for successful decarbonization.”

Mr. Wang Yong Xin, the President of China Merchants Energy Shipping (CMES) said: “The Net-Zero Guide offers the industry a wealth of practical reference cases in a complex transition environment, helping shipping companies strike a balance between short-term operations and long-term emissions reduction.”

The guide addresses the increasing complexity and cost of compliance, especially for small and medium enterprises (SMEs), and outlines procedures to manage costs while supporting the transition of fleets toward net-zero emissions. It also sets out cost-effective actions, such as energy-efficiency upgrades, phased fuel transitions, and targeted fleet renewal or retrofits, to control expenses and avoid stranded assets. By aligning investments with operational improvements and market expectations, shipowners can strengthen their commercial resilience and position themselves for long-term success.

Shipowners are also urged to embed decarbonization into their core business strategies. This includes linking compliance with fleet investment and financing, while adopting a lifecycle approach to fleet management that balances renewal, retrofits, and operational optimization. Structured competence development and robust change management are essential to building organizational capability and supporting sustainable growth. By leveraging partnerships across the value chain and investing in digitalization and data governance, companies can enhance transparency, ensure regulatory compliance, and unlock long-term efficiencies.",https://cyprusshippingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/zero-emission-shipping.jpg,N,,2025-11-26 12:57:10.205265

National standards governing ballast water management In Brazil, NORMAM 401 establishes the standards for ballast water management and the penalties for noncompliance.
Bacilli and other forms of pathogenic organisms can also be transported from one region to another through discharged ballast water.
The bioinvasion issue is growing because global shipping moves around 10 billion tons of ballast water per year.","The Santos Port Authority has resumed enforcement of the rule requiring ships to present a certificate of compliance with international ballast water discharge inspection standards before docking. The measure follows a decision by Justice Teodoro Silva Santos of the Superior Court of Justice (STJ), who granted an injunction in favor of the port authority.

The ruling upholds the injunction filed by the state-owned company against a decision by the National Waterway Transport Agency (Antaq), which had declared the rule invalid. The regulatory body argued that the Santos Port Authority had exceeded its powers, claiming it lacked jurisdiction to regulate the matter.

National standards governing ballast water management

In Brazil, NORMAM 401 establishes the standards for ballast water management and the penalties for noncompliance. Ships have two options: D1 – to discharge ballast water in oceanic waters, at least 200 nautical miles from the coast in areas with a minimum depth of 200 meters, or at 50 miles from the coast provided that the depth is also equal to or greater than 200 meters. D2 – the performance standard, usually met through the installation of onboard treatment systems. The most common methods combine filters with ultraviolet lamps or filters with an electrochlorination process.

Before the new rule by the Port Authority, vessel inspections were carried out by sampling, based on information provided by ship captains. Under the reinstated regulation, all vessels must be monitored.

The issue, however, is that only one company has been accredited by the port authority to perform this monitoring. In practice, certification costs an average of about US$ 1,500 per vessel – which users argue constitutes regulatory overreach.

The accredited company is responsible for verifying compliance based on information provided by ships, such as geographic coordinates, using artificial intelligence, GPS, and other technologies to confirm whether ballast water was discharged in authorized areas or whether the filtration systems required by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and Brazil’s NORMAM 401 were used.

According to the Port Authority, the rule is essential for local environmental protection, noting that one-third of vessels failed to meet legal obligations while the regulation was in force, highlighting shortcomings in existing inspection mechanisms. “The inspections prevent environmental damage caused by invasive and harmful species to marine life and the environment. For now, no fines will be issued, allowing shipowners time to comply with the regulation,” said Sidnei Aranha, Superintendent of Environment at the port authority.

Aranha explained that ships, by bringing residues such as sewage, toxic materials, or exotic species in their ballast water, can cause serious environmental and public health problems. Many of these animal and plant species are endemic, have no natural predators, and can reproduce quickly, competing with native species.

Bacilli and other forms of pathogenic organisms can also be transported from one region to another through discharged ballast water. The bioinvasion issue is growing because global shipping moves around 10 billion tons of ballast water per year. In Brazil alone, the figure reaches 80 million tons annually, as 95% of the country’s foreign trade is conducted by sea.

Details of the rule

Prices charged by the sole company authorized to provide the mandatory service at the Port of Santos:

US$ 1,700 per certificate for services requested by non-member maritime agencies;

US$ 1,390 per certificate for services requested by maritime agencies that are members of the Association of Shipping Agencies.

Required documentation for vessel certification

To obtain the certificate, vessels must submit the following documents:",https://safety4sea.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/shutterstock_1880019457-e1764167304508.jpg,N,,2025-11-26 12:57:15.943345

Developments at Rotterdam Rotterdam, the top European port by cargo throughput, is undergoing several expansion projects for LNG and biofuel tanks.
In April, Trammo completed a ship-to-ship transfer of 800 cu m of ammonia at OCI’s terminal in preparation for future ammonia bunkering.
In October, OCI signed a memorandum of understanding with Victrol for ammonia bunkering in Rotterdam, Platts reported earlier.
Rotterdam has established a joint venture with Eneco, Rotterdam Shore Power, to execute shoreside power projects in coordination with government-owned grid operators for terminals.","The Dutch port of Rotterdam is pushing ahead with infrastructure expansion for sustainable marine energy, but global decarbonization rules would be required for an industry-wide low-carbon bunker transition, the port’s Chief Operating Officer Berte Simons, told Platts, part of S&P Global Energy.

LNG and biofuel bunker sales at Rotterdam, the world’s second-largest marine refueling hub, have been on an upward trend in recent years, with the port authority kickstarting its pursuit of climate neutrality by 2050.

The port reported 2.45 million metric tons of marine fuel sales during July-September, of which alternatives to conventional, oil-based fuels accounted for 13.2%, the highest among major bunker ports. Deliveries of biofuels, composed mainly of biodiesel-fuel oil blends, reached 201,319 mt, and fossil LNG amounted to 121,614 mt.

“For the next few years, we will have LNG there together with new green fuels for quite some time,” Simons said in a recent interview. “We have set out to increase the volume of biofuels and to come up with bunkering facilities for new fuels, to work on imports and exports and bunkering strategies for hydrogen, ammonia and methanol.”

The continued efforts to decarbonize Rotterdam’s bunker mix came despite International Maritime Organization member states voting in mid-October to postpone the Net-Zero Framework by a year, Platts reported earlier.

The proposed regulation, backed by the Netherlands and nearly all other EU states, was designed to promote the uptake of low-carbon fuels by placing a cost on maritime greenhouse gas emissions from 2028.

“The postponement of the adoption of the IMO’s Net-Zero Framework is a major setback,” Simons said. “The absence of a global level playing field, long term perspective and limited demand for sustainable transportation make it difficult to scale and remain competitive.”

Brussels has extended its Emissions Trading System to cover shipping from 2024, while introducing FuelEU Maritime rules on marine energy’s greenhouse gas intensity in January, pushing up total refueling expenses for ships in EU-related trades.

October’s average delivered bunker costs for B30 with 30% used cooking oil methyl ester in Rotterdam were $841.70/mt for ships sailing to a non-EU port, according to the Platts bunker cost calculator. Costs for B24 were $728.46/mt in Singapore, the world’s largest bunker port, for ships on voyages to an EU port.

Developments at Rotterdam

Rotterdam, the top European port by cargo throughput, is undergoing several expansion projects for LNG and biofuel tanks.

At the Gate terminal, a new LNG storage tank of 180,000 cu m and additional regasification capacity of 4 bank cubic meters per year is due to be operational by the second half of 2026.

Bunker supplier Peninsula will add eight tanks with a total capacity of 80,000 cu m to its biofuel storage and blending facilities in Chane Terminal next January, bringing its total capacity to 110,000 cu m.

Rotterdam currently handles 2 million mt/year of methanol and 400,000 mt/year of ammonia, predominantly made from fossil fuels, but those would lay the foundation for the transition to sustainable methanol and ammonia bunkering, according to Simons.

The port has been piloting methanol bunkering projects. In April, Trammo completed a ship-to-ship transfer of 800 cu m of ammonia at OCI’s terminal in preparation for future ammonia bunkering. In October, OCI signed a memorandum of understanding with Victrol for ammonia bunkering in Rotterdam, Platts reported earlier.

“We are also preparing for bunkering of liquid hydrogen for short-sea shipping,” Simons said. “We are focused on having the infrastructure for new bunker fuels.”

However, the executive stressed that the marine energy transition would depend on the supply-demand fundamentals for green fuels, whose prices are higher than conventional fuels due to limited production.

“Real growth in the uptake of sustainable fuels depends on clear, consistent, and global regulation,” Simons said. “The Net-Zero Framework provides a crucial step forward — so we hope next year the NZF will be adopted.”

Shoreside power

Simons said Rotterdam has 10 berths for ocean-going ships installed with shoreside power charging network and 100 cabinets for inland shipping, with plans for further expansion.

Based on EU regulations, container and passenger ships must be connected to charging facilities by 2030 at the main EU ports listed in the trans-European transport network, including Rotterdam. The ports, in turn, are required to develop the infrastructure to meet 90% of ship operators’ demand.

While inland ships can be fully electrified due to limited space for on-board battery systems, large, ocean-going ships could be designed or retrofitted to run on power at berth and turn off their auxiliary engines during “cold-ironing,” leading to lower marine fuel use and CO2 emissions as well as less air pollution.

“At the moment we have only a few OPS installations operational for cruise, ferries, offshore and smaller vessels. We are, however, fully on track to realize installations at the container terminals that will bring us to compliance,” Simons said, adding that the port’s estimated planned capacity in 2030 will be well over 150 MW.

Rotterdam has established a joint venture with Eneco, Rotterdam Shore Power, to execute shoreside power projects in coordination with government-owned grid operators for terminals. Terminal operators can also develop their own charging systems.",,N,,2025-11-26 10:56:56.817788

The recent one-year delay to the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) Net-Zero Framework at the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) second Extraordinary Session underlines an important truth for the maritime sector: the regulatory landscape is in a state of flux and can be difficult to predict. Additionally, the pause will likely result in a patchwork of competing regional greenhouse gas emissions regulations, further complicating compliance.

This poses challenges to the industry in a number of ways, but perhaps one of the less appreciated relates to harnessing the power of fleet analytics solutions to boost efficiency and profitability, while simultaneously supporting compliance with shifting regulations.

It’s against this backdrop that less advanced reporting solutions will fall short of what is required – basic database software or more simplistic noon reporting is unlikely to deliver for the industry at a time of evolving complexity. Instead, there is an increased need for more sophisticated solutions offering simpler, more efficient and more accurate real-time reporting, while minimising the risk of human error.

Whether because of the introduction of new regulations or a steady uptake of alternative fuels, the future is set to look different, and the industry requires fleet analytics solutions that keep pace with these changes.

Future-proofed solutions

The good news for the industry is that advanced fleet analytics solutions increasingly are designed to ensure compliance with the latest existing regulatory requirements.

This means that shipowners aren’t forced to manage splitting voyages according to the requirements of MRV, for example, because they have solutions designed to automatically organise data into the exact required structure. This is equally the case when it comes to ensuring compliance with the likes of other mandatory regulatory requirements such as the Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII), FuelEU, and European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS).

As regulatory efforts to control emissions intensify, these reporting solutions can prove particularly valuable – enabling shipowners to automatically import sensor data on fuel consumption without manual calculations.

This automation also drastically reduces the time spent by crew and shore-based personnel on repetitive data entry, reconciliation, and compilation. Hours of manual work can be reduced to minutes of review.

Additionally, these solutions allow shipowners to cross-reference reported fuel consumption with engine power, speed over ground, and bunker delivery notes (BDNs), providing further reassurance of accuracy.

Laying the groundwork for machine learning

Alongside ensuring maritime businesses are prepared for new regulatory requirements, more sophisticated fleet analytics solutions also lay the groundwork for realising the potential of advancing machine learning technologies.

This is because they enable businesses to combine automatically collated data within the same system as they store manual records, providing opportunities for superior performance analysis and the training of machine learning models by harnessing insights from both data sources. As new technologies emerge, these smarter reporting tools lay the groundwork for seizing the potential of the future, while enhancing decision making, slashing costs and reducing risk in the present.

Fitness for the future

Realising the full reporting potential of these solutions can prove transformative, ensuring accurate and compliant data is recorded automatically. We’ve heard of instances where shipowners have dealt with hundreds of reporting problems and reduced these to zero simply through investing in the latest solutions.

These will only prove more valuable at a time when the landscape is evolving and there might be challenges on the horizon – whether new regulations or the increased use of alternative fuels.

… said Dominguez.

Furthermore, the Sec-Gen acknowledged the “complex international environment” confronting global shipping, citing geopolitical tensions, shifting trade dynamics, and rapid technological and environmental transitions.

My strategic priorities, then, and now, are, to advance our sector, progressing on matters such as safety, security, decarbonization and automation; to increase our visibility as an Organization and as a sector; to be more diverse and transparent, and to enhance our support to all our Member States, particularly in the areas of technical cooperation and capacity development.

… the Secretary-General highlighted.

He also highlighted recent impacts on seafarers and vessels in the Red Sea and the Black Sea, calling them “unjust” examples of maritime workers being caught in geopolitical crosscurrents.

Despite these challenges, he underscored the vital role shipping continues to play in sustaining global trade and development.

Progress on safety, climate and technology

Reviewing the Organization’s work over the past biennium, the Secretary-General highlighted progress across key committees:

Maritime Safety Committee: Advancements in navigation safety, training standards, and regulatory frameworks for new fuels and technologies.

Marine Environment Protection Committee: Continued implementation of the IMO Greenhouse Gas Strategy, along with work on marine litter, biofouling, underwater noise, and ballast water management.

Legal Committee: Efforts to address fraudulent ship registration and protect seafarers from abandonment and criminalization.

Facilitation Committee: Major steps toward digitalization, including the now-mandatory maritime single window system.

Technical Cooperation Committee: Expanded capacity-building initiatives to support developing Member States in meeting IMO obligations.

Dominguez emphasized that these achievements are collective, praising Member States for what he described as “steady commitment” across all areas of IMO’s mandate.

Assembly to take up strategic plan, budget and key resolutions

The Assembly will consider the IMO’s revised Strategic Plan for 2024–2029, which outlines the Organization’s mission and long-term priorities. Delegates are also expected to approve the 2026–2027 budget and work programme.

Several major resolutions are slated for adoption, including:

The first comprehensive IMO Capacity Development Strategy, establishing a unified framework for technical assistance and cooperation.

The Framework and Procedures for the second cycle of the IMO Member State Audit Scheme, aimed at strengthening global implementation and transparency.

A proposal to enhance multilingualism, including introducing Arabic as a working language of the Assembly.

Internal reforms and a “fresh energy” at IMO

Dominguez also pointed to internal reforms undertaken during his tenure, including updates to staff rules, new diversity and gender strategies, improved communications, and upgrades to IMO headquarters facilities. Even the IMO logo, he noted with a smile, has undergone a facelift.

I have had to shake and restructure IMO a little, and I have had to shake you, the delegates, up a little too

… he said, adding that constructive pushback from Member States keeps him “on his toes.”

A final tribute to seafarers

Reaffirming a recurring theme of his tenure, Dominguez closed by paying tribute to the world’s seafarers, calling them the “heart of the maritime sector” and praising their resilience and professionalism amid global challenges.

With confidence in the delegates’ leadership, he urged the Assembly to deliver “meaningful outcomes” that will strengthen the Organization and support a safer, more sustainable and more inclusive future for global shipping.",https://safety4sea.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/54943866976_52e4b41773_o-scaled-e1764154449953.jpg,N,,2025-11-26 10:57:15.947673

GHG reduction progress

Achieved 11.8% reduction in Scope 1 + 2 emissions from FY2021

Decreasing factors: Energy-saving devices, slow steaming, expanded use of biofuels, replacement with newbuilds, including alternative-fuel vessels

Increasing factors: Increased voyage distances due to inability to transit the Suez Canal (geopolitical issues)

Expanded Scope 3 emissions reporting

― Expanded reporting to include all major consolidated subsidiaries and equity-method affiliates

― Collected emissions data across all Scope 3 categories

― Completed disclosure one year earlier than the original plan

Towards achieving the Scope 1 + 2 2030 and 2050 targets

2030 Target: 45% reduction by energy efficiency and low-carbon fuels

The medium-term management plan initially set a target to reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions for the NYK Group by 30% compared to FY2021 by FY2030. This target was updated in the NDS, adding an additional 15% reduction.

2050 Target: Net zero by fuel conversion and CDRs

The transition to alternative fuels will be accelerated, together with carbon dioxide removal (CDR) initiatives, to achieve net-zero emissions.

Expansion of biofuels

NYK reports a steady increase on the use of biofuels. This effort in FY2024 is equivalent to a reduction of 180,000 tons of CO2 equivalent. The company has launched long-term trials aimed at full-scale implementation of biofuel usage.

As a result, NYK’s vessels used 251,017 tons of B24, a blended marine fuel containing 24% second-generation fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) derived from nonfood sources and certified under ISCC.

This marks a significant increase over the 6,287 tons used in fiscal year 2023. Moreover, the company implemented initiatives to address challenges related to the long-term safe use of biofuels.

Initiation of continuous use of bio-LNG fuel

Since June 2025, NYK has commenced the continuous use of bio-LNG fuel on its LNG-powered car carriers. The bio-LNG fuel is supplied by Titan Supply B.V. at the Port of Zeebrugge in Belgium. Starting with the supply to two vessels—Daisy Leader in June and Sumire Leader in July—the company will integrate LNG biofuel into its routine operations.

This supply is based on the mass-balance method, enabling significant GHG reductions on a well-to-wake basis. Its sustainability is verified through ISCC-EU certification, and full traceability is ensured.",https://safety4sea.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/shutterstock_2565837287-scaled-e1747304616969.jpg,N,,2025-11-26 10:57:21.841003

Retrofit options offered to existing X-DF engines include intelligent control by exhaust recycling (iCER) and variable compression ratio (VCR) technology.

""The frame agreement, signed during Kormarine 2025, will support ship operators in reducing their cost exposure to maritime carbon pricing, keeping existing vessels competitive for longer,"" WinGD said of the deal.

Panasia is an established marine technology developer in South Korea and has system integrator contracts with multiple Korean and Chinese shipyards.

WinGD head of retrofit & upgrade solutions René Baart said, “Korea has been the biggest market for X-DF engines since they were introduced in 2016. It was therefore natural that we start here as we aim to upgrade our installed base to the latest efficient technologies. We are delighted to have found a partner, in Panasia, with so much expertise in the equipment and system integration of both Chinese and Korean-built vessels.”

While iCER uses exhaust recycling to improve combustion stability when using LNG, VCR technology increases fuel efficiency by automatically optimising compression ratio depending on the fuel used and engine load. When combined, iCER and VCR technologies can reduce methane slip to around 0.7% of fuel gas volume, a more than two-fold reduction compared with first-generation X‑DF engines.

These indicators are based on objective data, such as throughput volumes, berth productivity, emissions per Twenty-foot Equivalent Unit (TEU), and alternative fuel availability, and are complemented by expert assessments from leading shipping stakeholders.

Global importance of maritime transport

Maritime transport remains the backbone of international trade, with container ports alone handling over 80% of global non-bulk merchandise trade, underscoring their central role in sustaining large-scale economic activity. These global container ports are undergoing a period of remarkable transformation, propelled by surging trade volumes, rapid technological advancement, and intensifying climate imperatives.

In 2024, worldwide container ports throughput soared to an unprecedented 931.8mTEU, marking a 7.8% rebound after several years of subdued growth. Asian ports continue to set the pace, with Chinese terminals alone accounting for more than 40% of global container traffic.

Shanghai established a new world record, processing 51.5 million TEUs, driven by its strategic location in China’s manufacturing heartland and strong integration with China’s export economy. In comparison, Singapore achieved 41.1 million TEUs, supported by its status as a key transhipment hub.

In the United States, ports remain key economic engines, supporting 30.8 million jobs and contributing $5.4 trillion to the country’s GDP, accounting for 26% of national output. Meanwhile, emerging economies such as India, Türkiye, and Vietnam have posted double-digit growth in container volumes, driven by supply chain diversification and nearshoring strategies.

Geopolitical disruptions to global supply chains

Significant geopolitical disruptions have tested the resilience of global supply chains. The Red Sea crisis, for example, led to a 56% decline in vessel transits, with most large container ships rerouting around the Cape of Good Hope, which extended Asia–Europe and Asia-US East Coast transit times by up to two weeks.

This disruption primarily affected mainline container vessels, while regional feeder vessels were largely unaffected as they generally operate outside the high-risk corridor. The Cape route increased both shipping costs and operational complexity, highlighting the vulnerability of critical maritime corridors.

As global trade patterns shift and the industry faces new pressures, ports that are able to adapt, communicate clear strategies, and invest in future-proofing their operations will continue to lead and set the pace for the sector’s evolution.

… said Knut Ørbeck-Nilssen, CEO Maritime at DNV.

Role of port authorities in shaping development

Port authorities are instrumental in shaping the growth and development of container ports. By defining long-term visions, leading critical infrastructure development, and implementing forward-thinking regulations, they establish the framework necessary for sustainable growth and innovation.

Such governance creates an enabling ecosystem where terminal operators and ancillary service providers can concentrate on optimising productivity, streamlining operations, and elevating customer experience.

The collaboration between visionary port authorities and agile operators is indispensable, driving continuous advancement and ensuring ports remain adaptable and competitive in a rapidly evolving global landscape.

Alignment with Leading Maritime Cities rankings

It is noteworthy that Singapore, Shanghai, and Rotterdam also consistently rank among the top three in the Leading Maritime Cities rankings, reflecting their continued dominance and influence at both port and city levels.

This alignment further reinforces the comprehensive leadership of these hubs across infrastructure, connectivity, and innovation.

Regional leaders across global maritime markets

The report’s regional benchmarking highlights standout ports shaping maritime trade in their respective regions. Durban is noted for resilience and strategic investment in Africa, while Lome is emerging as a key West African transhipment hub.

Savannah leads the Central and Gulf of America (Gulf of Mexico) region in infrastructure and connectivity, and Colon-Cristobal excels in transhipment in Panama. Mundra leads the Indian subcontinent in terms of automation and productivity, with Colombo serving as the region’s primary transhipment gateway.

Tanger Med is redefining Mediterranean logistics with rapid growth fuelled by its strategic geographic location at the crossroads of the Strait of Gibraltar, serving as a critical entry point to Europe.

In the Middle East, Dubai’s Jebel Ali leads the ranking, while Khalifa Port in Abu Dhabi is recognised for its environmental leadership. Oceania’s leader, Sydney, is recognised for its connectivity and sustainability, while Melbourne is recognised for its overall impact and efficiency.

Importance of balanced performance across all pillars

While the report celebrates the achievements of the overall leaders, it also reveals that excellence in a single indicator, or even within a single pillar, is insufficient for top-tier status.

Several ports emerged as indicator-level champions yet did not secure a place among the top five overall, or in some cases, even within their respective pillars. This underscores the importance of a holistic approach.

True global leadership in the container port sector requires balanced strength across infrastructure, connectivity, operational efficiency, sustainability, and economic impact. Ports may excel in one area, but true competitiveness and resilience come from integrating strengths across all pillars.

The top-performing container ports are both expanding capacity and rethinking how technology shapes daily operations. We see ports where automation and digital tools are woven into every process, from vessel scheduling to cargo handling. Investments in cleaner energy and integrated transport links are also making a difference, helping ports operate more efficiently and adapt to new demands

A report from VesselBot details containership fleet performance during a period of regulatory uncertainty and trade disruptions. The quarterly analysis, titled ""Decoding Maritime Emissions, Q3 2025: Containership Emissions and Traffic on the Rise,"" examined 73,353 containership voyages completed by 4,750 vessels between July and September 2025.

Total containership emissions reached 50.3 million tons in Q3 2025, remaining virtually unchanged (-0.2%) compared to Q3 2024 despite a 2.3% increase in voyages. Average well-to-wake emissions intensity improved to 195.9 g CO2e/TEU km, down 1.6% year-over-year, driven by longer steaming times and reduced port dwell times.

Direct China-U.S. voyages showed pronounced volatility, declining 3% in the first nine months of 2025 but spiking 15% in July before dropping 10% in September. China's retaliatory port fees targeting U.S.-owned, operated, or built vessels introduce additional complexity to carrier deployment strategies.

Well-to-wake emissions intensity varies dramatically by vessel size, from 252.1 g CO2e/TEU km for Feeder vessels (up to 2,999 TEU capacity) to 61.4 for Very Large Container Ships (at least 17,000 TEU capacity). Feeder vessels completed 62.1% of all Q3 voyages yet accounted for only 10.3% of total TEU km, while VLCS completed just 2% of voyages, accounting for 17.2% of total TEU km.

Chinese-built vessels completed 36% of Q3 voyages, while 53.1% of vessels under 5 years old have been built from Chinese shipyards. South Korean-built vessels carried out 24.6% of all Q3 containership voyages, but 41.3% of all VLCS. South Korean built vessels voyages recorded the lowest emissions intensity at 152.7 g CO2e/TEU km due to larger capacities and long-haul trade deployment.

Major fronthaul trades demonstrate the importance of route-level analysis, with Asia-Northern Europe voyages averaging an intensity of 55.3 g CO2e/TEU km and a duration of 30.6 days In contrast, industry-wide average steaming time was only 3.5 days.

The BBC has investigated its history and it offers an illuminating insight into the enigmatic life of a shadow ship.","Out on the western Baltic, a coastguard officer radios a nearby, sanctioned oil tanker.

“Swedish Coastguard calling… Do you consent to answer a few questions for us? Over.”

Through heavy static, barely audible answers crackle over from a crew member, who gradually lists the ship’s insurance details, flag state and last port of call – Suez, Egypt.

“I think this ship will go up to Russia and get oil,” says Swedish investigator, Jonatan Tholin.

This is the front line of Europe’s uneasy standoff with Russia’s so-called “shadow fleet”; a term that commonly refers to hundreds of tankers used to bypass a price cap on Russian oil exports.

After the Kremlin launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, many Western countries imposed sanctions on Russian energy, which Moscow is accused of dodging by shipping oil on aged tankers often with obscure ownership or insurance.

Some “shadow” ships are even suspected of undersea sabotage, illicit drone launches or “spoofing” their location data.

Out on the waves, where freedom of navigation is a golden rule, the ability and appetite of coastal countries to intervene is limited, even though the risk they face is escalating.

As the BBC has learned, a growing network of “shadow” ships are sailing without a valid national flag, which can render vessels stateless and without proper insurance.

That is a troubling trend, given many are practically “floating rust buckets”, says senior maritime intelligence analyst at Windward AI, Michelle Wiese Bockmann. If there is an accident, like a billion-dollar oil spill, “good luck with trying to find somebody responsible to pick up any cost”.

Driven by record sanctions and tighter enforcement, the number of falsely flagged ships globally has more than doubled this year to over 450, most of them tankers, according to the International Maritime Organization (IMO) database.

The BBC has been tracking one ship that appears to have sailed without a valid flag.

The head of Estonia’s navy, Commodore Ivo Värk, says they have seen dozens of such passing vessels this year whereas they used to see just one or two.

The rise is alarming, he tells me, as we talk in his office overlooking the Gulf of Finland, a narrow gateway to the major Russian oil terminals of Ust-Luga and Primorsk.

What’s more, he suggests, it’s brazen: “There’s no secret made about it.”

We spot the tanker Unity on the MarineTraffic app, the day we board an Estonian (British-built) Minehunter that is also used in Nato’s Baltic Sentry patrols to protect critical infrastructure.

Journeying east, Unity is over 100 miles away but sailing in our direction.

The BBC has investigated its history and it offers an illuminating insight into the enigmatic life of a shadow ship.

Tracking data shows that Unity has passed through the English Channel four times in the last twelve months, including journeys between Russian ports and India; a key oil customer that has not signed up to the price cap.

Originally known as Ocean Explorer, the tanker was built in 2009 and flew the flag of Singapore for more than a decade.

Back in 2019, it was named in a UN report for alleged involvement in a ship-to-ship transfer with a vessel that had been sanctioned for its role in transporting fuel to North Korea – which is among other countries also charged with utilising elusive shadow ships.

By late 2021, the vessel – which that year operated under the name Ocean Vela – took the flag of the Marshall Islands but was struck from that list in 2024, a registry spokesperson told us, because the ship’s then-operator and beneficial owning company had been sanctioned by the UK.

The tanker appears to have had three further names since 2021 (Beks Swan, March and Unity) and three further flags (Panama, Russia and Gambia) but always retains a unique IMO number.

In August, ship broadcasting data shows Unity claimed the flag of Lesotho which was designated as “false”. Lesotho is a small, landlocked African enclave kingdom that, according to the IMO, does not have an official registry.

The BBC has tried to contact Unity’s listed owner, a Dubai-registered company called FMTC Ship Charter LLC, but our emails and our calls went unanswered.

The beneficial owners of 60% of shadow fleet vessels remain essentially unknown, according to maritime intelligence company Windward AI.

Opaque ownership structures – and frequent name or flag changes – have become a signature trait of the shadow fleet as a means of avoiding detection.

Purged from reputable registries and having circled the drain of poor-quality alternatives, some ships are now at a point “where they just don’t even bother at all”, says Michelle Wiese Bockmann.

Unity’s most recent journey saw it sail through the North Sea in late October before entering the Baltic and passing countries including Sweden and Estonia – the point at which we spotted it.

By 6 November, it was anchored outside the Russian port of Ust-Luga where it remains at the time of publication.

The tanker was added to the UK and EU’s ever-growing list of sanctioned vessels earlier this year but, like so many others, continues to do business despite other difficulties.

Back in January, it reportedly sheltered in the English Channel after suffering a mechanical failure during a storm. The following August it was reportedly detained at a Russian port due to technical issues and unpaid wages.

Unity is just one of hundreds of vessels subject to UK and EU service and port bans as both London and Brussels try to increase pressure on the Kremlin.

Nevertheless, Russian revenues from crude and oil product sales were $13.1bn (£9.95bn) in October alone, according to the Paris-based International Energy Agency (IEA) – although this was down by $2.3bn when compared with the same month a year ago.

Analysis by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air finds that “shadow” tankers, either sanctioned or suspected, account for 62% of shipped Russian crude oil exports, while China and India are by far the biggest customers for crude, followed by Turkey and the European Union itself.

While politicians talk of toughening action, navy and coastguard officers point out that a country’s power to act fades the further you go out to sea.

The right of innocent passage remains a cornerstone of maritime law, but stateless vessels technically are not entitled to it.

Countries such as France, Finland and Estonia have detained ships, and they can do so where a crime is suspected, however such drastic controls remain a relatively rare event.

“There’s a complexity associated with it,” argues Commodore Ivo Värk. “With the Russian presence next to our borders, the risk of escalation is too high to do it on a regular basis.”

Frans Sanderse

The Estonians speak from experience.

When they attempted to intercept a flagless tanker in May, Russia briefly deployed a fighter jet and has “constantly” had about two naval vessels in the Gulf of Finland since, says Commodore Värk.

The fear of escalation sits alongside broader concerns of commercial retaliation if a more aggressive approach were to be taken.

“Every day in the Baltic, there’s suspicious activity,” a Nato official told the BBC, speaking on the condition of anonymity. Nevertheless, the official added, “we don’t want to be cowboys and jumping on ships. The act of monitoring ships is a deterrent in itself”.

“Freedom of navigation is the lifeblood of all of our economies.”

Back on the bridge of the Swedish coastguard ship, the radio call with the sanctioned tanker has wrapped up.

“Thank you for your co-operation,” says the officer as the vessel carries on towards Russia.

The exchange lasted just over five minutes.

“You need to see it in a larger perspective,” says investigator Jonatan Tholin when I suggest these measures appear less than muscular: “This information can be used in our maritime surveillance.”

But as Europe steps up checks and watches the waves, Windward’s Michelle Wiese Bockmann spies something else: “You can literally see the international rules-based order crumbling through the sanctions-circumventing tactics of these vessels.”

There is a lot at stake for the environment and on security, she says, and meanwhile “the dark fleet is getting darker”.

The BBC approached Russia’s embassy in London for comment. In response, a spokesman said that the West’s “anti-Russian sanctions” were “illegitimate” and “undermine established principles of global commerce”.

“Labelling ships used to export Russian oil as ‘shadow fleet’ is discriminatory and misleading,” the embassy said, and instances of invalid flags were typically down to “easily resolved” issues such as administrative delays.

It was sanctioning countries, the spokesperson said, that had “heightened” the risks by “forcing shipowners and operators to navigate an increasingly fragmented and restrictive regulatory landscape”.

They are equipped with LNG dual-fuel engines and a significantly enlarged fuel tank—expanded by approximately 50%—to enhance operational efficiency.","The global shipping industry is grappling with the dual challenge of increasing transport volumes and an urgent need to decarbonise, transforming its perception of environmental mandates from a threat to a significant opportunity, believes Jason Stefanatos, Global Decarbonization Director, DNV.

During his keynote presentation New Fuels in the Shipping Industry at the IBIA Annual Convention 2025 in Hong Kong on Tuesday (18 November) Stefanatos forecasted a consistent rise in all transport segments, creating a substantial hurdle for an industry such as shipping to reduce its carbon footprint.

While specific figures vary, the overarching trend points to growth, compelling stakeholders to seek innovative solutions. Initially viewed with apprehension, decarbonisation is increasingly seen as a chance for shipowners to differentiate, attract new cargo, and foster closer collaborations with customers.

The following were Stefanatos’ observations:

Fleet Readiness and Future Capacity

Currently, 8.9% of the global fleet is capable of burning alternative marine fuels, with liquified natural gas (LNG) holding the largest share due to its mature infrastructure and technology.

This figure, while seemingly small, represents significant progress in recent years. Looking ahead, the order book paints a more optimistic picture: over half of new vessels on order are designed with alternative fuel capabilities, signalling a substantial future shift.

However, this adoption is not uniform; segments like containerships, cruise liners, and car carriers show high uptake (75-80%), driven by end-users willing to pay a premium for greener products, while bulkers and tankers lag due to different commercial dynamics.

The Looming Fuel Supply Gap

By 2030, based on existing orders and continued ordering rates, the global fleet could theoretically have the capacity to burn nearly 50 million metric tonnes of alternative marine fuels annually. This represents a significant portion compared to the industry’s total annual consumption of 280 million tons.

Yet, a critical challenge emerges on the supply side: under current net-zero frameworks, shipping would require 30% to 60% of the global green fuel production to avoid penalties. This is a stark contrast to shipping’s current 3-4% share of the global energy mix, raising concerns about competition with other sectors and the industry’s ability to secure sufficient green fuel at competitive prices.

Navigating the Alternative Marine Fuels Landscape

There is no single “golden solution” for decarbonisation; each bunker fuel option presents a unique set of technological, economic, safety, availability, and greenhouse gas credentials. The industry is primarily focusing on four key solutions:

LNG: The most mature alternative fuel, with over 1,300 non-LNG carrier vessels already capable of using it and a wide bunkering infrastructure. Its fossil nature and methane slip concerns remain key challenges, though it offers a pathway to renewable natural gas.

Methanol: Valued for its simplicity as a liquid fuel, making port infrastructure development easier and cheaper than for gas fuels. While fossil methanol has worse emissions than Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO), green methanol can meet 2050 targets. Regional dynamics, such as China’s focus on green methanol production, are significantly influencing its uptake, particularly among bulk carriers trading in the region.

Ammonia: A carbon-free molecule, offering the potential for actual zero emissions at the point of combustion. However, its well-to-wake emissions depend heavily on the production pathway, and engine technology is still in development, with major makers expected to deliver engines this or next year.

Biofuels: Offers a “quick fix” with minimal retrofits for compliance. However, their scalability is severely limited by the availability of sustainable biomass, with shipping currently consuming only 0.6% of global biofuels, facing intense competition from road and aviation sectors. The need for flexible chains of custody and robust global certification schemes is crucial to accelerate adoption.

Uncertainty and the Call for Flexibility

“The path forward is marked by persistent uncertainty in regulations, supply chains, and technological advancements. Easy decision-making is not anticipated anytime soon,” concluded Stefanatos.

“Therefore, flexibility is paramount for shipowners, bunker suppliers, and fuel producers alike, recognising the complex interplay between production, distribution, and consumption in this evolving landscape.”

Singapore-based bunker supplier Global Energy Trading Pte Ltd (GET) on Wednesday (26 November) said its journey into methanol bunkering took the first step in 2023 with a ship building contract signed in Japan.

It kicked off in 2024 with the delivery of the company’s first two units of IMO type II chemical tankers, MAPLE and KARA.

GET is one of the three companies that will receive a licence by the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) to supply methanol as a marine fuel in the Port of Singapore. The methanol bunkering licence is valid for five years, commencing from 1 January 2026.

The other two companies are Golden Island Pte Ltd, and PetroChina International (Singapore) Pte Ltd.

The company said the three were picked from a pool of 13 applicants.

“Since taking delivery of the tankers, we have conducted various trial supplies of methanol in Singapore and at Malaysian ports,” GET said in a statement.

“Together with other industry players, we have gathered valuable first-hand experience from handling and supply operations to vessels at the anchorage and to container ships simultaneously during the cargo operations.”

GET has handled bio-methanol, blended bio-methanol and conventional methanol, with the largest parcel at 3,000 metric tonnes (mt).

The Group said it will be taking deliveries of another two units of 8000 DWT tankers in 2026. In the updated design, the ship will have stainless steel tanks for the optimum carriage and storage of methanol.

“While a higher cubic capacity space would ensure the ship to achieve a bigger throughput. This new design also incorporates special features to improve fuel efficiencies.”

“This opportunity accorded by MPA reaffirms Global Energy’s status as a responsible service provider together with other licensee to advance the maritime industry in its decarbonisation efforts under the IMO’s greenhouse gas strategy, EU RED requirements and the FuelEU Maritime Regulations, etc.”

Japanese shipping major NYK on Tuesday (25 November) said its vessel has used 251,017 metric of B24, a blended marine fuel containing 24% second-generation fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) derived from nonfood sources and certified under ISCC.

This comes following the company launching long-term trials aimed at full-scale implementation of biofuel usage in fiscal year (FY) 2024. This marked a significant increase, about 40 times more, over the 6,287 mt used in FY 2023.

The company said this in its latest report, Progress Report 2025 — NYK Group Decarbonization Story (Progress Report 2025), detailing the advances made in the NYK Decarbonization Story (NDS).

In November 2023, the NYK Group announced the NDS, setting ambitious targets: a 45% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030 (compared to FY2021), and net-zero emissions for Scope 1, 2, and 3 by 2050. The company is moving forward with initiatives designed to achieve these goals including the use of alternative fuels such as biofuels.

NYK added it has implemented initiatives in FY2024 to address challenges related to the long-term safe use of biofuels.

The initiatives include development of BioxiGuard, an antioxidant, additive for biofuels and development of Yunic800Eco, a fuel additive designed to improve the stability of blended fuels and enhance fuel efficiency.

Since June 2025, NYK has commenced the continuous use of bio-LNG fuel on its LNG-powered car carriers.

The bio-LNG fuel is supplied by Titan’s bunkering vessel at the Port of Zeebrugge in Belgium.

“Starting with the supply to two vessels—Daisy Leader in June and Sumire Leader in July—we will integrate LNG biofuel into our routine operations,” the company added.

South Korean conglomerate HD Hyundai on Sunday (23 November) said it has secured an order for ultra-large container ships worth around USD 1.46 billion, recording the largest container ship order volume in 18 years since the shipbuilding supercycle in 2007.

HD Korea Shipbuilding & Offshore Engineering (HD KSOE), the intermediate holding company for HD Hyundai’s shipbuilding business, announced that it has signed a shipbuilding contract with Korea-based integrated logistics company HMM for eight 13,400-TEU dual-fuel container ships. The total contract value amounts to USD 1.456 billion.

The vessels ordered are 337 meters in length, 51 meters in width, and 27.9 meters in height. They are equipped with LNG dual-fuel engines and a significantly enlarged fuel tank—expanded by approximately 50%—to enhance operational efficiency. Of the eight vessels, two will be built by HD Hyundai Heavy Industries (HHI) and six by HD Hyundai Samho, with deliveries scheduled consecutively through the first half of 2029.

Through this contract, HD Hyundai said it has achieved its largest container-ship order volume since 2007, when global cargo demand peaked during the economic boom (793,473 TEU). HD KSOE has secured orders for a total of 720,000 TEU (69 vessels) in container ships this year, marking the highest order volume among domestic shipbuilders.

An HD Hyundai representative, said : “We are further solidifying our position in the global market based on advanced technological capabilities and customer trust.

“Going forward, we will continue to lead the decarbonisation of the shipbuilding and shipping industries through technological competitiveness focused on eco-friendly and high-efficiency vessels.”

The IMO’s proposed Net Zero Framework was agreed in principle.

It outlines a global approach to achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions from shipping by or around 2050.The Framework introduces mechanisms that include a global fuel standard to progressively limit the carbon intensity of marine fuels and global emissions pricing, where ships pay levies based on carbon intensity.

“Ships using high carbon fuels should pay US$380 per tonne of CO2 equivalent emissions, while lower carbon exceedances are checked at US$100 per tonne. Ships operating on zero and near-zero NZF fuels would be eligible for rewards through the IMO Net Zero Fund.”

Ro Filipe stated that Fiji, along with the Pacific and the wider Six-Pack Coalition, strongly supported the adoption of the NZF.

However, despite this strong advocacy, the NZF was not adopted.

The decision on the proposed Framework has been deferred by one year (57 votes to 49), reflecting deep divisions over whether it should proceed via the IMO’s long-standing acceptance procedure or require explicit acceptance due to its technical scale and redistributive nature.",https://www.fbcnews.com.fj/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ship-climate.png,N,,2025-11-25 15:58:36.701757

Major maritime nations were in discussions about adopting rules to transition the shipping industry away from fossil fuels to reduce emissions. However, U.S. President Donald Trump, along with Saudi Arabia and other nations, opposed any worldwide tax on shipping emissions.

The U.S. had warned of potential repercussions if countries supported the levy. President Trump encouraged nations to vote “No” at the International Maritime Organization (IMO) headquarters in London, expressing on his social media platform Truth Social that “the United States will not tolerate this global green new scam tax on shipping.”

The IMO, a United Nations agency that oversees international shipping, saw Saudi Arabia calling for a one-year adjournment of the meeting, which was agreed upon by more than half of the member countries.

In response to the decision, Ralph Regenvanu, the climate change minister of Vanuatu, a Pacific island nation, criticized the move as unacceptable given the urgent need to address escalating climate change. If the proposed green shipping regulations had been adopted, it would have marked the first instance of a global fee being imposed on greenhouse gas emissions from ships, which predominantly use heavy fuel oil releasing carbon dioxide and other pollutants when burned.

The delay in implementing the regulations has left the shipping industry in a state of uncertainty. Nonetheless, there is a clear indication of the industry’s willingness to enhance environmental standards, despite facing opposition from the U.S., as noted by Alison Shaw, IMO manager at Transport & Environment, an environmental NGO based in Brussels.

Over the past decade, shipping emissions have surged to approximately three percent of the global total due to increased trade activities and the extensive use of fossil fuels by vessels for long-distance cargo transportation. In April, IMO member states had agreed on a regulatory framework aimed at adopting the “Net-Zero Framework” at the London meeting held this week.

The adoption of these regulations was intended to showcase the effectiveness of multilateral collaboration in achieving tangible progress towards global climate objectives. Emma Fenton, senior director for climate diplomacy at Opportunity Green, a UK-based climate change nonprofit, emphasized that delaying the process jeopardizes the framework’s aspirations.

The proposed regulations would have established a marine fuel standard to gradually reduce greenhouse gas emissions from shipping fuels. Additionally, a pricing mechanism would have been implemented to levy charges for each ton of greenhouse gases emitted by ships exceeding permissible limits, effectively introducing the first global tax on such emissions.

The IMO, which governs international shipping, set a target for the sector to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by around 2050 and is committed to promoting the wider use of fuels with zero or near-zero emissions.

Anaïs Rios, a shipping policy officer for Seas At Risk, urged countries to unite and return to the IMO with a resounding and unwavering “yes” vote that cannot be silenced, stressing the urgency of taking action for the planet and the future of the shipping industry.",https://dailylondontimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/default-267.jpeg,N,,2025-11-26 10:58:05.813863
