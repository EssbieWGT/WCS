Benefits of autonomous ships Autonomous ships offer significant operational advantages reducing human error, lowering crew-related costs and enhancing overall safety.
The advanced AI and sensor systems onboard autonomous ships enable precise navigation and real-time hazard detection, which lead to fewer accidents, thus performing overall safer voyages.
By supporting smarter logistics and reducing unnecessary voyages, autonomous shipping plays a crucial role in meeting global decarbonization goals, ultimately fostering a safer and more sustainable maritime industry.
This regulatory progression not only facilitates innovation but also ensures that autonomous ships integrate seamlessly and safely into the global maritime ecosystem, setting the course for a future where autonomous shipping becomes the industry's new standard.","Autonomous vessels are set to revolutionize the shipping industry, whereby they will gradually and eventually transform global maritime trade through advances in artificial intelligence (AI), sensor technologies and remote operations. As traditional shipping faces ever-growing challenges - from aging fleets to rising safety concerns to ever-increasing environmental rules and regulations - autonomous ships offer a compelling solution that promises increased efficiency and safety whilst simultaneously reducing carbon emissions and operational costs.

Whereas fully unmanned ships remain on the horizon, 2025 marks a pivotal milestone as semi-autonomous ships enter practical commercial service, leveraging remote control centres and advanced AI-driven navigation to optimise routs, enhance situational awareness and mitigate human error. Supported by regulatory frameworks and rapid technological advancements, autonomous shipping is set to become a cornerstone of the maritime industry, ushering in a new era where intelligent machines and human oversight work cohesively to redefine how goods move across our oceans.

The IMO's involvement

For the past few years, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has already been laying the groundwork for the eventual widespread introduction of autonomous ships into the shipping industry. The aim of the IMO is to regulate new and advancing technologies through its framework, whereby they seek to balance the benefits from said technologies against concerns of security and safety, the impact on the environment and on the facilitation of international trade, the potential costs to the shipping industry and their impact on personnel, both onboard and on shore. IMO wants to ensure the framework regulating Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships (MASS) keeps up the rapidly evolving technological developments.

Following the completion of the IMO's scoping exercise on MASS back in 2021, the main goal of which was to assess which existing IMO instruments could apply to ships of varying degrees of automation, the Maritime Safety Committee (MSC), through its 109th session, agreed to a revised roadmap for the development of an official MASS Code.

The scoping exercise covered four degrees of autonomy regarding MASS, these being:

1. Ships with automated processes and decision support systems. Seafarers are still present onboard to operate and control the ship's systems and functions. Certain operations may be automated and at times unsupervised, with seafarers onboard ready to take control in case of malfunctions or errors.

2. Remote-controlled ships with seafarers on board. The ship is controlled and operated from another location whereby seafarers are available onboard to take and operate the ship's systems and functions.

3. Remote-controlled ships without seafarers onboard. The ship is controlled from another location without the presence of the human element onboard.

4. Fully autonomous ships. The operating system of these ships would be able to make decisions and determine specific actions by itself.

The outcome of this scoping exercise highlighted a number of critical issues which were present across several of the IMO's instruments, whereby these involved the creation of MASS terminology and definitions, including an internationally agreed definition of MASS and clarification on the definitions of ""master"", ""crew"" and ""responsible person"", particularly in Degrees Three (remote-controlled ships) and Four (fully autonomous ships) as described earlier.

Other key issues identified included the need to address the functional and operational requirements of the remote-control station/centre and the possible designation of a remote operator as seafarer. Further potential gaps that were identified related to manual operations and alarms on the bridge, provisions related to actions by personnel such as firefighting, cargo stowage and securing, maintenance, search and rescue, watchkeeping and information required to be kept onboard for safe operation of the ship.

At the following session, at MSC 110, the abovementioned roadmap was fine-tuned and the committee agreed on the following milestones:

MSC 111 (scheduled for May 2026) will aim to finalise and adopt the non-mandatory MASS Code;

MSC 112 (scheduled for December 2026) will seek to develop a framework for the Experience-Building Phase (EBP) of MASS;

The IMO plans to kickstart development of the mandatory MASS Code in 2028, based on the non-mandatory MASS Code and results from the EBP;

By 1st July 2030 at the latest, the goal is to have widespread adoption of the mandatory MASS Code, whilst its entry into force is scheduled for 1st January 2032, at the earliest.

It is important to keep in mind that the non-mandatory MASS will merely act as a supplement to The International Convention on the Safety of Life At Sea (SOLAS) and that its entry into force will not automatically relax any of the requirements as laid out under the latter. Exemptions from the requirements of SOLAS must be agreed upon by the flag State during the approval process of the non-mandatory MASS Code.

Key issues that are yet to be addressed are the roles and responsibilities of both the master and the remote operator, general questions surrounding liability and the onboard carriage of certificates. The IMO determined that its internal committees are to discuss these issues at future meetings before taking an official position on the way forward, seeing as this will affect the global shipping industry.

Benefits of autonomous ships

Autonomous ships offer significant operational advantages reducing human error, lowering crew-related costs and enhancing overall safety. One of the biggest achievements would be mitigation of human error, seeing as it is the cause behind 96% of all maritime incidents. The advanced AI and sensor systems onboard autonomous ships enable precise navigation and real-time hazard detection, which lead to fewer accidents, thus performing overall safer voyages.

Moreover, autonomous vessels optimize route planning and engine performance, ensuring improved fuel efficiency and reduced operating costs. The reduction, and eventual elimination of onboard crew requirements not only cuts costs of labour but also allows ships to be designed with more cargo space, further enhancing economic viability.

On the environmental front, autonomous ships contribute to cleaner maritime operations by minimizing fuel consumption through optimized navigation and the integration of alternative, low-emission fuels. These vessels are equipped with sophisticated monitoring systems that swiftly detect and mitigate environmental risks such as oil spills or leaks. By supporting smarter logistics and reducing unnecessary voyages, autonomous shipping plays a crucial role in meeting global decarbonization goals, ultimately fostering a safer and more sustainable maritime industry.

Autonomous ships, by virtue of their advanced automation and optimized operation, are estimated to significantly reduce fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, thereby aligning with European Union's (EU) stringent emission reduction targets, one of these being the EU Emission Trading System (EU ETS).

EU ETS, which operates on a cap-and-trade principle, enables shipping companies buy and sell allowances for their emissions, meaning that autonomous vessels could benefit from lower allowance costs due to their cleaner operations. This creates an incentive for shipping operators to adopt MASS technologies, as the reduced emissions directly translate into fewer allowances needed and thus, lower compliance costs and aligning with the market-driven push towards a globally greener shipping sector.

Furthermore, the EU's ongoing integration of carbon removal technologies highlights a broader policy environment where innovations like MASS can contribute significantly to achieving ambitious net-zero goals while benefiting from and contributing to a sustainable, market-based climate policy system.

The pitfalls of autonomy

Autonomous ships, whilst offering revolutionary benefits, come with significant challenges that must be addressed to ensure their safe and reliable integration into the maritime industry. One of the foremost concerns is cybersecurity. These vessels, being heavily dependent on digital communication and automated control systems, are vulnerable to sophisticated cyberattacks.

Such breaches could disrupt navigation, impair situational awareness or even hijack control of the ship, potentially leading to collisions, environmental disasters or theft of cargo. Given the complexity of integrating operational technology with information technology systems, the security framework for autonomous ships requires robust design, continuous monitoring, and real-time anomaly detection to effectively mitigate these risks.

Operationally, autonomous vessels face technical and regulatory pitfalls. The reliability of AI in interpreting complex and unpredictable maritime environments remains a challenge, especially under adverse weather or congested port conditions. Additionally, the legal landscape has yet to fully catch up, with ambiguities surrounding insurance coverage and compliance with international maritime conventions.

The human element also plays a major role as the transition to autonomous operations confronts resistance from seafarers concerned about job security and highlights the need for new training paradigms for remote operators and shore-based personnel. Lastly, the high upfront investment costs and the infrastructural changes required to accommodate autonomous ships add layers of financial and logistical complexity that may slow widespread adoption. Overall, these challenges call for a cautious, phased implementation strategy coupled with ongoing technological innovation and international regulatory cooperation.

Conclusion

The rise of autonomous vessels represents a transformative leap for the shipping industry, bringing with it promises to enhance safety, efficiency and environmental sustainability whilst simultaneously reshaping fundamental operational standards and principles. Central to this evolution is the proactive role of the IMO in developing a comprehensive regulatory framework tailored to MASS.

With the IMO's ongoing efforts culminating in the forthcoming MASS Code, regulations are being crafted to address critical aspects such as navigation autonomy, safety management, liability and crew responsibilities both in remote and in fully autonomous operations. This regulatory progression not only facilitates innovation but also ensures that autonomous ships integrate seamlessly and safely into the global maritime ecosystem, setting the course for a future where autonomous shipping becomes the industry's new standard.

One of the IMO's principal goals is the commitment to achieve net-zero emissions by about 2050, in tandem with interim goals for reducing the carbon footprint in shipping.

Malaysia prioritises the adoption of low-carbon technology and fuels, including liquefied natural gas (LNG), biofuels, and hydrogen, in order to accomplish fleet carbon reductions.

We seek to decrease our maritime carbon footprint by incentivising shipowners to retrofit vessels with energy-efficient designs and alternative propulsion systems, consequently complying with the IMO's Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index and Carbon Intensity Indicator requirements.

As a key player in Southeast Asia's trade routes, Malaysia has the potential to leverage this role to align national policies with IMO objectives, therefore assuring sustainability, safety, and competitiveness in an evolving global shipping environment.

The upcoming Malaysia Maritime Masterplan 2026–2040, scheduled for launch next year, will serve as a framework for changing the nation's marine industry into a resilient, sustainable, and competitive structure.

From an academic perspective, the 2026–2040 framework represents our most concerted effort to synchronise maritime governance, infrastructure modernisation, and blue economy development.

It builds upon lessons learnt from the Malaysia Shipping Master Plan 2017–2022 (MSMP), which strengthened fleet competitiveness, promoted regulatory transparency, and cultivated maritime human capital.

While the MSMP achieved significant progress, challenges remained in ship financing, port integration, innovation adoption, and workforce sustainability, all of which are being addressed under the new masterplan.

The Maritime Masterplan integrates climate action and low-carbon initiatives into domestic shipping operations.

This not only aligns with IMO's environmental guidelines but also establishes Malaysia as a leader in sustainable shipping within Asean, attracting environmentally-aware multinational carriers and decreasing operational costs via enhanced efficiency.

Maritime safety is also among the fundamental objectives of the masterplan, with continuous initiatives aimed at accident prevention, piracy and robbery suppression, and the welfare of seafarers.

In order to stay competitive, Malaysia's plans emphasise digitalisation and trade facilitation to preserve its competitive advantage.

The masterplan emphasises human capital development, targeting the specialised training of maritime professionals in digital competencies, maritime cybersecurity, and sustainable operations, targeting the global deficit of proficient seafarers.

By cultivating a skilled workforce, Malaysia guarantees that its shipping industry stays adaptable in the face of technology challenges, like autonomous boats and AI-driven operations.

Malaysia's dedication to the Women in Maritime initiative is equally vital, aligning with the IMO's enduring goal of enhancing female representation within the industry.

We seek to develop a more diverse, innovative, and future-ready maritime workforce by enhancing educational opportunities, advancing leadership programmes and enacting gender-inclusive policies at work.

The masterplan advocates for the blue economy, utilising marine resources to foster sustainable development in sectors like aquaculture, offshore renewable energy, and tourism.

This comprehensive strategy fulfils IMO objectives and bolsters Malaysia's competitiveness by attracting foreign direct investment, generating employment, and augmenting its participation in global trade volumes.

With Malaysia's accession to the IMO Council, the launching of the Maritime Masterplan in 2026 is timely.

This comprehensive 15-year strategy outlines a framework for addressing issues such as geopolitical conflicts, climate change, and technology advancements, while leveraging opportunities in global commerce.

The S&P 500 gained 0.31%, continuing the divergence between broader markets and LNG shipping stocks. Trading volume hit a record high, signalling strong investor engagement at this crucial technical level.

New Fortress Energy led gains with a 29% surge, while Korea Line Corporation jumped 14% on very high volume, breaking out of its summer sideways range. On the downside, COSCO Shipping Energy Transportation fell 5.3% to support levels. Natural gas prices continue to diverge: Asian JKM declined to $10.66/mmBtu—near the threshold that attracts smaller buyers—while Henry Hub surpassed $5/mmBtu. Despite fundamentals remaining robust, with Atlantic spot rates at $130,000/day, most companies now stand on the cusp of change, testing support levels that will determine the sector’s next direction.

UPI & SPX

The UP World LNG Shipping Index, which tracks listed LNG shipping companies, lost 1.70 points (1.05%), closing at 160.72 points, while the S&P 500 index gained 0.31%. The chart below illustrates the performance of both indices with weekly data.

Broader View

UPI has reached its long-term support level, similar to the end of 2023, when growth in the final weeks of the year pushed the index into positive territory. We will discuss this topic in more detail in the Chart of the Week on our website.

The price of natural gas for Asia is declining slowly, while it is declining more rapidly for Europe. This is due to warmer weather. Interestingly, the price of US gas (Henry Hub) is rising and has surpassed $5 per mmBtu. The price of January deliveries to Asia dropped from $10.90/mmBtu to $10.66/mmBtu, which, according to Argus Media, is close to the threshold that attracts smaller Asian buyers. According to S&P Global Energy, the daily reference price for January deliveries to Western Europe (NWM), based on ex-ship (DES), is $8.787/mmBtu, representing a $0.45/mmBtu discount compared to the price at the TTF hub. Daily spot prices for LNG tankers remain at $130,000 for the Atlantic and $87,500 for the Pacific, according to Spark Commodities.

The declining price of gas will boost demand, but shipping company shares are dropping. One reason is the limited influence of spot rates on fleets mainly operating under long-term contracts.

The ratio of declining to rising companies from UPI was 12:9, with a median movement of -0.26%. Trading volume reached a record high.

Constituents

The declines were not significant, remaining below 2%, with many less than half a per cent. However, COSCO Shipping Energy Transportation (SS: 600026) experienced the most severe loss, falling by 5.3%. The price reached a support level amid increased volume, and the coming weeks will determine the next direction.

The second company with a loss beginning with a two is NYK Line (TSE: 9101). Here, the loss was 2.4%. Despite this decline, the share price remains above support, although only just.

Awilco LNG (OSE: ALNG) and Exmar (BSE: EXM) recorded almost identical losses, differing by one hundredth of a per cent. These were 1.37% and 1.38%, respectively. Nevertheless, Awilco seems to be poised for more significant growth for the second week in a row, while Exmar is moving sideways.

In percentage terms, further changes are not significant, but one group demonstrates a broader trend. This primarily involves the ongoing movement towards support levels of individual companies. This applies to MISC (KLSE: 3816), Mitsui O.S.K. Lines (TSE: 9104), “K” Line (TSE: 9107), Chevron (NYSE: CVX), and Shell (NYSE: SHEL).

Among the rising companies, New Fortress Energy (NYQ: NFE) once again led with a nearly 29% increase, while Korea Line Corporation (KRX: 005880) rose by almost 14%. KLC broke out of its sideways trend on very high volume and nearly reached the highest prices within its sideways trading range since the summer.

Adnoc L&S (ADX: ADNOCLS) rose nearly 5%, trying to sustain its growth trend after a correction.

Dynagas LNG Partners (NYSE: DLNG) made another attempt to rebound from support, rising 4.17%. It has not yet broken through the range.

Golar LNG (NYQ: GLNG) increased for the second consecutive week, returning to its previously broken support level. The rise was 3.6%.

Excelerate Energy (NYQ: EE) made a cautious attempt at growth, rising above the primary resistance zone, which is a price level that has not been sustained. The increase was 2.1%.

Nakilat (QSE: QGTS) remains in the support area but records a 0.5% growth.

The overall impression of the individual companies is therefore not negative, but they are on the cusp of change. However, strong fundamentals do not justify a long-term break through support levels; quite the opposite.

Crystal Ball

The late-summer rise was rejected, and UPI returned to its previous range, where it now trades. This area provides firm support. In the short term, we estimate a rise in volatility of UPI´s constituents.

The initiative aims to drive coordinated research, investment and deployment across industries with high emissions.

A Strategic Push for Hard-to-Abate Sectors

The roadmap focuses on sectors such as cement, power and steel—areas where emissions are difficult to reduce with conventional methods. By promoting CCUS, India aims to develop scalable solutions that can extract, utilise or store carbon dioxide generated from industrial and energy systems.

Government Funding and Institutional Support

Launched by the Principal Scientific Adviser Ajay Kumar Sood, the initiative will draw from the government’s ₹1 lakh crore Research, Development and Innovation funding pathways. This support is expected to accelerate breakthroughs and reduce technology-deployment timelines. Earlier this year, the government also announced five CCU testbeds in the cement sector to create a research cluster for industrial decarbonisation.

How CCUS Works and Global Debate

CCUS includes processes that separate CO₂, compress and transport it, and inject it into geological formations for permanent storage. Alternatively, captured CO₂ may be reused as feedstock for industrial products. While CCUS is widely viewed as essential for net-zero transitions, some experts warn it may prolong fossil fuel dependence and add greenhouse emissions if not deployed carefully.

Shipping is becoming more complex, and Anglo-Eastern is responding with it. 2025 brought significant uncertainty, with changing regulations and tariffs being the biggest topics. Anglo-Eastern reflagged certain vessels in response to tariffs, though always at the owner’s discretion.

The company manages more than 50 dual-fuel vessels of various fuels, with 87 under newbuilding and project management. Highlights include Windcat Rotterdam (IMO: 9995337), a next-generation offshore support vessel, as well as the first wind-assisted aframax, Brands Hatch (IMO: 1034199), and two ammonia-ready newcastlemaxes.

In 2025, Anglo-Eastern launched Sustainability and Performance Services, combining environmental compliance and performance services to help owners, charterers and operators. It boasts that its tools have saved a combined 225,000 tonnes of fuel, or $135m.

Anglo-Eastern set a 2030 target for 30% of its officers to be promoted to management before turning 30, to speed up certifications earlier in their careers.

02 / Tommy Olofsen, OSM Thome

Norway’s OSM Thome heads into 2026 under the new leadership of group managing director Tommy Olofsen, following the retirement in November 2025 of chief executive Finn Amund Norbye.

The 2023 mega-merger of OSM Maritime Group and Singapore’s Thome Ship Management created a giant with more than 1,000 ships under management, employing some 30,000 seafarers, from 20 offices around the world.

Asset manager Oaktree, which bought into OSM Maritime Group in 2018, sold its stake to JP Morgan Asset Management in August. OSM founder Bjørn Tore Larsen and Skagerak Holding, owned by the Eek Thorstensen family that founded Thome, continue to have “significant ownership stakes” in OSM Thome.

03 / René Kofod-Olsen, V.Group

René Kofod-Olsen takes issue with calling V.Group a mere technical manager, preferring “global shipping services company”. What matters is not the number of ships under management, he says, but “the quality that we are delivering on those ships”.

That said, with 900 ships in its fleet — and sizeable services and digital divisions expected to stand on their own two feet — V.Group is in a good position.

Kofod-Olsen says scale is increasingly important in his business as the industry gets more complex. Shipmanagers running 50 or fewer ships are fighting an uphill battle, he warned in November 2025.

V.Group is working with tanker company International Seaways to make ships more female-friendly. Kofod-Olsen said diversity was a “must-win battle for the entire industry”.

04 / Jesper Kristensen, Synergy Marine

Jesper Kristensen joined as Synergy’s group chief executive in March, after 34 years at Unifeeder, and succeeding long-time leader Rajesh Unni.

Company highlights over the past 12 months included a carbon capture refit on an LR1 tanker, one of the first in its class, and converting a 30-year-old liquefied natural gas carrier into a modern floating storage and regasification unit.

The company is expanding into managing methanol-fuelled containerships for an Asian shipowner and formed a joint venture with a Norwegian operator of geared bulkers.

A sea training institute in India will open in 2026 with capacity for 500 trainees a year. The group also expects more consolidation among mid-tier managers as compliance, digital and ESG requirements intensify.

05 / Sebastian von Hardenberg, Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement

Hamburg-based BSM strengthened its expertise in the LNG segment, when its LNG specialty arm Pronav took on management of the FSRU Turquoise P (IMO: 9823883) in the Aegean Sea near Izmir, Turkey.

BSM took on the first methanol vessel, has 50 ships with LNG engines, and announced it will manage the world’s first ammonia bunkering vessel.

It has six maritime training centres — the most recent opened in Ghana in August — as well as 10 shipmanagement centres and 28 crew service centres. The company employs 40,000 crew and 2,000 people on shore.

06 / Rajalingam Subramaniam, Fleet Management

Fleet Management is part of Hong Kong’s Caravel Group, led by commodity trading legend Harry Banga and his son Angad Banga.

2025 was its first year under managing director Rajalingam Subramaniam, who joined from Malaysian shipowner MISC in January.

It opened its first Athens office that month, and in March acquired the International Maritime Institute, a training centre in Noida, India. It is expanding in Japan and the Philippines, where it opened an enlarged crewing and training facility in the capital Manila.

The company has 620 ships under technical management (300 bulkers, 220 tankers and 100 containerships and PCTCS), with another 130 newbuildings in the pipeline.

07 / Mark O’Neil, Columbia

Columbia Group has expanded across its integrated maritime, logistics, leisure, and energy and offshore services platform in 2025.

The company got into the FuelEU Maritime pooling business through its EmissionsLink platform, hoping to capitalise on confusion over emissions rules — especially since the International Maritime Organization Net-Zero Framework delay, which the company warned could lead to overlapping regional rules.

Columbia formed a JV in 2025 with Egypt’s Pan Marine Shipping Services, saying this will let it work more closely with local talent and institutions.

08 / Haakon Lenz, Wilhelmsen Ship Management

Norway’s Wilhelmsen Ship Management, celebrating its 50th anniversary in 2025, is now under the leadership of Haakon Lenz, following the retirement of chief executive Carl Schou.

The company has come a long way since it was born out of the Hong Kong liner service Barber Blue Seas in 1975.

Lenz has said having just over 300 vessels is about where the company needs to be, if it is to make the most of efficiencies while keeping in touch with customers and seafarers.

The company hopes to convince owners of the benefits of third-party shipmanagement by helping deal with more complicated regulations.

09 / Guo Jinkui, Seacon Shipping Group

China’s Seacon Shipping has continued to grow steadily, with notable progress in crew-only management in 2025. The company attributes this to enhanced crew training, especially for LNG and car carriers.

The company has also got into the ship leasing business, acquiring 40% of CIMC Xinde Leasing, and establishing the first FuelEU compliance pool in China.

Seacon says it has also recently developed a “Seacon-AI” model to enhance its capability and efficiency. Approval from the China Classification Society has also been gained for its new shipmanagement software platform.

Hong Kong-based Wallem celebrated 100 years of being based in the city, where it moved 22 years after its founding in Norway by shipbroker and agent Haakon ‘Typhoon’ Wallem in 1903.

Wallem plans to stick around in Hong Kong for another century by prioritising safety, quality and sustainable growth while adapting to technological changes and decarbonisation.

The company has been owned since 2006 by Tom Steckmest, the founder’s great-grandson, and Nigel Hill, Wallem’s current chairman.

A tightening global supply of trained seafarers could affect recruitment, increase operational costs and complicate the adoption of alternative fuels across the Cyprus-managed fleet.","The global shipping industry is facing an escalating human-resources crisis as more seafarers leave life at sea for work ashore, according to reporting by Paul Bartlett, who noted during a COP30 side-event titled ‘The Global Seafarer Emergency’ that the trend now threatens the safe operation of the fleet carrying more than 80 per cent of world trade.

Growing dissatisfaction among crews reflects a familiar list of pressures, bullying, discrimination, excessive working hours, fatigue, little or no shore leave and limited connectivity with family and friends.

In many cases, contracts are extended for months, contributing to sustained physical and psychological strain.

At the webinar, Lloyd’s Register Chief Marketing Officer Philippa Charlton said shipping underpins global trade across containers, dry and liquid cargo, and gases.

She added that the sector’s shift to low- and zero-carbon fuels requires extensive new training in methanol, ammonia and hydrogen for both new recruits and existing seafarers.

Lloyd’s Register Foundation Chief Executive Ruth Boumphrey outlined the scale of the challenge.

Around 1.9 million seafarers currently work on 112,500 merchant ships worldwide, with half coming from the Asia-Pacific region, 33 per cent from Europe and 4 per cent from Africa, while women account for just 1.3 per cent of the global workforce.

She also noted that 64 per cent have not received any training on decarbonisation or new fuels over the past two years. By 2030, an estimated 450,000 will require specialist training, rising to 800,000 thereafter.

Recent data elsewhere reinforce the seriousness of the situation.

The International Chamber of Shipping estimates the global seafaring workforce at 1,892,720, while a Drewry forecast points to a shortage of senior officers reaching 10 per cent by 2030 due to fleet expansion, early retirements and limited new entry.

Surveys also show deteriorating conditions: one 2025 study found 42 per cent of seafarers plan to retire early, with many reporting delayed or incomplete wage payments.

Meanwhile, the ITF recorded a 30 per cent surge in abandonment cases in 2025, with more than 2,286 seafarers stranded on 222 vessels.

A report by the Global Maritime Forum warned that labour shortages have reached a 17-year high, threatening the resilience of global supply chains.

Capt Stylianos Dimouleas, founder of Almi Tankers and a former seafarer, highlighted the pressures crews face during geopolitical tensions and regional conflicts.

Welfare and wellbeing, he said, must form part of management systems, adding that digital connectivity “is a right, not a benefit”.

He also noted that leadership and management training for senior officers helps strengthen safety culture across fleets.

The implications extend far beyond the ships themselves, particularly for countries with large maritime clusters.

Cyprus, one of the world’s top three ship-management hubs, relies heavily on internationally sourced seafarers to operate the vessels under its management.

According to the Chambers Global Practice Guide, Cyprus is the largest third-party ship-management centre in Europe.

More than 200 shipping-related companies are active on the island, employing around 55,000 seafarers worldwide. Recent financial data show ship-management revenues in Cyprus reached €978 million in the first half of 2025, with crew-related costs accounting for 66 per cent of total expenses, emphasising the industry’s dependence on an increasingly strained global workforce.

For Cyprus, whose maritime priorities will feature prominently during its EU Council Presidency in 2026, the growing labour drain at sea intersects directly with the sector’s decarbonisation and safety objectives.

A tightening global supply of trained seafarers could affect recruitment, increase operational costs and complicate the adoption of alternative fuels across the Cyprus-managed fleet.

Taken together, the accelerating exodus from seafaring, the widening training gap and the rise in abandonment cases demonstrate a sector under significant stress at a critical moment.",,N,,2025-12-09 06:56:10.035187

Looking ahead The one-year postponement offers maritime companies a window, but not a waiver.","A key global decarbonization milestone for maritime shipping has been postponed. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) voted during its October meeting to defer, opens new tab by one year a decision on the much-anticipated Net-Zero Framework, opens new tab, an industry-wide regulatory regime intended to require binding greenhouse-gas (GHG) standards and a global carbon pricing mechanism for shipping.

The delay leaves the shipping sector in regulatory limbo even as companies, investors, and insurers press ahead with net-zero goals. It also raises fresh questions for legal, commercial, and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) teams about how to keep decarbonization strategies on track while expectations for formal regulation remain unsettled.

What the framework would have done

Although formal adoption has been pushed back, the framework previously negotiated by IMO member states remains a useful roadmap. Under the terms agreed in April 2025, the package would have introduced a dual system combining a fuel-intensity standard and a market-based compliance mechanism.

Ships of 5,000 gross tons and above, representing roughly 85% of global shipping emissions, would have been required to limit the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted per unit of energy. Vessels exceeding that threshold would either purchase Remedial Units (RUs) or pay a carbon fee, while ships outperforming the standard would earn Surplus Units (SUs) that could be banked or traded. Earlier drafts pegged the fees at about $100 per metric ton of CO2-equivalent for lower-tier breaches and $380 per ton for more severe noncompliance.

Revenues from those charges were slated to flow into a new IMO Net-Zero Fund, projected to raise $11–12 billion annually between 2028 and 2030. The fund would finance alternative fuel infrastructure, energy efficiency retrofits, and capacity building assistance for developing and small-island states.

The rule’s first compliance period was expected to begin around 2027 or 2028, giving the industry a limited window to adapt before obligations formally took effect.

Impacts of the delayed vote

The one-year postponement carries significant implications for maritime stakeholders, affecting investment timelines, compliance planning, and ESG accountability.

Alternative-fuel initiatives such as ammonia, methanol, and hydrogen bunkering depend on a predictable regulatory environment to attract capital and scale infrastructure. Without clear long-term rules in place, financing and deployment are likely to slow as investors reassess the commercial case for cleaner fuels.

For companies that had already begun preparing for the IMO framework, whether through carbon pricing models, fuel switch strategies, or contract revisions, the pause introduces uncertainty rather than relief. The underlying legal and operational architecture remains essential, but the absence of a firm regulatory anchor means planning must now account for a wider range of potential outcomes.

At the same time, ESG and litigation risks persist. Many carriers and logistics providers have set voluntary net-zero targets, and those commitments remain subject to investor scrutiny regardless of regulatory delays. If tangible progress lags behind public pledges, companies may face allegations of greenwashing or misrepresentation, particularly as disclosure standards tighten across jurisdictions.

The delay also increases the likelihood of regional fragmentation. In the absence of a single global standard, jurisdictions such as the European Union and the United Kingdom are advancing their own maritime carbon pricing systems, and others may follow. The resulting patchwork could complicate compliance for global operators and create uneven cost structures until an international framework is ultimately adopted.

What maritime stakeholders can do now

While the IMO finalizes its approach, maritime companies, financiers, and legal advisers can treat this interim period as a strategic window to strengthen compliance foundations, enhance operational resilience, and position themselves for long-term advantage in the event global rules do take effect. Stakeholders should focus in on the following areas.

Fuel strategy and contract readiness

Maritime companies should assess each vessel’s fuel intensity baseline, modeling alternative fuel scenarios and incorporating carbon compliance provisions into charterparties, ship management contracts, and fuel supply agreements. Clear terms on emissions liability, audit rights, and cost allocation will be critical as carbon performance becomes a defining commercial metric.

At the same time, early investment in low-carbon fuel partnerships (e.g., green ammonia, methanol, bio-LNG) and infrastructure projects can help operators manage future price volatility, mitigate regulatory risk, and secure a competitive advantage as the industry moves toward decarbonization.

Data monitoring and verification systems

Effective decarbonization requires rigor. Firms should consider deploying or upgrading emissions monitoring systems, fuel consumption analytics, voyage optimization software, and third-party verification protocols. Transparency will be a major target for investor and litigation scrutiny.

Disclosure, governance, and ESG alignment

Board-level oversight of climate strategy now overlaps directly with compliance risk. Legal teams should ensure that emissions and other ESG disclosures reflect credible transition pathways. Misstatements or overly optimistic timelines may expose firms to fiduciary duty or securities law claims.

Scenario planning and carbon price readiness

Even absent formal regulation, companies should stress-test multiple carbon price trajectories, fuel availability timelines, and compliance cost impacts. Legal counsel should prepare for a scenario in which IMO pricing reemerges in 2026 at higher levels than initially projected. Risk mitigation strategies may include hedging, alternative fuel leases, or early vessel retirement strategies.

Regional regimes and supply chain exposure

Firms should continue monitoring regional regimes and the demands of supply chain actors for low-carbon shipping services. Legal teams should evaluate risks of indirect exposure through charters with cargo owners, scope 3 disclosure obligations, and contractual carveouts for non-compliant vessels.

Transition opportunities and ESG takeaways

Although the framework delay is a setback for regulatory clarity, it does not change the decarbonization direction: The maritime shipping industry’s emissions matter, and ESG stakeholders are watching. Companies that continue advancing their transition plans now will be better positioned to meet investor expectations, secure financing, and shape the rules once they arrive.

Early movers stand to gain a distinct advantage by investing in alternative fuel access, low-carbon vessels, and fuel contract strategies that appeal to cargo owners and financiers. Proactively upgrading monitoring systems, contracts, and fuel arrangements can also reduce future stranded-asset risk and potential litigation exposure.

Additionally, demonstrating measurable progress through credible data, retrofits, and low-carbon commitments can help build stakeholder confidence, reinforce ESG credibility, and keep companies aligned with net-zero targets even before formal regulation takes effect.

Looking ahead

The one-year postponement offers maritime companies a window, but not a waiver. Stakeholders should treat this period not as a pause but as a preparation phase. The next IMO session (expected around October 2026) will likely revisit the framework. When that happens, the baseline for compliance may shift, meaning strategic readiness today will be key to risk mitigation in the future.

Legal, finance, and operations teams should synchronize efforts now on modeling scenarios, negotiating contracts, mapping fuel supply access, strengthening disclosure and governance, and ramping up efficiency programs.",,N,,2025-12-09 06:56:16.188289

She added: “I’m not just talking about airlines here, I’m talking about the fuel suppliers, so the oil and gas companies, which are dragging their heels on producing sustainable aviation fuel.

Progress would rely on “how quickly they can enrol contracts, depending upon the projects that come forward”, he said, but insisted: “There will be more momentum around RCM this time next year, and I think we’ll be much more developed in terms of our thinking and government’s thinking as well as the greenhouse gas removals market.”

Aviation Environment Federation policy manager Celeste Hicks agreed: “We’re not sure whether that means contracts being awarded at the end of next year, but that’s the idea. That will give us an indication of whether we’re going to hit the 2030 SAF targets.”

But she said she also expected to see “delay and increased international aviation emissions” over the next 12 months, and accused the industry as a whole of “dragging its heels” on the production of sustainable aviation fuel.

She added: “I’m not just talking about airlines here, I’m talking about the fuel suppliers, so the oil and gas companies, which are dragging their heels on producing sustainable aviation fuel. The airline manufacturers, so Boeing and Airbus, are also dragging their heels on developing new aircraft.

“Everybody’s dragging their heels. It’s easy for everybody to blame each other, but we don’t see the progress.”

Carnival UK vice-president sustainability and strategy Sophie Portlock was hopeful of progress in 2026 towards an International Maritime Organisation (IMO) deal to reduce carbon emissions globally to reach net zero by 2050, despite talks falling apart earlier this year.

Referring to a one year delay to a vote on adopting a global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions pricing mechanism for international shipping, she said: “It will be interesting to see what happens as a result of the IMO discussions around the net zero framework.”

She stressed the deal had not been “discarded”, adding: “It’s just been delayed by a year. That vote is now due to take place in October next year, and over the coming 12 months, there is work that is going to be done to look at some of these technical challenges and how we overcome some of those within that framework.”

While cruise only makes up 2% of the international shipping industry, ensuring alignment in the move to alternative fuels was “key” to provide confidence and clarity in the market, she stressed.

Carnival Corporation had already seen an 11% reduction in its total greenhouse gasses since a peak in 2011 following investment in energy efficiency measures and new technology, despite a 38% capacity increase over the same period of time, she said.

“That shows how these initiatives and these developments are leading to a reduction in our total carbon footprint,” she said, adding Carnival Corporation had 11 ships operating on liquefied natural gas (LNG), with 18 due to have LNG by 2033, covering around a third of total passenger capacity.

She added more than 70% of the group’s fleet had shore power capability but said the challenge in Europe was the number of available ports.

“There are about 16 ports that have shore power capability that can support cruise ships of our size,” she said, but noted: “We are expecting to see a further seven ports of a shore power capability next year. So it is increasing.”",https://dcxnozgahgy2a.cloudfront.net/AcuCustom/Sitename/DAM/384/Tim_Alderslade_sustainability_summit1_Main.webp,N,,2025-12-08 06:56:11.483555

GCMD said the findings matter as the analysis captures the full distribution of observed power savings linked to wind conditions rather than relying on a single aggregated value.
The system also integrates intelligent sensing and automatic control to adjust rotor operation based on real-time wind conditions, maximizing wind propulsion efficiency, while maintaining safety.
“The stage is set for the next phase of the maritime energy transition,” said Knut Ørbeck-Nilssen, CEO of DNV Maritime.","The Global Centre for Maritime Decarbonisation (GCMD) on Friday (5 December) said it implemented a Wind Assisted Propulsion Systems (WAPS) performance monitoring method with Singapore-based Eastern Pacific Shipping Pte Ltd (EPS) to measure suction sails’ performance on tanker Pacific Sentinel.

GCMD said WAPS are gaining traction as an important decarbonisation lever, but uptake is still far below what is needed to meet regulatory targets.

A major barrier is its inherently variable fuel savings, which depend on operational and environmental factors such as routing and weather conditions. This is compounded by the lack of a standardised method to accurately quantify WAPS performance during real-world operations.

To address this, GCMD and EPS implemented the study and published their joint report titled Quantifying energy savings from wind-assisted propulsion systems (WAPS): A case study on the Pacific Sentinel.

The Pacific Sentinel sampled predominantly near-headwind conditions during this four-month testing period. Accordingly, the mean instantaneous power savings derived from valid on-off tests during this period was 7.2%, with a 95% confidence interval between 6.2% and 8.2%. If the vessel experienced more favourable wind conditions, the savings could be higher.

Instantaneous savings reached as high as 28.1% when the apparent wind angle was 47° and wind speed was 15.3 m/s. There were instances where near-headwind conditions resulted in negative power savings as low as -14.0%. Both are statistically rare events given the range of wind conditions experienced in this particular testing period, at three standard deviations from the mean of instantaneous power savings derived during this testing period.

Over four months of testing, they observed a range of power savings across different wind conditions:

Mean instantaneous power savings: 7.2% (95% confidence interval of 6.2–8.2%)

We also observed peak savings of up to 28.1% and negative savings of –14.0%, though both were statistically rare.

GCMD said the findings matter as the analysis captures the full distribution of observed power savings linked to wind conditions rather than relying on a single aggregated value.

“This provides a more realistic and confidence-based understanding of suction sail performance on the Pacific Sentinel,” it added.

GCMD added that the pilot shows how much, and under what conditions, WAPS deliver savings. As GCMD runs more pilots, larger datasets will enable modelling and fuel savings predictions across diverse operating conditions.

“With quantified and verifiable savings, a pay-as-you-save repayment mechanism becomes viable, linking repayments directly to measured performance,” it added.

“This underpins our recently launched Fund for Energy Efficiency Technologies (FEET) fund, which decouples retrofit financing from vessel mortgages by offering unsecured leases.”

Classification society DNV on Wednesday (3 December) said it has granted a Type Approval Design Certificate (TADC) to CSSC Shanghai Marine Energy Saving Technology Co., Ltd. (CMES-Tech) for its new 5m × 35m Tilting Type Wind Assisted Rotor System.

This is the first domestically developed rotor sail system in China to achieve this recognition under DNV’s WAPS rules (ST-0511).

With this certification, the classification society said the system is confirmed ready for installation on DNV classed commercial vessels and marks a major milestone for China’s green-shipping technology industry.

As shipping faces mounting pressure from fuel costs and emissions regulations, the demand for reliable and efficient wind-assisted propulsion systems is rising globally. Recent years have seen a growing number of WAPS solutions certified by DNV, including fixed or tiltable rotor, wingsail, and suction sail systems from providers around the world.

The CMES-Tech tiltable rotor system features a retractable and adjustable design, enabling the rotor to adapt to varying draft and clearance conditions, and retract during cargo operations to avoid interference with deck/hatch operations or port infrastructure. The system also integrates intelligent sensing and automatic control to adjust rotor operation based on real-time wind conditions, maximizing wind propulsion efficiency, while maintaining safety.

Dr. Huang Guofu, General Manager of CMES-Tech, said: “Receiving the DNV TADC is a landmark for China’s green-shipping industry and a strong validation of our design’s maturity, structural integrity and operational practicality. It demonstrates that our 5 m × 35 m tilting rotor design meets the highest classification and validates our commitment to driving maritime efficiency. We look forward to working with DNV as we continue to innovate and deliver solutions that can deliver economic and environmental value to shipowners worldwide.”

As part of the TADC process, DNV’s classification experts reviewed all mechanical, structural, and electrical design documentation, and assessed the system’s suitability for shipboard application under realistic operational and environmental conditions. The review confirmed that the design of the CMES-Tech system meets the requirements of DNV’s WAPS technical standard (ST-0511).

Mr. Chen Keng, DNV Vice President and Area Manager China South, said: “With increasing demand for energy-efficient and emission-reduction solutions, WAPS technologies offer immediate, tangible benefits to shipowners.

“The awarding of this TADC to CMES-Tech means we add another option to the growing portfolio of WAPS systems that have been assessed to the industry’s leading rule set, building further confidence in their readiness for real-world use. We congratulate CMES-Tech on this achievement, which underscores our strong collaboration on enabling the broader deployment new energy enhancing technologies.”

The rotor sail prototype has also successfully passed a rigorous 120% overload structural test, demonstrating its robustness under extreme load conditions. Looking ahead, CMES-Tech will proceed with detailed installation planning and sea-trials to validate the in-service performance of the new system.

U-Ming Marine Transport Corporation (U-Ming) and wind propulsion technology provider Anemoi Marine Technologies Ltd. (Anemoi) on Wednesday (1 October) announced the successful completion of the Rotor Sail installation on U-Ming’s Grand Pioneer, a 325,000 DWT Very Large Ore Carrier (VLOC).

U-Ming is the first Taiwanese shipowner to adopt Rotor Sails, marking a major milestone in the company’s decarbonisation strategy.

The four 35m tall, 5m diameter folding (tilting) Rotor Sails were delivered fully assembled and dynamically balanced from Anemoi’s production base on the Yangtze River and transported by barge to COSCO Zhoushan shipyard.

In a streamlined plug-and-play process unique to Anemoi, the sails were lifted directly onto the deck and secured in place. This method significantly reduces the shipyard’s scope of work and keeps installation time short.

For this installation, it took only 1.5 days to lift and fix the Rotor Sails in position onboard, with a further five days for commissioning and testing all four Rotor Sails and folding systems once the shipyard had completed their works during the vessel’s scheduled dry-dock in September 2025.

Anemoi’s specialist team were present throughout the process overseeing the installation and will sail on the vessel’s maiden voyage from Zhoushan to Singapore, with the Rotor Sails deployed and operational. This is to ensure crew training and operational handover will be completed smoothly, equipping U-Ming’s seafarers with the skills and confidence to operate the technology from day one.

Following completion of the installation, Grand Pioneer will resume deep-sea service between Brazil and China under a long-term charter with Brazilian mining company Vale. The vessel is projected to achieve annual marine fuel and emissions reductions of approximately 10–12% on average.

New insights from DNV’s Maritime Forecast to 2050, published on Thursday (11 September) showed that shipping’s energy transition is entering a new phase: One defined by strategic investment, accelerating fleet readiness, and emerging regulatory developments.

With the IMO’s Net-Zero Framework (NZF) approved but pending adoption in October, and the number of alternative-fuel-capable vessels in operation set to almost double by 2028, shipowners are shifting from preparation to action.

By 2030, the alternative-fuelled fleet will be able to burn up to 50 million tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe) of low-greenhouse gas (GHG) fuels annually, double the estimated volume needed to meet the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) 2030 emissions target. Yet today, actual consumption of low-GHG fuels remains at just 1 Mtoe.

This widening gap between capacity and use highlights both the scale of industry commitment and the urgent need for fuel producers and infrastructure developers to accelerate supply to match the fleet’s readiness.

“The stage is set for the next phase of the maritime energy transition,” said Knut Ørbeck-Nilssen, CEO of DNV Maritime.

“The IMO’s Net-Zero Framework has imperfections and greater clarity is urgently needed around how the collected money will be spent. It is already influencing investment decisions, operational choices and fuel strategies across the industry. Shipowners will adjust their strategic priorities pending the October IMO meeting, which will lay the foundation for the years and decades ahead.”

The ninth edition of DNV’s Maritime Forecast to 2050 provides a comprehensive analysis of the fuels, technologies, and regulations shaping the future of shipping, assisting decision-makers in navigating the next phase of the energy transition.

The report outlines several solutions that could help bridge the gap between fleet readiness and fuel availability:

Leveraging existing fuel infrastructure for low-GHG fuels, like biodiesel and bio-LNG, combined with the adoption of flexible chains of custody models can significantly ease access to these fuels, incentivizing and accelerating both production and uptake.

Energy-efficiency measures on newbuilds are increasingly deployed, reducing emissions immediately without requiring new infrastructure or supply-chain development.

Onboard carbon capture (OCC) is gaining traction, particularly for large vessels with available onboard space. Modelling from the report shows that equipping 20 major ports with CO2 offloading infrastructure could enable the removal of up to 75 million tonnes of captured CO2 annually, potentially offsetting the need for 25 Mtoe of low-GHG fuels, as much as is needed to reach the IMO’s 2030 base target

2025 could be a breakthrough year for maritime wind energy. Wind-assisted propulsion systems (WAPS) are gaining broader commercial adoption, with claims of 5-20% reduction in fuel use for certain ships, according to vessel owners, operators and technology makers.

“The industry has made real technical progress in recent years,” said Eirik Ovrum, Lead Author of the report.

“But these solutions are still operating in silos. To deliver impact, they need to be integrated into fleet strategies, supported by infrastructure, and recognized in compliance frameworks. That’s where the next phase of work must focus.”

This year’s Maritime Forecast to 2050 report urges stakeholders to prepare early and evaluate all cost-effective pathways, recognizing that compliance strategies will vary by vessel type, operational profile, and regulatory exposure.

Moller – Maersk (Maersk) on Friday (6 December) said it is continuing to explore options to diversify its low-emission fuel portfolio by testing ethanol in a dual-fuel methanol engine.

Building on a successful initial trial, the company will now blend 50% ethanol with 50% methanol in a test onboard the vessel Laura Maersk.

The first trial, conducted in October and November, involved a 10% ethanol / 90% e-methanol blend and confirmed that ethanol can be safely and effectively integrated into the fuel mix. The test underscores the potential to create greater optionality for Maersk’s dual-fuel methanol fleet, essentially enabling dual fuel alcohol vessels.

Laura Maersk, the world’s first dual-fuel container vessel operating on methanol, was designed for methanol as the alternative fuel. Because ethanol and methanol are both alcohols, they share similar properties. The initial trial tested whether an E10 blend would ignite and burn as efficiently as pure methanol while maintaining comparable lubricity and corrosiveness.

The results confirm that ethanol can be blended with methanol without compromising engine performance, paving the way for higher ethanol blends. Beyond the upcoming E50 test, Maersk plans to conduct a trial using 100% ethanol.

Emma Mazhari, Head of Energy Markets at Maersk, said: “Ethanol has a proven track record with an established market and existing infrastructure and offers an additional pathway for decarbonisation.

“By gradually increasing ethanol content, we gain valuable insights into engine performance and combustion impacts, informing fuel sourcing potential.”

Classification society DNV’s latest white paper recently highlighted that methanol-fuelled engines and technical systems have reached high readiness levels, and that existing global production sites, storage facilities, and a growing bunker fleet are providing a strong platform for wider adoption.

In addition, industry stakeholders are already investing in the fuel, with China accounting for 43 percent of planned global low-GHG methanol production capacity. But, as with all alternative fuels, methanol’s future role will depend on a combination of regulatory, economic, and operational factors.

Knut Ørbeck-Nilssen, CEO Maritime at DNV, said: “As the maritime industry explores pathways to a lower-carbon future, it is important to consider a range of practical and scalable solutions. There is no one-size-fits-all answer, and different shipping segments and geographies will require different approaches.

“Methanol is one option that draws on established technologies and infrastructure, and it is encouraging to see the industry’s growing interest in a variety of alternative fuels.”

Methanol can offer environmental benefits. It is sulfur-free, produces negligible soot, and emits significantly less NOx than fuel oil. The report highlights that certain bio- and e-methanol pathways can deliver very low or even negative lifecycle emissions, and that methanol’s compatibility with existing port infrastructure and the availability of interim bunkering solutions may also reduce complexity and cost for shipowners.

However, the report notes that cost and availability remain significant barriers, as is the case for many alternative fuels. Bio-methanol prices in 2025 average around USD 2,500 per tonne MGOe, roughly three times the cost of marine gas oil, while global production stands at just 2.2 million tonnes, far below the potential demand of up to 60 million tonnes by 2040. The report models four demand scenarios, showing that regulatory frameworks such as the IMO’s Net Zero Framework and FuelEU Maritime could be decisive in scaling up adoption.

Marius Leisner, Senior Principal Consultant in DNV, added: “From a technical perspective, methanol-fuelled engines have demonstrated high reliability, with industry data indicating that modern dual-fuel engine designs have accumulated more than 600,000 operating hours on methanol. Retrofit feasibility is well established, and the use of conventional bunkering systems, unlike cryogenic fuels, means ports can adapt quickly and cost-effectively.

DNV added methanol also provides fuel flexibility: dual-fuel engines can operate on methanol, biodiesel, or conventional fuels, and, with minor modifications, on ethanol.

A.P. Moller – Maersk (Maersk) on Friday (6 December) said it is continuing to explore options to diversify its low-emission fuel portfolio by testing ethanol in a dual-fuel methanol engine.

Building on a successful initial trial, the company will now blend 50% ethanol with 50% methanol in a test onboard the vessel Laura Maersk.

The first trial, conducted in October and November, involved a 10% ethanol / 90% e-methanol blend and confirmed that ethanol can be safely and effectively integrated into the fuel mix. The test underscores the potential to create greater optionality for Maersk’s dual-fuel methanol fleet, essentially enabling dual fuel alcohol vessels.

Laura Maersk, the world’s first dual-fuel container vessel operating on methanol, was designed for methanol as the alternative fuel. Because ethanol and methanol are both alcohols, they share similar properties. The initial trial tested whether an E10 blend would ignite and burn as efficiently as pure methanol while maintaining comparable lubricity and corrosiveness.

The results confirm that ethanol can be blended with methanol without compromising engine performance, paving the way for higher ethanol blends. Beyond the upcoming E50 test, Maersk plans to conduct a trial using 100% ethanol.

Emma Mazhari, Head of Energy Markets at Maersk, said: “Ethanol has a proven track record with an established market and existing infrastructure and offers an additional pathway for decarbonisation.

“By gradually increasing ethanol content, we gain valuable insights into engine performance and combustion impacts, informing fuel sourcing potential.”

Vietnamese shipowner Asia Pacific Shipping (ASP) on Tuesday (2 December) said it has taken delivery of Vietnam’s first methanol dual-fuel MR2 oil/chemical tanker, ASP Rainbow, at Guangzhou Shipyard International (GSI), a subsidiary of China State Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC).

The milestone was celebrated with the official delivery of 49,500-dwt ASP Rainbow and the joint naming ceremony for the tanker and its sister vessel, ASP Sunshine, on 20 November.

“The two vessels, named ASP Rainbow and ASP Sunshine, are not only the first in a series of new builds ordered by ASP but are also the first commercial vessels in Vietnam to utilise dual-fuel technology,” the company said.

“Putting these new tankers into operation, which are capable of running on both traditional fuel and methanol, enables ASP to become the pioneer in Vietnam to own a fleet capable of using clean fuel.

“This technology not only offers maximum operational flexibility but also makes the vessels significantly friendlier to the environment.”

ASP added the move holds important strategic significance, particularly in the context of increasingly tightening international maritime environmental regulations, which have a direct impact on the adoption of methanol as an alternative fuel.

“Investing in methanol dual-fuel technology helps ASP overcome future environmental challenges while maintaining a competitive advantage in global business operations,” ASP added.

This is the first delivery in the company’s plan to build a series of methanol-powered MR2 vessels that ASP signed with GSI in 2024.

The research, published in Environmental Science: Atmospheres, used aircraft and ground-based instruments to measure sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides emitted by ships in the North-East Atlantic and European coastal waters between 2019 and 2023.

The team found that the average sulphur content in ship fuel dropped nearly tenfold in open ocean areas following the International Maritime Organization’s 2020 regulation, which capped sulphur content in marine fuel at 0.5%.

Before the change, many ships exceeded the previous 3.5% limit. After 2020, only a small number of ships were found to breach the new standard.

In European sulphur Emission Control Areas (SECAs), such as the English Channel and the Port of Tyne, sulphur levels were even lower – well below the stricter 0.1% limit. Interestingly, ports outside these zones, like Valencia in Spain, also showed low sulphur levels, likely due to EU rules requiring cleaner fuel when ships are docked for extended periods.

This is the first study to use aircraft-based measurements and predictions from the Ship Traffic Emission Assessment Model (STEAM3) to assess ship emissions outside of sulphur control zones since the 2020 regulation came into effect. The findings support the widely held view that ships now emit around seven times less sulphur than before the rule change – an important step toward cleaner air and healthier coastal environments.

The Global Centre for Maritime Decarbonisation (GCMD) on Friday (5 December) said it implemented a Wind Assisted Propulsion Systems (WAPS) performance monitoring method with Singapore-based Eastern Pacific Shipping Pte Ltd (EPS) to measure suction sails’ performance on tanker Pacific Sentinel.

GCMD said WAPS are gaining traction as an important decarbonisation lever, but uptake is still far below what is needed to meet regulatory targets.

A major barrier is its inherently variable fuel savings, which depend on operational and environmental factors such as routing and weather conditions. This is compounded by the lack of a standardised method to accurately quantify WAPS performance during real-world operations.

To address this, GCMD and EPS implemented the study and published their joint report titled Quantifying energy savings from wind-assisted propulsion systems (WAPS): A case study on the Pacific Sentinel.

The Pacific Sentinel sampled predominantly near-headwind conditions during this four-month testing period. Accordingly, the mean instantaneous power savings derived from valid on-off tests during this period was 7.2%, with a 95% confidence interval between 6.2% and 8.2%. If the vessel experienced more favourable wind conditions, the savings could be higher.

Instantaneous savings reached as high as 28.1% when the apparent wind angle was 47° and wind speed was 15.3 m/s. There were instances where near-headwind conditions resulted in negative power savings as low as -14.0%. Both are statistically rare events given the range of wind conditions experienced in this particular testing period, at three standard deviations from the mean of instantaneous power savings derived during this testing period.

Over four months of testing, they observed a range of power savings across different wind conditions:

Mean instantaneous power savings: 7.2% (95% confidence interval of 6.2–8.2%)

We also observed peak savings of up to 28.1% and negative savings of –14.0%, though both were statistically rare.

GCMD said the findings matter as the analysis captures the full distribution of observed power savings linked to wind conditions rather than relying on a single aggregated value.

“This provides a more realistic and confidence-based understanding of suction sail performance on the Pacific Sentinel,” it added.

GCMD added that the pilot shows how much, and under what conditions, WAPS deliver savings. As GCMD runs more pilots, larger datasets will enable modelling and fuel savings predictions across diverse operating conditions.

“With quantified and verifiable savings, a pay-as-you-save repayment mechanism becomes viable, linking repayments directly to measured performance,” it added.

“This underpins our recently launched Fund for Energy Efficiency Technologies (FEET) fund, which decouples retrofit financing from vessel mortgages by offering unsecured leases.”

Mr Catani acknowledged constraints on the wider uptake of bioLNG and said GNV is working to make the use of bioLNG a structural solution for its operations, but current fuel availability remains limited and requires “significant investments, as well as the development of a supply chain capable of ensuring stable, large-scale provision”.

He added costs are still high, the quantity available on the market does not yet meet growing demand and it is “a complex journey that requires the commitment and collaboration of all stakeholders in the sector”.

The six-hour bunkering operation was conducted in line with current safety regulations and international guidelines, with 500 m3 of bioLNG transferred to GNV Virgo, which the companies said is enough to fuel the vessel’s return voyage to Palermo.

Van Oord has completed the transport and installation of all 21 monopiles at Iberdrola’s Windanker offshore wind farm, a key milestone in the construction of the project. This achievement involved the largest monopiles Van Oord has ever installed, made possible by earlier upgrades to its heavy lift installation vessel Svanen, which is now equipped to manage next-generation offshore wind monopile foundations.

Van Oord’s scope of work included loading the monopiles at the fabrication site in Spain and transporting them to the Port of Rønne, Denmark. Manufactured by a joint venture between Navantia and Windar, the monopiles rank among the largest ever installed by Van Oord, with a diameter of 10 metres, lengths of 70.6 to 86.6 metres, and weights of up to 2,145 tonnes. From the port, they were lifted using MTC cranes and towed by two tugs to the installation vessel Svanen.

Protecting marine life through noise mitigation

Van Oord used specialised techniques to protect marine life from harmful noise levels during monopile installation. Bubble screens created a curtain of air bubbles around the work area to absorb and reduce sound waves, while a Hydro Sound Damper net provided extra noise reduction.

Sustainable measures for offshore installation

In line with Van Oord’s ambition to achieve net-zero emissions, renewable fuel was used to power the compressors for the bubble screens, cutting greenhouse gas emissions for this activity by up to 86%. This sustainability initiative was made possible through a joint effort with Iberdrola, Van Oord and Hydrotechnik Offshore (HTO), who shared the costs of using renewable fuel.

Building on this effort, in partnership with Skyports Drone Services, long-range drone technology was deployed as part of an innovative pilot project. The goal was to transport items from the shore to the offshore installation site, reducing reliance on supply vessels and the project’s environmental footprint. Van Oord is now the first marine contractor to perform Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) drone flights to vessels in a wind farm under construction.

‘Completing the transport and installation of all monopiles at the Windanker offshore wind farm marks an important milestone for the project. This achievement reflects the dedication and expertise of our teams, the excellent collaboration with our client Iberdrola, and the outstanding performance of the Svanen. We are proud to have installed our largest and heaviest monopile to date, which demonstrates our commitment to enhancing the energy transition and delivering sustainable solutions for the future.’

Joost van Wiechen, Project Manager at Van Oord

Adding 315 MW to Iberdrola’s Baltic Hub

Located in the German Baltic Sea, around 45 kilometres northeast of the island of Rügen, Windanker will add 315 megawatts of capacity to Iberdrola’s Baltic Hub, supplying enough renewable energy to power approximately 315,000 households.

Upcoming phases: transition pieces and inter-array cables

Van Oord’s remaining scope will be delivered in two phases. The first involves transporting and installing 21 transition pieces, scheduled for completion by December 2025. This will be followed in the first quarter of 2026 by the installation of the inter-array cables, part of Van Oord’s EPCI scope, which involves interconnecting the turbines and offshore substation and supporting energy transmission throughout the wind farm.

""What we're seeing, and have seen for a few years, is that the regulatory landscape is changing on both mandatory and voluntary developments,"" Braathen said.

""There are lots of things happening at the EU level, national levels and also, of course, the IMO level concerning the shipping segment.

""There's no doubt that the green initiatives and the green regulatory changes are in super-focus in the industry at the moment, because of course this represents something new; it represents complexity, and it represents something most of the shipping companies are not really fully aware of or understand fully, and it's definitely not their core competence.

""Our role, and why we see it as a business opportunity, is precisely because of this uncertainty.

""It's where we can use our expertise and knowledge, and share that with our customers and stakeholders.""

GHG Services

The EUA market is Blue Energy's primary focus for shipping at present.

But the company is also preparing to offer biofuels, both B100 and blended products.

Compliance with the FuelEU Maritime regulation may also become part of its business in time, Braathen said.

""Of course, FuelEU Maritime is definitely something that we will investigate quite a bit in December to see what our role is in the market, where can we actually provide our expertise and guidance,"" she said.

""As a company, we will focus on being a supplier, so we would not necessarily go on the emission side into reporting, for example, or verification.""

The firm is also starting to see interest from shipping companies in UK Allowance procurement for compliance with the UK Emissions Trading Scheme. Domestic shipping will be added to the UK ETS next year, and international shipping from 2028.

EUA Procurement Strategy

The firm has seen a variety of approaches to EUA procurement for EU-ETS compliance in its work with shipping companies.

""What we're seeing at the moment is lots of different types of procurement strategies,"" Braathen said.

""The most common one is just to buy per voyage; I think at least for the mid-size and bigger fleets, that's definitely the norm.

""But for the smaller companies, it's quite interesting, they don't have the liquidity or the budget and so forth, and they are just bundling the volume and buying it as late as possible.""

A more complex approach may bear dividends, for those willing to become more deeply involved in these markets.

""There's room for improvement for these types of strategies, but it all depends on risk preference and risk exposure,"" Braathen said.

""It depends on, would you allow to only buy these allowances, or would you allow to also sell them.

""And if you buy them, bundling some volume ... and suddenly the market price dropped by 15%, in your governance and policy are you then stuck with that position, or are you allowing it to be sold back to the market and then buy it back at a lower price?

""And of course, it comes down to liquidity in the company.

""Do they actually have the liquidity to hedge for future years and so forth? It depends a bit on which type of company, but we definitely see discussions which are much more advanced than a year ago.""

EUA Savings

Braathen points to volatility in the EUA price this year as evidence of the potential savings to be made by altering strategy.

""Let's look at an example I gave to a customer about this a few days ago, where we just looked at prices during the autumn of this year,"" she said.

""Imagine if you were buying volume on, let's say, August 1, at EUR 71/mtCO2e.

""Let's say, to simplify it, you had a volume of 100,000 mtCO2e that you needed to buy, and then at 71 you buy all the volume because you believe that's a good price.

""Then you have another company waiting and waiting, and they decide to buy volume on November 1 instead, and they buy at EUR 82/mtCO2e.

""They have the same volume, but it's a substantial difference in this price just within those three months.""

The EUA price has averaged around EUR 73.41/mtCO2e so far this year, with a low of EUR 60/mtCO2e in April and a high of EUR 83/mtCO2e in November, according to Ship & Bunker data.

""I think a lot of companies don't necessarily understand the implications of this, because of course if you don't include that into your contract ... if you are a bit delaying the purchase or not having a proper strategy around it, then having these types of changes in prices could have a significant impact on the compliance cost and how it's spread out to your stakeholders and customers,"" Braathen said.

""You have what becomes a competitive advantage if you manage to time the purchase correctly, and what could be a significant disadvantage compared to your competitors if you buy at a terrible price level.""

IMO Delay

Another area Blue Energy might be interested in engaging with would be the IMO's Net-Zero Framework, which if adopted would include an element of buying and selling GHG compliance units to meet its thresholds.

The UN body's Marine Environment Protection Committee decided in October to put off a vote on the framework by a year.

Braathen questions whether consensus can be reached to pass the deal in its current format within that timeframe, but remains optimistic over the long-term prospects for global GHG regulation for shipping.

""At the moment, with all the lobbying from the US side, it is challenging to see how they will manage to change that sentiment within the year,"" she said.

""But the IMO have the opportunity now to maybe simplify it a bit and look at what they could actually control, It's not necessarily all about the financial aspects of this carbon framework.

""But of course, I am quite positive.

""I believe that at some point there will be a global carbon market for shipping; whether it's next year, or if it will take more time, let's see.

""What most of the member states want, of course, everyone wants; a fair, simplified system which makes sense.

""To get to that framework and find a compromise which everyone can live with, that's the challenging part, but from a regulatory perspective it makes so much sense to have a global system.""",https://shipandbunker.cdn.speedyrails.net/a/img/_mt_78b80c7c50864c9f516ee7b292bcaad1.jpg,N,,2025-12-07 20:56:45.661214

Imports of steel into the European Economic Area will face a carbon tax under the EU’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) starting on January 1. The decarbonisation-oriented levy will also apply to cement, electricity, fertilisers and other products.

Mills in India, the world’s second-largest crude steel producer after China, ship roughly two-thirds of their exports to Europe.

Experts say Indian mills will need to cut their carbon emissions.

“We recognise that we have to do environment-friendly production and companies are gearing up to comply, but they are also looking at alternative markets too,” Aruna Sharma, India’s former steel secretary, told Reuters.

Most of India’s steel is produced in blast furnaces, which generate higher emissions, said Sandeep Poundrik, the top civil servant at the Ministry of Steel, in September. He also said further expansion of blast furnace capacity is a concern.

Additional planned capacity could add about 680 million metric tons of carbon-dioxide-equivalent emissions from the sector, according to Global Energy Monitor, a U.S.-based research group.

Indian steelmakers have planned new investments to lift output as strong domestic demand – fuelled by government-backed infrastructure spending – continues to rise.

“Most of the companies are yet figuring out a way to deal with CBAM,” said Ravi Sodah, a cement, metals and mining analyst at Elara Capital. “In the near term, it is expected to slow down India’s exports to EU.”

One way to mitigate the problem is to use electric arc furnaces, which emit far less carbon than conventional blast furnaces.

Two executives at large Indian steelmakers, who asked not to be named because they are not authorised to speak to the media, said companies had little clarity on how the tax would be calculated.

“About 60% of our exports go to Europe and we want to know what is the rate that will be levied and will it be company specific?” said one of the executives.

The levy will raise the cost of Indian steel exports to the EU, especially blast furnace products, squeezing margins and EU market share unless producers cut emissions, said Lakshmanan R, head of South & Southeast Asia corporates at CreditSights in Singapore.",,N,,2025-12-07 17:56:10.847008

According to Gibson, “whilst both the CPS and STEPS scenarios are more pragmatic relative to the NZE, they still paint a diverging picture for global oil demand.
Under the CPS, demand rises steadily from 100 mbd in 2024 to 105.3 mbd by 2035, and to 112.8 mbd by 2050.

The overall trend is broadly similar in STEPS, although increases in refining runs in Asia and Africa are considerably smaller.","It seems that the tanker market will experience diverging paths amongst its various classes, but mainly between crude and product tanker in the years to come. In its latest weekly report, shipbroker Gibson said that “the 2025 edition of the IEA’s World Energy Outlook (WEO) arrived at a moment of mounting turbulence, driven by geopolitical tensions, major changes in energy policies and increasing debate how to address climate risks. Updated each year with the latest data and market trends, the WEO is not a forecast but an exploration of possible energy futures shaped by evolving policies, technologies, and market forces. In this year’s edition, three key pathways are detailed. The Current Policies Scenario (CPS), last published prior to Covid, is re-introduced in this year’s addition and assumes no new governmental policy actions beyond those already in place. It presents a cautious view of how quickly new energy technologies can be scaled up. The Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) takes the analysis one step further and incorporates all officially announced government plans, even though they have not yet been adopted. Barriers to adopting new technologies are lower than in the CPS. The Net Zero Emissions (NZE) Scenario is theoretical and lists the conditions required to achieve net-zero CO₂ by 2050”.

According to Gibson, “whilst both the CPS and STEPS scenarios are more pragmatic relative to the NZE, they still paint a diverging picture for global oil demand. Under the CPS, demand rises steadily from 100 mbd in 2024 to 105.3 mbd by 2035, and to 112.8 mbd by 2050. Growth is underpinned by increased use of oil in road transport in emerging market and developing economies, aviation, shipping and petrochemical demand. Here, the assumption is made that the share of EVs in total car sales plateaus after 2035 at around 40%. In contrast, STEPS shows oil demand flattening near 100.4 mbd by 2035 before easing to around 96.9 mbd in 2050, reflecting faster uptake of electric vehicles and higher efficiency standards. Still, even by 2050 demand remains at robust levels despite faster electrification and more aggressive government policies to reduce GHG emissions”.

Meanwhile, “supply growth is dominated by the Middle East, although the scale differs between the scenarios, with production up by 13.7 mbd by 2050 in CPS and by 6.9 mbd in STEPS. Latin America also sees strong growth, although on a much smaller scale. In North America, production rises through 2035 but declines thereafter, with a sharper downward trend in STEPS. Oil production in Europe and Asia Pacific declines sharply in both scenarios. In Asia, a region that accounts for much of global demand growth, supply falls by 2.6 mbd or 3.2 mbd by 2050 depending on the case. Meanwhile, Africa’s production falls significantly in STEPS, while remaining broadly steady-ish in CPS”, the shipbroker noted.

“Global refining runs also evolve differently. A much stronger demand base under CPS drives significant throughput increases in Asia in both the medium and long term, whilst smaller yet notable increases are also seen in the Middle East, Africa, and North America. European runs continue to decline due to structural weakness in regional demand and competitive disadvantages relative to refineries East of Suez and the US. The overall trend is broadly similar in STEPS, although increases in refining runs in Asia and Africa are considerably smaller. Still, the main difference involves the US runs, where throughput comes under downward pressure in line with a faster demand decline”, Gibson noted.

So, what will be the impact on tankers? According to the shipbroker, “the CPS provides a much more optimistic view for tanker demand than STEPS, but the reality is likely to sit somewhere in between. Much depends on the pace of technological development and future government policy choices. Still, even with different demand paths, several tanker trade trends are consistent across both scenarios. Rising crude production in Latin America, falling refining runs in Europe, declining oil output but rising refining runs in Asia – they all point to incremental long-haul crude trade. Both scenarios also show solid growth in Middle East crude exports”.",,N,,2025-12-07 17:56:17.205730

Saleem Khan, Chief Data & Analytics Officer, Pole Star Global explains.

The Paradox

The maritime industry faces a paradox: recently Yemen’s Houthi rebels signalled a cessation of Red Sea attacks following the recent Gaza ceasefire. Around the same time, Iran executed its first vessel seizure in months, seizing the Marshall Islands-flagged tanker Talara in the Strait of Hormuz on Friday, 14 November 2025. These two developments underscore a critical reality: regional maritime security remains fragmented, unpredictable, and expensive.

After 690 days of Houthi attacks that killed nine mariners and sank four vessels, the conditional ceasefire offers cautious optimism. Yet, Suez Canal traffic remains at historic lows, averaging just 36 vessels daily in 2025 compared to 74 in 2023. Insurance premiums tell the story though and insurers aren’t convinced. Red Sea war-risk rates remain elevated despite the announcement; as underwriters demand proof through multiple safe transits, before reducing coverage costs that currently add tens of thousands of dollars per voyage.

Iran’s seizure of the Talara, carrying 30,000 tons of petrochemicals through waters handling 20% of global oil trade, signals Tehran’s willingness to reassert control in the Strait of Hormuz. The incident prompted war-risk premiums in the Middle East Gulf to double within days, while hull and machinery insurance jumped 60%.

Impact on Safe Passage

These developments have an impact on safe passage and come with three key implications:

1. Bifurcated Geographic Risk: The Red Sea may experience gradual normalisation while Persian Gulf risks intensify, forcing carriers to reassess route optimisation strategies across two distinct zones simultaneously.

2. Insurance Market Volatility: War-risk premiums will remain fluid and regionally specific, with 24-hour quote validities and 96-hour cancellation clauses now standard practice, eliminating predictable cost structures for voyage planning.

3. Extended Cape Routing Persistence: Despite the Houthi pause, major carriers will maintain Cape of Good Hope diversions through at least Q2 2026, sustaining 10-14 day transit delays and suppressing Suez Canal revenues while creating potential freight rate collapse when capacity eventually returns.

Stakeholder Actions

Stakeholders across the supply chain can implement various measures to deal with these challenges. Fleet owners should consider implementing dynamic voyage insurance strategies with multiple underwriters, rather than single-carrier contracts. Exploring the use of real-time intelligence platforms for routing decisions that balance premium costs against time-charter economics is also advised.

In comparison, cargo insurers ought to adopt granular, passage-level risk assessment using vessel ownership transparency data and beneficial owner verification to differentiate premium pricing. They would also do well to consider fleet-based bundling arrangements for operators with strong compliance records.

Port authorities can act by enhancing berth scheduling flexibility to accommodate last-minute routing changes. It is also recommended to coordinate with maritime security agencies on threat intelligence, sharing protocols for vessels calling from high-risk transit zones.

Vessel crews can act by verifying that comprehensive war-risk coverage explicitly includes Red Sea and Persian Gulf waters before transit; and it is worthwhile maintaining heightened vigilance for GPS jamming and AIS interference, particularly near the Straits of Hormuz and Bab el-Mandeb chokepoints.",,N,,2025-12-07 17:56:34.916580
