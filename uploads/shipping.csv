The forest is not a distant frontier; it is a living center of the global climate system, the beating heart of hydrological cycles, and a guardian of the world’s carbon balance.","Adaptation indicators, including the implementation of nationally determined contributions (NDCs) and the Paris Agreement, as well as the NDCs submitted so far for the 2030 period, the Just Transition Work Programme, and the delivery of climate finance, among others, may be discussed during the negotiations.

Observers and negotiators who wished to remain anonymous warned that there are strong diplomatic headwinds that parties should be wary of. It is important to recollect that pressured by the United States, member countries of the International Maritime Organization (IMO), postponed a vote on a strategic plan to move the shipping industry away from the use of fossil fuel and become ‘net-zero’ by 2050.

The US warned of retaliatory restrictions and sanctions against countries that vote in favour of an International Maritime Organisation (IMO) proposal to cut greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from ships, observers said. “Similar fears are there, and there may be pressure on particular parties. That is why COP30 will be diplomatically a very challenging environment,” an observer said.

On Friday, the COP30 Presidency of Brazil sent out its ninth letter to Parties, which sums up what is likely to come up. The letter invites all Parties to help turn gaps into levers.

Drawing from the latest reports, including the Global Tipping Points Report, the letter acknowledges the scale of challenges ahead and the tools to respond as the global community gathers in Belém.

Following the completion of the Paris Rulebook at COP29, the latest edition will be the first COP where the full policy cycle of the Paris Agreement is in motion. Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), National Adaptation Plans (NAPs), Biennial Transparency Reports (BTRs), and the Enhanced Transparency Framework are now active instruments of global climate governance, the letter states.

While it may appear like the stakes are not as high as, say, last year when the New Collective Quantified Goal was on the table for negotiation, thepositions countries take may still send important signals, experts said.

HT reported on November 6 that the Brazilian COP30 and Azerbaijan COP29 Presidencies have released the much-awaited report on the ‘Baku To Belem Roadmap To USD 1.3T’, which documents how to deliver $1.3 trillion annually for developing countries from all international sources by 2035. But this document will not be negotiated on and remains outside the work of COP30.

“I urge all Parties to use our work under the negotiating agenda as a Mutirão (collective effort) for shifting the Paris policy cycle from design to delivery. COP30 can signal the maturation of the regime – from negotiation to coordinated implementation – anchored in equity, science, and cooperation,” André Corrêa do Lago, COP30 President, wrote in his latest letter.

China may assume a prominent role

Observers believe that China, the largest greenhouse gas emitter, is positioning itself to fill the void created by the US, especially because it also has economic interests in the green transition.

“Earlier this year, at a COP event in April 2025 - the Leaders’ Summit on Climate and Just Transitions, President Xi Jinping made a strong pitch for China to remain committed to global climate goals. Xi criticised ‘major countries’ for their unilateralism, iterating China’s support for international climate cooperation through multilateral governance platforms. Xi has called China a ‘doer’, one that has taken strong action for tangible results,” said Pooja Vijay Ramamurthi, fellow, Centre For Social and Economic Progress. “Second, Xi also called out the protectionist stances of powers of the free circulation of high-quality green products, and promotion of technological innovation and industrial transformation through cooperation. Therefore, given that these are the stances of China at previous climate events, it will certainly take up a leadership role,” she added.

China may call for the continuation of multilateral platforms, encouraging countries to engage in constructive climate negotiations. It will point out its own large-scale, rapid green transitions, positioning itself as a leader whose model can be followed. Rather than keeping a low profile, it is expected that China will portray itself a champion of green transitions, given that other major powers such as the US are backing down.

It will however, as usual, place itself into the Global South camp, calling for solidarity against ramping down coal too soon. This has been reflected in China’s NDCs, which some critics do not find as ambitious as some expected, Ramamurthi noted.

Adaptation likely to be critical for India

HT reported on November 4 that finalising adaptation indicators at the UN Climate Change Conference (COP30) in Belem will be an important issue for India, Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav said in a briefing. “Adaptation is an important issue at COP30. The adaptation indicators need to be rationalised. It will be a big issue. Indicators must be rationalised, based on national circumstances, finance, technology, capacity, etc,” Yadav said. India’s nationally determined contribution and national adaptation plan is also expected soon. It is likely to present its successful renewable energy transition at COP30. India has achieved one of its nationally determined contributions under the Paris Agreement, 5 years in advance. It has crossed its target of installing 50% of its power capacity from non-fossil sources. India is confident of achieving the target of 500 GW of installed electricity capacity from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030, Pralhad Joshi, minister of new and renewable energy has said.

“The time for promises is now over. COP30 must mark the shift from a bank of commitments to a true bank of actions, where delivery, not declarations, defines progress. Nowhere is this more urgent than in South Asia, a region on the front lines of the climate crisis, from the small island states like Sri Lanka to the mountains of Nepal, and the vulnerable states of India among others. For India, climate action is both a necessity and an opportunity driven by innovation and powered by partnerships. But to succeed, the world must come together through smarter, more inclusive multilateralism that rewards implementation and builds genuine coalitions of the doing,” said Arunabha Ghosh, CEO of the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) and special envoy for COP30 representing South Asia.

The COP when 1.5 degree C goal became obsolete

It will be important to look at how Parties respond to various scientific indicators at COP30. Temporary exceedance of the Paris Agreement’s lower limit or the 1.5 degree C goal is now certain, the United Nations Environment Programme’s Emissions Gap report, indicates. “New scenarios show that limiting warming to 1.5 degree C by 2100 remains technically possible. However, due to the continued delay in deep emission cuts, 1.5 degree C pathways now imply higher temporary exceedance of this temperature target. The magnitude and duration of this overshoot must be limited as much as possible. Each year of delayed action locks in carbon-intensive infrastructure. It results in greater losses for people and ecosystems, higher adaptation costs and a heavier reliance on costly and uncertain carbon dioxide (CO2) removal,” the report has said.

Further, The Global Tipping Points Report 2025, by the University of Exeter and international partners including the Stockholm Resilience Centre, found that widespread mortality of warm-water coral reefs is now underway as the world reaches its first climate tipping point. Forests are also an important issue. Brazil, the host of COP30 officially launched the Tropical Forest Forever Facility at the COP30 Leaders’ Summit on Thursday. The TFFF is an initiative that incentivizes the conservation and expansion of tropical forests by making annual payments to Tropical Forest Countries that maintain their standing forest. India will join the Tropical Forests Forever Facility (TFFF), Brazil’s global initiative to curb deforestation, as an “observer,” Dinesh Bhatia, ambassador of India to Brazil said in his statement on day 2 of the Belem Leaders’ Summit on Friday.

“The Amazon embodies the truth that awaits us in Belém: the future of humanity and the health of the planet are inseparable. The forest is not a distant frontier; it is a living center of the global climate system, the beating heart of hydrological cycles, and a guardian of the world’s carbon balance. If the Amazon crosses its tipping point, the planet will struggle to recover equilibrium, Lago has said.",https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/11/09/1600x900/logo/A-tourist-poses-for-a-picture-with-COP30-mascot-in_1762714132075.jpg,N,,2025-11-09 20:56:10.423145

“FuelEU Maritime has teeth and is already starting to bite bottom lines.
Even if these fuel and emissions savings are slightly less important for IMO compliance in the immediate term, commercially they cannot be overlooked.","“While we support the IMO in getting these vital regulations right, the vote to delay the Net-Zero Framework for a year will make progress more challenging. If global regulatory development breaks down further and the delay extends beyond 12-months, instead of one global framework, shipping could face a potential patchwork of regional emissions schemes with different compliance systems. Without the right support, this fragmentation would delay decision-making and keep current uncertainties around monitoring and reporting unresolved for the people working in shipping.

“The key here will be data management and integration. Whether it’s propulsion systems, voyage planning, onboard workflow, or design processes, the future of ship operations will favor solutions that connect data, technology and people seamlessly. Any regulation or technology that compounds the industry fragmentation will only add to the workload challenge, rather than help operators, seafarers and shoreside staff to support compliance and safe operations.

“The IMO’s decision does create more certainty that FuelEU Maritime and the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) will remain front and centre for longer. There will be renewed focus on FuelEU Maritime surplus (overcompliance) markets because companies that were waiting and monitoring how the regulations would fit with the IMO Net-Zero Framework will likely now commit.

“FuelEU Maritime has teeth and is already starting to bite bottom lines. Penalties are robustly enforced and, at €2,400 per ton VLSFO energy equivalent, they are high enough to encourage investment in alternative green fuels. With renewable fuel energy density, availability and cost in mind – this can, in turn, increase demand for efficiency technologies.

“Navigating the regulatory maze is imperative, but the reality is, many technologies already make commercial sense right now. Take wind propulsion, for example. Installations have doubled over the past two years, reflecting how operators now see this as a financially viable solution, regardless of the Net-Zero Framework, and not an experiment. Voyage optimization is another example. What was once a ‘nice to have’ is now a boardroom priority, because the savings on fuel and emissions directly impact competitiveness.

“Our joint simulation project between NAPA, Norsepower, and Sumitomo Heavy Industries Marine & Engineering, for example, has validated the emissions reduction potential of combining wind propulsion with voyage optimization. The study has confirmed that the combination can deliver up to 28% emissions reductions on average. Even if these fuel and emissions savings are slightly less important for IMO compliance in the immediate term, commercially they cannot be overlooked.",,N,,2025-11-09 18:16:30.454028

A jump of 13% came despite a downtick in EU-related seaborne trade, with disruption of trade through the Red Sea likely leading to longer routes. Last year’s record emissions levels show how important it is that emissions are priced by the EU, says T&E, which calls for an expansion to smaller vessels.

Container ships were the main drivers of increased emissions with a 46% increase. This is likely explained by an 18% increase in the average distance sailed and 3% average growth in operational speeds, as well as an increase in the number of ships needed to service longer routes. Shipping emissions are very sensitive to operational speeds as each 1% increase in speed can result in a 3% growth in emissions.

Agathe Peigney, maritime transport policy officer at T&E, said: “Last year’s record pollution shows that even when trade declines, disruption can lead to increased emissions from ships. With the inadequate IMO deal being shelved, the ETS carbon price has never been so crucial.”

The ETS for shipping has now been in place for almost two years and is proving effective, with around 99% compliance already in the first year. The upcoming review is a chance for the EU to stay the course on maritime climate regulation by strengthening and extending the system to ensure all polluters pay their fair share, says T&E.

MSC remains the most polluting shipping company in the EU, responsible for 15.6 million tonnes of CO2. Outside of the container lines, Grimaldi Group was the largest emitter (3.8 Mt), while Carnival had the highest emissions of any cruise company (2.5 Mt).

Despite Europe using ever more renewable energy, imports of fossil fuels remain stubbornly high. Fossil fuel carriers continue to make up around 20% of all EU shipping emissions, similar to 2018 levels.

The Energy Information Agency (EIA) has recently warned that new wells are needed in order to sustain (or increase) production levels”.
According to Gibson, “Trump’s administration has also taken several steps targeting vehicle emissions.
Meanwhile, “Trump’s environmental policy is also reaching beyond domestic borders.
The International Energy Agency (IEA) has come under increasing criticism, as Trump’s administration rejects the peak oil demand theory.","The tanker and oil markets are expected to face a different landscape, as a result of the latest policy choices by the US presidency. In its latest weekly report, shipbroker Gibson said that “Trump’s second presidency started with a strong push to change US environmental policy. Right at the start, the president put in motion the plan to re-exit the Paris Agreement and signed an executive order to “unleash American energy,” which established a framework to encourage domestic energy production and weaken the electric vehicle (EV) mandate. In the months that followed, federal lands and offshore areas previously off-limits to drilling were reopened for leasing, and several LNG export projects were reapproved. The Interior Department cleared new exploration in Alaska’s Arctic zones, while the Bureau of Land Management simplified environmental reviews for oil and gas projects in the western states. Still, several of these actions are facing ongoing legal challenges from environmental groups, and whilst headlines show US crude production reaching record levels this year, the bigger picture is that growth in output is slowing, with production expected to remain largely flat year-on-year in 2026. Companies remain cautious about spending on the back of lower oil prices and expectations of rising oversupply. The oil rig count declined in August to its lowest level in nearly four years, although a modest uptick has been seen since then. The Energy Information Agency (EIA) has recently warned that new wells are needed in order to sustain (or increase) production levels”.

According to Gibson, “Trump’s administration has also taken several steps targeting vehicle emissions. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is moving to roll back rules finalised in 2024 that require carmakers to sell more electric or low-emission cars from model year 2027 onward, with the process well underway. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has begun relaxing fuel efficiency targets. Separately, the “One Big Beautiful Bill” reduced or cancelled several clean-energy incentives introduced under Biden’s “Inflation Reduction Act.” In particular, tax credits for the purchase of new and used EVs are no longer available after September 30. While the reversal of these policies is being legally challenged on many fronts, the industry response is already visible. Several automakers have slowed their EV rollout plans. For example, General Motors, the largest US carmaker, recently acknowledged it is scaling back its EV ambitions by slowing production at EV plants and shifting investment toward hybrids and gasoline vehicles in response to the changing regulatory framework and weaker demand”.

“Changes to EV targets are expected to slow the decline in US oil demand. Ernst & Young now expects EVs to account for half of new US car sales by 2038, five years later than initially projected. The decline in US refining runs will also be shallower than previously envisaged, which will have implications for tanker trade. It will reduce US crude export potential, with more barrels retained domestically. At the same time, this will also add an element of support to US crude imports, mainly sourced from the Atlantic Basin. On the products side, stronger runs suggest additional CPP export potential; however, much will depend on underlying domestic demand levels”, the shipbroker said.

Meanwhile, “Trump’s environmental policy is also reaching beyond domestic borders. The International Energy Agency (IEA) has come under increasing criticism, as Trump’s administration rejects the peak oil demand theory. The agency is due to publish its long-term view of energy markets next week, where it will reintroduce the Current Policies Scenario (CPS), last published in 2019. This scenario reflects only policies already in place, without assuming new measures, announcements, or enhanced targets. The agency will continue publishing its Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS), which goes one step further and includes both implemented policies and officially announced plans or targets that are likely to be implemented”.

“In the maritime sector, strong US opposition to the IMO’s Net Zero Framework (NZF) was perhaps the key reason why the final vote on the agreed plan has been delayed by twelve months. In the weeks preceding the vote, the Trump administration warned that nations supporting the NZF could face retaliatory measures, including sanctions, visa restrictions, and commercial penalties. As a result, the industry is now facing an increased level of uncertainty – it is unlikely that the framework will be adopted in its current form next year”, Gibson noted.",,N,,2025-11-09 18:16:50.547860

09 November 2025 - 19:00

The US is pressuring countries to reject the IMO's proposed Net-Zero Framework for shipping emissions, warning of trade penalties, reported Washington's Politico.

The framework, endorsed by an IMO working group in April, requires final approval from a qualified majority of the 176 member states. US delegates walked out of talks earlier this year and sent a letter in August urging others to block the proposal.

The letter stated that President trump opposes any international environmental agreement that 'unduly or unfairly burdens' the US or its interests. The administration has threatened tariffs, visa restrictions and port levies for countries backing the IMO deal.

Industry groups are urging the EU to clarify its position. They want assurances that shippers won't face double regulation under both the IMO framework and the EU's Emissions Trading System and FuelEU Maritime Regulation.

European Shipowners formalised their request in a October letter to Transport Commissioner Apostolos Tzitzikostas. Climate Commissioner Wopke Hoekstra said the EU would review its rules if the IMO deal imposes significant costs, but industry says more clarity is needed.

Major shipping nations including Japan, Belgium, the Netherlands, Singapore, the UK, Norway and Denmark have signed a joint statement urging the EU to align with the IMO framework.

Some shipping groups remain sceptical. Last month, a coalition of oil tanker operators called for the IMO's approach to be reconsidered.

The IMO's Net-Zero Framework includes emissions reduction mandates and a pricing mechanism to penalise non-compliance and reward greener fuels. Global shipping accounts for about three per cent of greenhouse gas emissions.

Despite opposition from the US and some oil-producing countries, 63 IMO members expressed support for the framework in April. Alison Shaw of Transport & Environment said this shows strong momentum for cleaner shipping.

Overall gross tonnage (GT), an industry measure for vessel capacity, totalled 78 million from January through October, down from 113 million from the year-ago period, AXSMarine data showed.

Orders for all of 2024 surged to a 17-year high after ships were rerouted to avoid Houthi rebel attacks in the Red Sea, a process that required putting more ships in use to maintain schedules on the longer voyages.

Operators were also preparing for new environmental regulations from the United Nations' standard-setting authority for international shipping.

Orders for alternative fuel ships were roughly 29 million GT in the first 10 months of this year, down from 42 million GT in the year-earlier period, according to AXSMarine data.

But uncertainty spiked again last month when, under pressure from delegates from the United States and Saudi Arabia, member countries of the UN's International Maritime Organisation, voted to postpone for one year a controversial decision that would have helped to set unreasonable global carbon-reduction targets and to punish or reward adherence to those goals.

""With the IMO's Net-Zero Framework vote delayed, a 'wait-and-see' approach now seems the most likely outcome,"" said Alexander Hadzhigaev, AXSMarine's vice president of data, referring to future ordering.

Maritime shipping transports about 80 per cent of global trade.

More than 70 per cent of capacity ordered by container ship and vehicle carrier operators from January to October was alternative-fuel capable, compared with only 10-15 per cent for bulkers and tankers, Hadzhigaev said.

Liquefied natural gas remained the dominant alternative fuel, making up 29 per cent of total orders so far this year. Methanol stands at nine per cent, and ammonia and other fuels combined represent about one per cent, he said.

In the container sector, enthusiasm for methanol has cooled, with its share of new orders dropping from 48 per cent in 2023 and 18 per cent in 2024 to just 10 per cent in 2025, as fuel availability and cost remain key challenges, AXSMarine data showed.

Money, you say?

Bingo. But the projected annual US$15 billion bill facing container shipping lines and other carriers under the IMO’s Net Zero Framework (NZF) is only one line item in the decarbonization cost projections for maritime freight movement.

Cargo ships are seen lined up outside the Port of Los Angeles, Feb. 23, 2021, in Los Angeles, (AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill, File).

And money is only one shipping industry red flag.

As noted previously in the Substack Shipping News, the estimated annual cost to decarbonize maritime shipping ranges between US$8 billion and US$28 billion.

Make that US$90 billion if you factor in the investment in bunkering and the other energy transition infrastructure needed.

Overall, the bill for reaching the IMO’s 2050 zero-emission shipping destination is estimated at US$1.6 trillion.

But that is just a ballpark, big-picture number.

A small example of the impact on everyday operating costs was provided during an October 8 review of the main findings in DNV’s Energy Transition Outlook 2025.

Eirik Ovrum, the report’s lead author and the principal maritime environmental technology consultant for the maritime industry risk-management company, noted that the IMO’s NZF “will effectively double fuel costs by around 2036.”

That raises another NZF red flag issue: what lower-carbon fuel and what technology required to turn that fuel into efficient and financially viable propulsion power will be commercially available to shipping fleets embarked on ambitious decarbonization initiatives?

The answer today is not enough of either. That explains in part why the adoption of heavy marine oil (HMO) alternatives remains minimal.

According to DNV data, 2,851 ships out of a global fleet of 120,936 have dual-fuel technology. That is just over 2%. And only 8.9% of total gross tonnage today is powered by alternative fuels.

The HMO alternative for most of those dual-fuel ships (1,539) is liquefied natural gas (LNG).

The good news for NZF fans and decarbonization advocates is that 51% of new ship orders include dual-fuel technology.

Most of those are containerships.

But the IMO is not big on LNG.

DNV’s Maritime CEO Knut Ørbeck-Nilssen has taken the organization to task for erecting roadblocks that “make the pathway less attractive” for shipping to incorporate LNG in its decarbonization toolbox, even though approximately 600 ships sailing today have dual-fuel LNG engines, and another 700 on order will have that technology.

Lower carbon propulsion fuel availability is a major concern for ocean carriers.

Ørbeck-Nilssen has estimated that to hit its 2030 20% emissions reduction target, the maritime shipping sector will need between one-quarter and one-third of the projected global supply of low-GHG fuels.

More low-GHG propulsion fuel technology is being installed in containerships and other ocean-going vessels, but the percentage of dual-fuel ships in the world’s commercial fleet remains tiny | DNV

During DNV’s October 8 session, Ovrum speculated that ocean carriers could only source enough biodiesel to hit that 2030 goal if “road transportation stopped using biodiesel and gave it all to shipping.”

And that is just the fuel-use and availability side of the energy transition equation. Other challenges include the complexities and costs of refitting ships with dual-fuel technologies, allocating space aboard vessels for less energy-dense fuels, and incorporating costly and complex onboard carbon capture systems.

But another red flag raised following the U.S.A.’s NZF rejection in August is this: should a UN agency be entrusted with instituting and policing the initiative and collecting and disbursing the levies raised?

“There are disagreements in some areas. And you know, we have those member states that have agreed to the compromise approach … on the understanding that there is further work to do. We have … concerns that we need to take note of and then act upon. But it doesn’t mean that we’re divided.”

– Arsenio Dominguez, secretary-general, International Maritime Organization

IMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez thinks so.

At DNV’s September 16 launch of its Energy Transition Outlook 2025 report, Dominguez was confident that member states at the Extraordinary Session of the IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee in London would approve the initiative.

During his discussion with Ørbeck-Nilssen, he downplayed doubts about the approval.

Dominguez told the audience that “there is a consensus to move forward” with the framework.

“There are disagreements in some areas. And you know, we have member states that have agreed to the compromise approach … on the understanding that there is further work to do. We have … concerns that we need to take note of and then act upon. But it doesn’t mean that we’re divided. So, I’m still confident that we will continue to move forward [in] October.”

Dominguez got the month right, but not the year.

Countries opted to delay the NZF adoption vote to October 2026, which could push its implementation down the road to 2030.

In the meantime, America’s NZF opposition is another example of its distrust of the UN.

Maritime industry analysts and financiers also question whether the IMO is the right organization for the job.

John Lightbourn, a commercial shipping financier and the founder of U.S.-based Cavalier Shipping, suggested that the NZF implementation delay “could ultimately lead to a more resilient decarbonization framework — perhaps an acknowledgment that the IMO and, in turn, the UN, might not be the right body to oversee such a measure.”

He added that waning U.S. financial support for the UN raises questions about where funds collected under the NZF would end up and “whether financial pressures could arise to such a level that IMO will feel compelled to divert funds collected under the NZF to cover shortfalls in the UN’s operating budget.”

Shipping consultant Darren Shelton agreed that delaying NZF implementation might be better in the long run.

In a LinkedIn post, the Moran Shipping Agencies sales director wrote that “the postponement, while frustrating, may be the only responsible choice.”

He maintained that it would provide “a pause long enough to ask whether the IMO’s traditional structure can still manage a borderless industry shaped by private enterprise and accelerating technology.”

Shelton added that “progress in shipping has always depended on realism … Ports, fuels, and safety rules evolve through collaboration between practitioners, not speeches by politicians.”

Everllence 6G70ME-C10.5-GI main engine, designed for fuel efficiency and to minimise methane-slip.

SVESSEL Intelligent Smart Ship Solution, enabling real-time monitoring and data-driven optimisation of performance and safety.

SAVER Stator-D (Duct), SARB (Rudder Bulb) and SAVER-Fins to enhance hydrodynamic efficiency and reduce fuel consumption.

Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) systems and a hybrid vertical bow design that further improve propulsion efficiency and lower emissions.

LNG is one of several alternative fuel pathways AET is pursuing, alongside ammonia and other emerging low-carbon fuels, as part of its Energy Transition Strategy. When operating on LNG, by design dual-fuel vessels can emit between 14% to 23% less greenhouse gases (GHG) on a well-to-wake basis than those using conventional marine fuels, while significantly reducing particulate matter (PM), sulphur oxides (SOₓ) and nitrogen oxides (NOₓ)1.

Friday, November 7, 2025

I made the case last month in “Hey Ho, IMO Has Gotta Go!” that the Trump administration, not only rightly persuaded the IMO (International Maritime Organization) to delay a pseudo carbon tax on global shipping, but they should pull out of this climate scheme or scam all together.

Another specialized agency of the UN met not long ago as well, but unlike IMO, they managed to ‘fly under the radar,’ pun intended, of the federal cabinet and right leaning media. That was the triennial meeting of ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization) in September.

As the International Air Transport Association (IATA) put it: “As you can imagine, with a commitment to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050,…CORSIA—the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation—[was] in the spotlight…[at] this critical meeting[.]”

CORSIA “is the first global market-based scheme that applies to a sector,” boasts ICAO. And ICAO “adopted CORSIA in 2016 as the global carbon offsetting mechanism for aviation, rejecting carbon taxes and levies as effective solutions,” according to IATA.

“How does CORSIA work?” asks IATA. Their answer: “It requires airlines to purchase and cancel [Eligible Emissions Units (EEUs)] to offset their emissions over and above 85% of 2019 emissions.”

IATA goes on to note: “But there’s a big challenge: There aren’t enough EEUs on the market for airlines to purchase. … The resulting scarce supply of EEUs also distorts the market and drives up the price of the EEUs.”

However, according to Forbes in 2024: “There’s no current real-world data showing a direct correlation between the price of carbon credits for offsetting and airline ticket prices. … However,…as credits become more expensive or harder to find, the cost for airlines will rise.”

Also in 2024, IATA found that fuel costs were “28.7% of total airline costs” but these vary “significantly by region” such as “36.3%” “in Latin America and the Caribbean” “compared to 25.5% in North America.” And that capital costs of “depreciation and amortization make up 9.1%.”

In addition, a 2025 historical study of the pass-through by domestic aviation of fuel costs between 2000 to 2019, found that “the estimated results for 10% firm-specific fuel price increase are 2.4%, 2.9% and 1.3%,” for legacy, low-cost, and ultra-low-cost carriers respectively.

Regarding in maritime shipping, one projection for the price rise of fuel costs is 350%. And such costs have been estimated as representing “between 50–60 % of a ship’s operating cost.” Some media reports suggested that shipping prices could, thus, increase by more than 10%.

In contrast to the price hikes expected in international shipping, those in international aviation are forecasted to be quite miniscule by comparison. For example, some 2024 modeling estimated an increment “of less than USD $2 per ticket in Phase I and up to USD $5 in Phase II.”

Barack Obama once ‘said the quiet part out loud’ in 2008 regarding all these climate schemes: “Under my plan of a cap-and-trade system, electricity rates would necessarily skyrocket.” It is unclear whether that is also the aim for CORSIA, after it becomes mandatory from 2027.

CORSIA’s apparent inability to make airline fares skyrocket, so far or anytime soon, has fueled, pun intended, not only much criticism from climate lobbyists, but also increasing allegations of “greenwashing” as well as green or climate “fraud.”

Stay Grounded accused the aviation industry of being “a greenwashing best practice case” because “CORSIA covers only a tiny part of aviation emissions [and] is a way for the industry to cheaply buy themselves out of climate commitments…like eliminating…fuel tax exemptions[.]”

Transport & Environment (T&E) went even further: “Offsetting is a climate fraud, perpetuated on unsuspecting passengers by an industry resisting real climate action. CORSIA is a non-starter[.] [And] ICAO…will never rise to the challenge of aviation’s climate problem.”

Fraud is defined as “a misrepresentation of fact that was either intentional or negligent.” Elements include: “The speaker…intended…whom the statement was made would rely on it. The hearer must then have reasonably relied on the promise and [was] harmed because of that reliance.”

Such terms are not mere semantics, as Dutch airline KLM’s “environmental measures” were deemed by the District Court of Amsterdam in 2024 to be “greenwashing,” declared “misleading due to being too vague,” and ruled to “only marginally reduce the negative environmental aspects.”

As in the case of IMO’s net zero scheme, President Trump 47 has issued executive orders at odds with ICAO’s CORSIA, such as: Putting America First In International Environmental Agreements; Reducing Anti-competitive Regulatory Barriers; and Leading The World In Supersonic Flight.

T&E warns: “Did Europe really think they could pass [IMO’s] global climate deal, (wrongly) dubbed the first global carbon tax, without a huge fight? … If Europe is not willing to seriously face off with Trump, it can forget about global deals…CORSIA being the prime example.”

Comparing jet fuel PPI (producer price index) from 1975 to 2025, vis-à-vis climate alarmism, is instructive. The high, low and average prior to Al Gore’s post-2000 climate crusade were: 109 (1990); 37 (1999); and 62. Since then: high 435 (2022); low 105 (2016); and average 202.

Even though ICAO and CORSIA have appeared to have caused little-to-no direct price harm to international airlines and passengers so far, nor are predicted to, the Trump administration should embrace the “precautionary principle” so beloved by the climate “bootleggers and baptists.”

That means getting out of CORSIA, before the mandatory phase starts in 2027. That might also mean withdrawing from ICAO too, before they, as a UN agency like the IPCC, eventually try to follow IMO with a global carbon tax. This is because, paraphrasing Star Wars:

“We must move quickly. The [globalists] are relentless. If they are not all [defunded], it will be civil war without end. … We will catch them off balance. … Do not hesitate, show no mercy! Only then, will you be strong enough with the [right] side to save [America].”

The plan to step up financing for sustainable fuels in shipping and aviation by 2027 comes as the bloc is falling short of decarbonising heavy transport by 2050.

The European Commission announced a €2.9 billion plan to scale up investments in green fuels by 2027 to curb carbon dioxide emissions from aviation and maritime transport, which together account for roughly 26.4% of EU transport-sector emissions.

With the EU’s binding climate goal of achieving climate-neutrality by 2050, compared to 1990 levels, slashing emissions in aviation and maritime transport is both essential and challenging for the EU27.

Commercial planes and ships are the hardest transports to decarbonise, and to this day they are still powered mainly by fossil fuels, despite EU legislation meant to help the shipping and aviation sectors to become climate-neutral.

“The package is about strengthening Europe’s competitiveness while moving decisively towards a net-zero future. By investing in scaling up renewable and low-carbon fuels, we are making Europe’s transport system cleaner, more resilient and more affordable for citizens,” said Commissioner for Sustainable Transport and Tourism Apostolos Tzitzikostas.

The EU executive estimates that around 20 million tonnes of sustainable fuels, including biofuels and e-fuels, will be needed by 2035 to meet green fuel targets for aviation and maritime transport. Achieving this will require an estimated €100 billion in investment, the Commission stated.

The nearly €3 billion announced on Wednesday is expected to be disbursed from the EU’s multiannual budget, running until 2027, to be invested in renewable and low-carbon fuel technologies.

Under existing EU law, the maritime sector must reduce its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2% from 2025, compared to 2020 levels. By 2050, shipping is expected to reduce its GHG intensity by 80%.

The aviation sector is expected to have 20% of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) — feedstocks like used cooking oil, agricultural waste and captured carbon — supplied at EU airports from 2035. Five per cent needs to be e-SAF — a type of synthetic jet fuel made from carbon dioxide, water, and renewable electricity.

By 2050, green fuels for aviation must account for 70%, of which 35% must be eSAF.

However, available and estimated volumes of bio and e-SAF are far from meeting the post-2030 green fuel needs for aviation, according to the Commission.

“Mandates alone do not create a functioning SAF market, and it is high time we collectively admit that and take action to accelerate affordable SAF,” Ourania Georgoutsakou, managing director of the aviation lobby group Airlines for Europe (A4E), said in a statement.

“Ultimately, reducing SAF costs is essential to ensuring air travel remains accessible to all while reinforcing the competitiveness of European airlines,” A4E stated.

e-fuels and biofuels

More than 40 e-fuel production projects are at a planning stage in the EU, but none have yet reached a final investment decision, the Commission said.

Challenges in scaling up e-fuels are hampered by the availability, cost and maturity of renewable energy, eligible carbon storage and capture technologies and the energy intensity linked to generating green hydrogen.

Antony Froggatt, senior director for aviation, shipping and energy at the campaign group T&E, welcomed the Commission’s plan and the inclusion of e-fuels.

“For the first time, the EU will develop an effective financial instrument to kickstart production. The EU must now follow through on these commitments if it is to help preserve Europe’s technological leadership in e-fuels,” Froggatt said.

Concerns were raised about the use of biofuels, which Froggatt said would only “detract from” commitments to e-fuels.

“It is crucial that only e-fuels be eligible for the auctions as there are no market barriers for biofuels production”, T&E stated, in reference to the European Hydrogen Bank auction due by the end of the year with a €300 million window for aviation and maritime projects. This is part of the €2.9 billion unveiled by the Commission.

Jim Corbett, World Shipping Council’s (WSC) environmental director, said the Commission’s plan was a “promising first step” to accelerate the energy transition in shipping in Europe.",,N,,2025-11-07 17:56:14.544071

Cleaner fuel-burning ships accounted for 37% of cargo vessel orders in the first 10 months of 2025, unchanged from the year-ago period, as buyers were uncertain about when global rules for cutting maritime emissions will take effect, data from shipping consultancy AXSMarine showed.

Overall gross tonnage (GT), an industry measure for vessel capacity, totaled 78 million from January through October, down from 113 million from the year-ago period, AXSMarine data showed.

Orders for all of 2024 surged to a 17-year high after ships were rerouted to avoid Houthi rebel attacks in the Red Sea, a process that required putting more ships in use to maintain schedules on the longer voyages. Operators were also preparing for new environmental regulations from the United Nations' standard-setting authority for international shipping.

Orders for alternative fuel ships were roughly 29 million GT in the first 10 months of this year, down from 42 million GT in the year-earlier period, according to AXSMarine data.

But uncertainty spiked again last month when, under pressure from delegates from the United States and Saudi Arabia, member countries of the U.N.'s International Maritime Organization, voted to postpone for one year a decision that would have helped to set global carbon-reduction targets and to punish or reward adherence to those goals.

""With the IMO's Net-Zero Framework vote delayed, a 'wait-and-see' approach now seems the most likely outcome,"" said Alexander Hadzhigaev, AXSMarine's vice president of data, referring to future ordering.

Maritime shipping transports about 80% of global trade. The industry accounts for about 3% of climate-warming greenhouse gases, a percentage poised to climb without curbs.

Major container shipping lines like Maersk MAERSK_A and Hapag-Lloyd HLAG said they will move forward with efforts to cut carbon emissions from their ships.

More than 70% of capacity ordered by container ship and vehicle carrier operators from January to October was alternative-fuel capable, compared with only 10-15% for bulkers and tankers, Hadzhigaev said.

Liquefied natural gas remained the dominant alternative fuel, making up 29% of total orders so far this year. Methanol stands at 9%, and ammonia and other fuels combined represent about 1%, he said.

In the container sector, enthusiasm for methanol has cooled, with its share of new orders dropping from 48% in 2023 and 18% in 2024 to just 10% in 2025, as fuel availability and cost remain key challenges, AXSMarine data showed.",https://s.tradingview.com/static/images/illustrations/news-story.jpg,N,,2025-11-07 14:00:37.433912

IDB Debuts “Amazonia Bond” to Fund High-Impact ESG Initiatives

The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) has raised $100 million from its first Amazonia Bond. This funding will support important environmental and social projects throughout the Amazon region.

This first bond comes after the Amazonia Bond platform was launched in July 2025 by the IDB and the World Bank. The platform aims to attract private investment for sustainable development in the Amazon. The IDB hopes to raise up to $1 billion with more bonds in the future.

The program will use the funds for projects that fight deforestation, land damage, and illegal mining. It will also support good governance, climate resilience, and social inclusion. Projects must meet three main goals: reduce poverty, protect natural resources, and encourage inclusive, sustainable growth.

After this bond was issued, Brazil’s National Treasury showed interest in possibly issuing its own sovereign bonds under the Amazon Bonds Guidelines.

Corporations that are focused on meeting emissions targets can seek guidance from ESG tools.

Over 20 Airlines Agree to Revise Environmental Claims After Greenwashing Probe

The European Commission has made a deal with over 20 airlines, such as Air France, Lufthansa, and KLM, to change or remove misleading environmental claims. Some airlines had suggested that paying extra fees or using sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) could completely cancel out flight emissions.

This decision came after the European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) filed a complaint in 2023. The group said airlines misled passengers with false “green” marketing and called for refunds of deceptive environmental surcharges.

After the complaint, the EU Commission and Consumer Protection Cooperation (CPC) found several examples of greenwashing. These included using unclear terms like “sustainable” or “responsible” and making net-zero promises without proof. Airlines have now agreed to make sure all environmental statements are accurate, clear, and backed by evidence.

Companies committed to clean energy and corporate transparency should use ESG solutions.

Senate Republicans Oppose Resolution Aimed at Prohibiting Military Intervention in Venezuela

Senate Republicans voted 51 to 49 on Thursday to block a measure that would have stopped the Trump administration from taking military action in Venezuela without approval from Congress. Most Republicans opposed the measure, but Rand Paul and Lisa Murkowski joined Democrats in supporting it.

Senator Tim Kaine, a Democrat from Virginia and co-sponsor of the resolution, said it was meant to prevent a possible land invasion of Venezuela. He stressed that the resolution addressed more than just recent U.S. strikes on suspected drug boats in Latin America.

Those against the measure argued that the president has full authority as commander in chief. Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, described Venezuela under President Nicolás Maduro as an “existential threat” and defended the administration’s right to take military action.

The vote came after reports of at least 15 U.S. military strikes in the region since September, which have led to more than 60 deaths.

Numerous actions are being implemented at the global, regional and national level aimed at achieving that goal.

In 2021 IMO adopted the short-term GHG reduction measure, putting in place mandatory energy efficiency requirements requiring ships to progressively reduce their carbon intensity (EEXI and CII), thereby reducing fuel consumption per tonne/mile transported. Latest fuel consumption data reported to the IMO demonstrate an improvement of carbon intensity between 31 and 38% (depending on the metric used), compared to 2008, thus nearing the 40% target for 2030 as set out in the IMO GHG Strategy.

Further energy efficiency improvements can reduce fuel consumption and boost innovation in all ship segments. Rapid technological development in propeller design, air lubrication systems, wind propulsion, hull coating, and just-in-time operations lowered CAPEX and OPEX costs, and faster payback periods.

Ports continue to pursue partnerships along green maritime corridors, and currently over 60 of these corridors are at different stages of development, nourishing crucial first-mover experience in the use of alternative fuels, safe bunkering, shore-power, and forging demand for zero and near-zero emission fuels and technologies through cooperation in industrial clusters in ports areas.

IMO’s support to countries to develop National Action Plans further reinforces cooperation between the shipping, ports and energy sectors, as well as the financial sector to enhance access to finance for shipbuilding and retrofits.

Shipping plays an important role in the global energy transition, enabling the transport of low-emission fuels from their production locations to high-energy demand centers, also allowing ships to use those fuels for propulsion.

IMO is in the process of developing a next set of regulatory measures that will further chart the course of shipping’s energy transition towards net-zero, facilitating global trade, creating new opportunities for alternative fuel producing countries, supporting related maritime infrastructure development, and safeguarding reliable and affordable shipping for the many States depending on shipping as their lifeline to the world’s markets.

This event will focus on current action; and recommendations on how IMO and other stakeholders can further prompt the energy transition of shipping through

appropriate regulatory measures and broader enabling frameworks; including first-mover action and support mechanisms, notably for developing countries, in particular SIDS and LDCs, to ensure that no one is left behind.

Governments and other public entities, international organizations, industry and civil society representatives are invited to join this dialogue, and share their valuable insights on the necessary next steps in shipping’s energy transition.

The 42nd assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) closed in mid-October with no progress in addressing criticisms of ICAO’s Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (Corsia) despite producing a 26-page resolution.

It merely reaffirmed a global commitment to net zero carbon emissions by 2050 – ICAO’s ‘Long-Term Aspirational Goal’ – and endorsed Corsia as the single global market-based measure for crediting offsets.

But Corsia only applies to emissions above 85% of 2019 levels so will cover only about a quarter of international aviation emissions in Europe by 2035 and an analysis of credits issued by the middle of this year, involving a tree-planting programme in Guyana, found 84% did not represent real emission reductions.

Separately, a deal to reduce shipping’s global emissions was abandoned this month under pressure from the US and Saudi Arabia when representatives of more than 100 countries met to approve an International Maritime Organisation (IMO) Net-Zero Framework deal.

This would have seen shipping, including cruise, adopt global targets for emissions reduction.

Both setbacks came as the UK Climate Change Committee, which reports to the government on progress on emissions reduction, urged ministers to prepare for 2C warming by 2050, warning Britian is “not yet adapted” to current weather extremes “let alone” those to come.

Baroness Brown, chair of the adaptation committee, wrote to Department for Environment minister Emma Hardy whose responsibilities include net zero, climate change and adaptation, saying: “Adaptation is not keeping up with the increase in climate risk.”

She urged the government to prepare “at a minimum for the weather extremes if global warming levels reach 2°C above pre-industrial levels by 2050”.

In April, the committee declared current preparations “too slow, stalled or heading in the wrong direction”.

A report by UK sustainability consultancy Leafr published in late October suggested most companies in Europe won’t hit their sustainability targets.

Based on a survey of 450 sustainability leads across UK and EU businesses, the True State of Sustainability 2025 report found only 11% confident their organisation is on track – down from 24% a year ago.

Three out of four (76%) reported their team is inadequately resourced, two thirds (67%) said their team was the same or smaller than last year, 62% cited budget constraints as a barrier, and 42% flagged lack of engagement at the top of company, double the rate in 2024.

Leafr said the findings “reflect pressures inside the companies responsible for the majority of corporate emissions"". Two-thirds of respondents represented large or enterprise-sized firms with 250-plus employees.

Gus Bartholomew, co-founder of Leafr, said: “Sustainability teams can’t deliver net zero on their own. They are under-resourced, pulled in too many directions and forced into compliance work at the expense of impact.

Fellow co-founder Nick Valenzia said: “Boards would never accept financial accounts prepared by unqualified staff yet they entrust multi-million-pound sustainability strategies to under-resourced teams.""",https://dcxnozgahgy2a.cloudfront.net/AcuCustom/Sitename/DAM/377/shuterstock-shipping-emissions11_Thumb.webp,N,,2025-11-07 16:03:11.880819

However, researchers caution that scaling up biofuel production without strict safeguards could undermine climate progress, displace communities, degrade ecosystems, and worsen food insecurity.
While some nations may achieve marginal emissions reductions through advanced biofuels or waste-based pathways, the global trend in biofuels consumption remains deeply unsustainable.
92% of projected 2030 biofuel demand is still expected to be met by food-type feedstocks.
This is highly relevant for exploring sustainable fuel alternatives within international aviation and shipping decarbonization frameworks, such as CORSIA and IMO.","Scientists and civil society groups are warning COP delegations and attendees about the risks posed by a rapid expansion of global biofuel demand. While often promoted as a low-carbon alternative to fossil fuels, biofuels, particularly those made from food and feed crops, may carry serious environmental and social consequences if their production grows unchecked.

Current demand from the road transport sector is set to rise further due to ambitious targets in aviation and shipping, including EU and national Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) mandates and the International Maritime Organization’s Net-Zero framework.

However, researchers caution that scaling up biofuel production without strict safeguards could undermine climate progress, displace communities, degrade ecosystems, and worsen food insecurity. Projections indicate that by 2030, the global cropland required for biofuels in the transport sector, excluding crop co-products, could reach 52 million hectares, a 63% increase from 2023 levels, which is roughly the size of France.

Experts note that this represents a highly inefficient use of land and agricultural resources. By comparison, only 3% of the current biofuels area would be needed to generate the same amount of energy from solar panels, which underscores the relative inefficiency of producing energy by burning crops.

While some nations may achieve marginal emissions reductions through advanced biofuels or waste-based pathways, the global trend in biofuels consumption remains deeply unsustainable. 92% of projected 2030 biofuel demand is still expected to be met by food-type feedstocks. Meanwhile, even optimistic estimates of biofuel life-cycle savings are often dwarfed by the carbon opportunity costs of not restoring land to forests or other natural systems.

The expansion of crop biofuels is not a climate solution. It is a costly detour.

… the experts highlight.

As COP30 approaches—an opportune moment of global reckoning and responsibility, the signatories call on world leaders to:

Prevent an uninhibited expansion of first-generation biofuels under international climate mechanisms or national plans;

Phase out subsidies and mandates for biofuels from food and feed crops, and redirect support to more sustainable energy solutions;

Prioritise investments in electrification and energy efficiency and sufficiency as primary strategies for decarbonizing road transport;

Prioritise land restoration and biodiversity protection over land conversion for fuel production;

Establish robust global sustainability criteria, verification procedures, and sufficient enforcement frameworks that justifiably account for indirect emissions, carbon opportunity costs, and social impacts. This is highly relevant for exploring sustainable fuel alternatives within international aviation and shipping decarbonization frameworks, such as CORSIA and IMO.

Finally, the scientists note that truly sustainable biofuels can play a limited role in decarbonising a narrow set of hard-to-electrify sectors, such as aviation, but this must not justify a blind embrace of policies that repeat past mistakes of relentless crop biofuels expansion.

The science is clear: we cannot burn our way to net zero, especially not at the expense of forests, food, and future generations. We urge you to reflect on this science in the decisions made at COP30.

There, they committed to aligning their operations with the Paris Agreement.
Yet even in the financial world, which is currently dumping its own low climate targets, there is no shortage of warnings about the economic consequences of climate disasters.
As Pakistani climate expert Ali T. Sheikh has commented, the climate is the first victim of militarism.
This can contribute to give new life to climate protests where Fridays for Future was interrupted by the pandemic.","A UN Environment Programme (UNEP) report released in November 2025 warns that the world is on a path to warm by approximately 2.8C this century if current policies are followed.

At a time when the world’s capitalist governments are completely preoccupied with rivalry between the imperialist superpowers, the military arms race, the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, nationalism, trade wars, and a spectacularly authoritarian and anti-science development in the US, the climate issue is one of the first victims.

With Donald Trump in power, the US has done everything it can to give the climate threat the finger. Under the mantra of “drill, baby, drill,” Trump, who was supported in the presidential election by huge contributions from oil companies, has ensured that the US has left the Paris Agreement and, in his much-publicized speech to the UN General Assembly in September, declared the climate issue to be “a hoax.”

Despite the fact that 70 percent of the world’s emissions can be traced to 100 global corporations, Trump has not only opened up oil exploration in nature reserves and on the seabed. He has also abolished 31 environmental protection regulations at home and stopped the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from even reporting on emissions from the US’s largest sources of emissions. As Politico and other media outlets have reported, the Department of Energy has even been banned from using words such as “climate change,” “green,” “emissions,” “energy transition,” “sustainability,” “clean or dirty energy,” and “carbon/CO2 footprint.”

This, as EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has cheerfully stated, drives “a stake through the heart of the climate change religion.”

Trump’s trade war has also secured a series of agreements on increased exports of oil and natural gas from the US, not least to Europe. Under threat of sanctions from the US and opposition from Saudi Arabia, Russia, and other oil-producing countries, a UN-led attempt to reach an international agreement on reducing emissions from global shipping within the International Maritime Organization (IMO) was halted as recently as October. This would have meant the first global tax on carbon dioxide emissions. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio called this a “huge victory for the White House.”

After Trump’s frontal attack on everything related to climate policy, the banks and oil and gas companies that pretended to play along for a few years after the 2015 Paris Agreement have quickly and brutally returned to “business as usual.” Despite the International Energy Agency (IEA) stating that no new oil and gas fields can be opened if the Paris Agreement targets are to be met, there has been a significant increase in investment in fossil fuels, supported by the world’s banks. As a result, oil and gas production, led by Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Norway, will continue to increase in the coming years, while the US and Canada will mainly increase natural gas production and China and India will mainly increase coal production.

Russia, for its part, is trying to circumvent sanctions by increasing exports to China and India to finance its war in Ukraine.

When American banks, including Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, and the whole of Wall Street, saw which way the wind was blowing after Donald Trump’s election victory, they quickly jumped ship from the so-called Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA), which was launched at COP26 in Glasgow in 2021. There, they committed to aligning their operations with the Paris Agreement. Canadian, Asian, and European banks such as HSBC, UBS, and Barclays quickly followed suit, until the NZBA was quietly shut down last month.

In the UK, where oil company BP has dumped its supposedly green ambitions, Keir Starmer’s Labour government is also expected to approve two new oil fields in the North Sea, Rosebank and Jackdaw, despite a Scottish court declaring them illegal. In Norway, where 100 new licenses have been granted in recent years, investment in oil and gas will reach a new record in 2025.

Even the major Swedish banks Nordea, SEB, and the AP7 pension fund have continued to invest heavily in new Norwegian oil. According to a review by Fair Finance Guide and the Swedish Society for Nature Conservation, Nordea has also removed previous restrictions on lending to particularly climate-damaging activities such as oil sands, shale oil, and exploration in the northern Arctic.

Incidentally, the Swedish oil family Lundin is a major shareholder in the oil company AkerBP, which has just discovered a huge new oil field in the Yggdrasil area of the Norwegian North Sea – according to AkerBP’s CEO, one of the largest commercial discoveries in a decade.

Although everyone knows that this paves the way for future climate disasters, investments already made and capitalism’s competition-driven profit requirements are forcing capital owners to act until the very end according to the same motto that Citigroup CEO Chuck Prince is said to have uttered in the summer of 2007, just before the subprime mortgage market blew up the financial system: “As long as the music is playing, you have to get up and dance. We’re still dancing.” This is made possible by the lack of massive popular and political resistance.

Few of the world’s media outlets have even bothered to report on the UN Climate Summit 2025, held shortly after the General Assembly meeting where UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called on world governments to close the yawning gap to the Paris Agreement targets at COP30 in Brazil.

Shortly before the opening of COP30, only a third of the world’s states have yet managed to present their national contributions to updated targets that should have been submitted long ago. Of those that have done so and are included in the count, the US has withdrawn.

Among those that have not yet managed to do so are the EU, which for decades has paraded as the climate leader of the capitalist world, and India. If the new climate plans submitted so far are implemented, which is unlikely, global emissions could be reduced by 17% by 2035 compared to 2019, according to a brand-new UN report.

But to achieve the Paris Agreement’s goal of limiting warming to two degrees, a 60% reduction is needed. None of the UN chief’s five priority measures have made any progress that comes close to what is required.

Guterres’ call for a “supercharge” of the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy, in line with the COP28 statement in Dubai on a “transition away” from fossil fuels, has had almost no effect. Despite rapid development of solar, wind, and electric cars, primarily in China, which is simultaneously building many new coal-fired power plants, this is not enough to break the capitalist world’s dependence on fossil fuels. The picture is equally bleak when it comes to “drastically reducing methane emissions.”

Nor is the world anywhere near the goal of “halting deforestation by 2030,” the destruction of the largest carbon sinks in land-based ecosystems. In Europe, logging is on the rise.

There is little prospect of “climate justice” for developing countries, in the form of financial support for debt relief, contributions to the “loss and damage fund”, or climate adaptation, which will be a central issue for the world’s poor countries at COP30, since the US left the Paris Agreement and phased out USAID. Despite increasingly frequent and severe climate disasters, most recently manifested by Hurricane Melissa’s rampage in Jamaica, Cuba, and Haiti, aid is being cut sharply in the shadow of the arms race, even from European countries such as Germany, France, and Sweden.

“The truth is that we have failed to avoid an overshooting above 1.5C in the next few years. And that going above 1.5C has devastating consequences. Some of these devastating consequences are tipping points, be it in the Amazon, be it in Greenland, or western Antarctica or the coral reefs”, Guterres admits to the Guardian. To the Amazon-based news organization Sumaúma, he emphasizes the need for a decisive shift.

But despite the fact that, according to the European State of the Climate 2024, Europe is the fastest warming continent, with 413,000 people severely affected by storms and floods, 335 deaths and 42,000 people affected by fires, the EU is undergoing a right-wing-driven loosening of the union’s already hopelessly inadequate “Green Deal”. All to meet the demands of companies for deregulation, clearly backed by the US, and increased competitiveness.

Yet even in the financial world, which is currently dumping its own low climate targets, there is no shortage of warnings about the economic consequences of climate disasters.

“The world is rapidly approaching temperature levels where insurance companies will no longer be able to offer protection for many climate risks,” says Günther Thallinger, board member of Allianz SE, one of the world’s largest insurance companies. Without insurance, which is already being withdrawn in some places, many other financial services will become unprofitable, from mortgages to investments.

COP30 was supposed to be a particularly important stage in the annual negotiations under the UN Climate Convention, where new and enhanced national climate plans would be developed, a global framework for climate adaptation would be established, and a new fund to protect tropical forests (TFFF) would be created. But with the 1.5-degree target already shattered, the governments of poor countries in particular have shifted their focus to demands for financial support for adaptation and reconstruction after climate disasters.

But even on that point, they are likely to be disappointed. As Pakistani climate expert Ali T. Sheikh has commented, the climate is the first victim of militarism. “The axe will fall on climate finance,” he said. “It will turn the world upside down and undo 30 years of climate cooperation since the first COP.”

Where governments fail, however, the new alarm raised by scientists and the thousands of participants from climate movements and indigenous peoples, who for the first time in several years will make their way to the negotiations in the heart of the Amazon, may serve as a wake-up call after several years of closed summits in authoritarian states. This can contribute to give new life to climate protests where Fridays for Future was interrupted by the pandemic.

Clearly inspired by the Gaza flotilla, indigenous leaders from across Latin America have boarded a flotilla from the banks of the Napo River in Coca, Ecuador, bound for Belém, Brazil, with the goal of reaching the UN climate summit. According to Democracy Now, members of the so-called Yaku Mama Amazon flotilla are demanding an end to fossil fuels, protection of indigenous territories and ecosystems from oil, mining, and industrial agriculture, and a ban on fossil fuel extraction in the Amazon rainforest.

For them, it is enraging that Brazilian President Lula da Silva himself has given hypocrisy a new face by defending the permit for new oil exploration near the mouth of the Amazon River with the argument that it is necessary to finance the transition to green energy.

In the shadow of warmongering and right-wing radicalization, awareness will sooner or later grow of the need for an anti-capitalist mass movement that can unite young and old climate and peace activists, trade unions, indigenous peoples, and social movements.

More and more people will realize the need to challenge the power of banks, big business, billionaires, and warmongers over the economy in order to begin a democratically planned and fundamental transformation of both production and how we live in balance with nature. The socialist insight that we cannot control and democratically plan what we do not own together, will grow.",https://internationalsocialist.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/cropped-logo-square3-250x250-1-32x32.jpg,N,,2025-11-07 09:00:52.074577

Key trends include: Fossil fuel carriers: They continue to account for around 20% of EU shipping emissions.

In addition, disruptions in the Red Sea forced ships onto longer routes, highlighting the urgent need for stronger carbon pricing and targeted climate policies.

Record emissions, flat trade volumes

Although trade volumes have remained practically unchanged, emissions continue to rise. This indicates that ships are becoming more polluting independently of the cargo they carry. The question arises: why is the shipping sector emitting more without transporting more goods?

Container ships drive the increase

Container ships are responsible for the entire increase in EU shipping emissions, with their emissions rising by 46%. Several factors contribute to this spike:

Longer routes: Red Sea disruptions have forced container ships to reroute around the Cape of Good Hope.

Higher speeds: To maintain delivery schedules, vessels are sailing faster, which increases fuel consumption and emissions.

More ships in operation: Additional vessels are deployed to meet operational demands.

These pressures have resulted in higher emissions per container ship, emphasizing the need for policies that address operational behaviors, reward energy efficiency, and support the use of e-fuels. Only through such measures can fuel consumption be reduced without slowing down global trade.

The role of fossil fuel transport

Shipping emissions are also influenced by the type of cargo transported. A large share of Europe’s shipping emissions comes from crude oil, LNG, and other fossil fuels. Key trends include:

Fossil fuel carriers: They continue to account for around 20% of EU shipping emissions.

Crude oil: Emissions from transporting crude oil imports have returned to 2019 levels.

LNG: Shipments had been growing since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine but decreased slightly in 2024.

The Netherlands, home to the Port of Rotterdam, is Europe’s largest importer of fossil fuels by sea. As Europe accelerates its green transition, companies reliant on transporting fossil fuels could face stranded assets. Importing fossil fuels keeps European shipping emissions high, highlighting the urgency of decarbonizing the energy supply.

The record emissions in 2024 show that operational pressures and fossil fuel transport are driving up EU shipping emissions. While trade volumes remain flat, the sector’s carbon footprint continues to grow.

Addressing emissions requires policies that target operational practices, support cleaner fuels, and reduce reliance on fossil fuels, ensuring sustainable shipping without disrupting trade.",https://safety4sea.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/shutterstock_1417504217-e1762511721414.jpg,N,,2025-11-07 09:00:56.745035

The shipping sector, long reliant on heavy fuel oil, is at the crossroads of transformation as major maritime nations convene in London to debate regulations that could drive the industry away from fossil fuels. The central goal is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through new, potentially groundbreaking measures that introduce the first-ever global fee on emissions related to climate change from shipping activities.

The Stakes and Scope of Proposed Regulations

The discussions held at the International Maritime Organization (IMO) headquarters focus on an ambitious “Net-Zero Framework,” designed to progressively lower the allowable greenhouse gas emissions from cargo vessels worldwide. Currently, shipping accounts for roughly 3% of global emissions, a figure on the rise due to expanding trade and continued use of fossil-based fuels.

The framework involves a pricing scheme targeting emissions: ships emitting greenhouse gases above a set baseline must pay fees or buy emissions credits. Penalties can reach as steep as $100 per ton of carbon dioxide equivalent for those failing to meet strict requirements. Conversely, ships that produce less pollution than mandated can earn surplus credits and even performance rewards.

How the Pricing System Works

Emission Level Implication Financial Impact Above Direct Compliance Target Must purchase emissions credits or pay penalty $100 per ton of CO2 equivalent Meets Baseline Compliance but not Direct Target Subject to penalties Varies based on excess emissions Below Direct Compliance Target Eligible for surplus credits and rewards Potential financial incentives

Driving the Industry Towards Net-Zero

The IMO has set an ambitious goal for shipping to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by around 2050. To meet this challenge, the industry is encouraged to switch to zero or near-zero emission fuels such as green ammonia, green methanol, and other sustainable alternatives. Carbon capture technologies, advances in electricity use, enhanced wind propulsion, and improvements in energy efficiency are also on the table as complementary approaches to curb emissions.

Given the typical lifespan of large ships—about 25 years—the clock is ticking for investments in cleaner technologies and new vessels capable of meeting these stringent regulations. Starting in 2027, penalties for emissions from large ocean-going vessels over 5,000 gross tonnage, which contribute to 85% of international shipping’s emissions, will come into effect.

Challenges Around Alternative Fuels

Although biofuels currently appear as a cost-effective compliance option, their sustainability is debated due to the large agricultural demand, which could displace food crops and even cause deforestation. Environmental groups urge the IMO to prioritize scalable green alternatives rather than biofuels made from food crops.

Green ammonia and methanol hold promise for the later decades of this century, likely becoming competitively priced and key players in the green transition of maritime transport.

Global Consensus and Dissent

The April 2024 meeting saw a near-agreement on the regulatory framework, though some countries voiced reservations, highlighting the complexity of achieving global consensus. The United States, Saudi Arabia, and Russia have expressed concerns, particularly about the economic impacts and regulatory details.

Despite these hurdles, environmental advocates emphasize the momentum behind the move for decarbonization, warning that failure to adopt these regulations promptly would delay critical progress, prolonging excessive emissions and associated environmental harm.

Economic and Environmental Benefits of Early Action

Advancement of climate action: Legally binding measures set a precedent for global environmental responsibility.

Improved public health: Reduced air pollution from ships benefits coastal and port cities.

Marine conservation: Lower emissions help preserve ocean ecosystems affected by climate change.

Financial incentives: Revenue from emissions fees is earmarked for sustainable fuel research and support for developing nations transitioning their fleets.

Implications for Logistics and Cargo Transport

This shift in maritime regulations affects global supply chain logistics by pushing fleets toward greener technologies and diesel alternatives, impacting freight costs and schedules. While transitioning may increase operational expenses initially, it promises long-term savings and efficiency gains through fuel economy and adherence to international standards.

For cargo movers, freight forwarders, and logistics planners, embracing these new guidelines early can result in enhanced reliability and compliance while contributing to environmental stewardship.

A carbon market watch study suggests the International Maritime Organisation's NZF is ‘woefully inadequate to bring down the carbon footprint of the shipping sector’.

The carbon market watch research led by industrial economics professor Michele Cincera projects the NZF, had it been adopted, would have led to emissions cuts of only 8-10% compared with the 43% that would be necessary to bring the maritime sector in line with the Paris Agreement goal.

The IMO Net-Zero Framework, agreed upon this past April at MEPC 83, the Marine Environmental Protection Committee, represents the first legally binding global regulation to decarbonise international shipping, a sector responsible for emissions equivalent to those of major economies like Japan or Germany.

Yet, as this historic moment approaches, a critical question hangs in the balance: Will this framework deliver both the ambitious emissions reductions and the equitable transition that our planet and its most vulnerable communities desperately need?

The answer depends entirely on decisions to be made in the coming weeks and months.

Framework

The IMO Net-Zero Framework introduces an innovative two-tier system that sets increasingly stringent greenhouse gas intensity limits for ships while creating economic incentives through a carbon pricing mechanism.

Ships that fail to meet targets will incur penalties: US$100 per tonne for moderate non-compliance and a steep penalty of US$380 per tonne for those falling furthest behind.

These fees are expected to generate an estimated US$10-12 billion annually, flowing into a novel IMO Net-Zero Fund designed to support the transition.

On paper, this is groundbreaking. The framework will drive shipping toward zero-emission fuels, with modelling from University College London and UMass indicating that e-fuels (particularly green ammonia) will become the dominant solution by the mid-2040s.

Yet, here lies the framework’s central tension: while it will eventually drive the right technological outcomes, it may arrive too late for a smooth transition, risking that the world’s most vulnerable countries will bear disproportionate costs along the way.

The IMO’s own 2023 greenhouse gas strategy established two equally important objectives: reaching net-zero emissions by or around 2050 and achieving this through a “just and equitable transition”.

A United Nations Trade and Development analysis reveals that ship transport costs may increase by 80%, with broader maritime logistics costs (which would affect imports) potentially rising by 30%.

For Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and Least Developed Countries (LDCs), which already bear the brunt of climate impacts they did little to cause, these increases threaten food security, economic development and the basic quality of life.

The framework’s projected revenue of US$10-12 billion annually, while significant compared to other climate finance mechanisms, pales in comparison to the estimated trillion dollars of additional investment needed by 2050.

Every dollar must work extraordinarily hard to serve both decarbonisation and equity.

Beyond shipping

The IMO framework is more than a shipping policy.

It serves as a test case for global climate governance in sectors operating beyond national boundaries.

International shipping accounts for roughly 90% of global trade.

How we decarbonise it will shape economic development pathways for decades to come.

Moreover, shipping’s transition challenge mirrors that of other transport sectors but with unique complications.

A ship’s route is often unpredictable, following wherever cargo demands and therefore requiring fuel infrastructure in numerous global locations.

This creates a chicken-and-egg problem: ship owners will not invest in new fuel technologies without infrastructure, and infrastructure will not materialise without demand.

The solution requires parallel progress on supply and demand.

Countries with potential for renewable energy production (including many in Africa) could become major green fuel producers, but they face higher costs of capital and infrastructure deficits.

Strategic deployment of Net-Zero Fund resources could help build this infrastructure while creating economic opportunities in regions that have historically been excluded from the benefits of the energy transition.

What adoption must deliver

When IMO member states gather in October, they must adopt a framework that explicitly commits to resolving these tensions.

The adoption process should:

Affirm the dual mandate: clearly restate that just and equitable transition is coequal with emissions reduction, not subordinate to it.

Establish guardrails for guidelines: Provide clear direction that reward mechanisms must preserve adequate resources for supporting vulnerable countries, that distribution boundaries must be interpreted to address shipping’s full climate impact, and that credit trading must include safeguards against perpetuating inequity.

Commit to transparent, inclusive guideline development: The negotiations that begin immediately after adoption must meaningfully include the voices of SIDS, LDCs and civil society organisations representing vulnerable communities, not just industry and major maritime nations.

Set review mechanisms that maintain ambition: Ensure that the 2032 revision of targets for 2036-2040 incorporates both updated climate science and assessments of progress toward a just transition.

Reflection

The transition away from fossil fuels in shipping is inevitable. The only question is whether it will be orderly or chaotic, equitable or exploitative, a model for climate cooperation or another instance of the powerful protecting their interests while externalising costs onto the vulnerable.

The close of the extraordinary session of the MEPC demonstrated that the IMO has, sadly, become vulnerable to political capture.

The Net-Zero Framework, which had been approved by 64 countries in April with only 16 opposed, was deferred for one year despite having clear majority support.

The process was reportedly bent to the will of certain influential actors through threats and intimidation, rather than genuine consensus-building.

The IMO Net-Zero Framework has been described as a “momentous achievement” – and in many ways it is. But achievements are measured by outcomes, not intentions. Without clear regulatory signals, the industry will continue to procrastinate on investments in zero-emission technologies.

The deferral creates regulatory uncertainty that could delay the transition by years, making it even more challenging to meet the 2030 and 2040 targets.

“Ensuring an international level playing field is essential for the competitiveness of European shipping.","The Commission published this morning the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan putting forward an action plan for investments in clean fuels.

European Shipowners welcome the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan as a good first step that identifies many gaps and shortcomings in the existing European policy and finance framework.

STIP clearly recognises the need for more investments in clean fuels for shipping and identifies possible next steps and concrete action points. It prioritises the production of clean fuels in Europe as a matter of urgency for the transition to net zero and for reducing energy dependencies.

“We’ve got ambitious climate targets but not the clean fuels we need for the energy transition. STIP is putting investments in clean fuels at the centre of the competitiveness agenda. These investments are necessary for retaining industrial capacity, for enhancing competitiveness, for reducing energy dependencies and for getting to net zero” said Sotiris Raptis, Secretary General of European Shipowners | ECSA.

European Shipowners welcome STIP’s suggestion to use national ETS revenues to support the uptake of clean fuels for shipping. The EUR 9 billion generated from the contribution of shipping to the EU ETS should be used to bridge the immense price gap with clean fuels that are on average four times more expensive than conventional fuels.

STIP correctly points out that clear requirements are missing for European suppliers to make clean fuels available in the market for shipping. As a first step towards the introduction of a binding mandate on fuel suppliers, European Shipowners welcome the commitment to further incentivise the uptake of clean fuels to meet the targets of the Renewable Energy Directive and the FuelEU Maritime.

“STIP takes a major first step towards the use of the national ETS revenues to make clean fuels for shipping available at a competitive price. National ETS revenues have contributed substantially to the scale-up of renewables in Europe. We need to see the same happening for shipping. The use of the ETS revenues should also be matched by a binding mandate on European suppliers to make clean fuels available for shipping” Raptis added.

European Shipowners firmly support reducing administrative burden, especially for SMEs which are the backbone of European shipping. Therefore, European Shipowners welcome the commitment of the Commission to assess the burdensome reporting requirements for shipping companies and simplify rules.

However, the EU should go a step further and send a clear message on the full alignment of EU climate legislation with the IMO international measures, when adopted.

“Ensuring an international level playing field is essential for the competitiveness of European shipping. We expect a clear message from the Commission that the EU will fully align its policy framework with international measures when adopted at IMO level” Sotiris Raptis concluded.",https://cyprusshippingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ECSA-European-Shipowners-Logo-New.jpg,N,,2025-11-07 09:01:21.046667
