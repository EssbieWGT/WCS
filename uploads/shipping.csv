This public-private partnership advances innovation, sustainability, and competitiveness.

""This marks a turning point for GNV in cutting fleet emissions. LNG integration reduces pollutants sharply and builds expertise for Europe's maritime future, reinforcing our sustainable shipping pledge,"" said GNV CEO Matteo Catani.

The refuelling used bio-LNG from organic biogas, certified under RED II and ISCC via mass balance. This enables GNV VIRGO's Genoa–Palermo round trip with net-zero GHG emissions, proving low-impact operations are feasible today—aligning with EU decarbonisation goals for 2050.

""We aim to embed bio-LNG structurally, despite limited availability and high costs requiring supply-chain investment,"" Catani added.

The bunkering, per May 2025 Ministry guidelines, transferred 500 cubic metres of bio-LNG for the route's autonomy.

""We're proud to drive maritime innovation with GNV from Genoa, our Italian base. This launches Small Scale LNG projects ahead,"" said Axpo Italia CEO Simone Demarchi.

Matteo Paroli hailed the ""historic"" bio-LNG ship-to-ship bunkering as proof of collaborative progress: ""GNV VIRGO advances Genoa and Italy's sustainable maritime sector.""

US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer has been at the very heart of the US policy maelstrom that rocked global shipping in 2025.

USTR policies on port fees have forced widespread vessel deployments, and tariffs based on USTR investigations have caused global shifts in cargo flows. Some shipowners have profited; others have lost.

The shipping industry was forced into Herculean efforts on contingency planning, only to see the port fees paused for a year on November 10 as part of the US-China trade agreement.

Countless ships were rerouted, vessels were refinanced to remove Chinese sale-leaseback exposure, time and money was spent on rebuttals to USTR proposals, and it all ended up being a bargaining chip in a much bigger game.

02 / Li Chenggang, China International Trade Representative

China, for whom Li Chenggang is the International Trade Representative, responded to the US port fee plan with tit-for-tat fees for ships linked to the US, calling them “necessary acts of passive defence”.

Its measures largely mirrored those of the US, even down to the lack of clarity about how “ownership” and “vessel operator” were defined.

There was consternation over how China would calculate the 25% US ownership threshold — but fees on all US-listed fleets would be far-reaching.

Fearnley Securities estimated the extra costs per call at $6m for a very large crude carrier, $5m for a capesize and $20 per tonne for a liquefied petroleum gas cargo.

03 / Marco Rubio, US State Secretary

Donald Trump’s White House and the departments of State and Energy were absent from the April meeting that approved the International Maritime Organization’s landmark Net-Zero Framework.

They more than made up for it next time round. State secretary Marco Rubio, energy secretary Chris Wright and transportation secretary Sean Duffy came out swinging against the NZF, and the economic threat it presented to the US (or more likely the relatively cheap political win it represented against UN agencies with green ambitions for industry) over the next six months.

What followed was an overwhelming show of diplomatic force to kill the NZF, including bullying, threats and intimidation against delegates from countries much weaker than the US. Rubio contacted several nations personally to promise retaliation if countries voted Yes.

The US and Saudi Arabia eventually won a one-year delay, which many think is the end of the IMO work plan — and thus the end of the industry hope of global carbon pricing.

04 / Mohammad Ayoub, Saudi Arabia (UNFCCC delegate)

While the headline-grabbing threats by the US were seen as the major blocker of the NZF, Saudi Arabia has long been the leader of the IMO bloc most opposed to green regulations.

The US and Saudi call to adopt the NZF under the old system of “explicit acceptance” — to ensure it never enters into force, even if it passes — was a deft procedural attack, throwing the EU and other delegates off guard and threatening to undermine the functioning of the IMO itself.

Saudi Arabia’s UNFCCC delegate, Mohammad Ayoub, was brought for this year’s two MEPCs to do what he does best: oppose, oppose, oppose.

Saudi Arabia also submitted several detailed documents listing the various reasons for countries to reject the green scheme they had approved just six months earlier, citing studies to argue carbon taxes would raise food prices for poor countries.

05 / Arsenio Dominguez, International Maritime Organization

Keeping October’s extraordinary MEPC meeting (there’s no better word for it) from going off the rails was arguably the biggest challenge an IMO secretary-general has yet faced.

Arsenio Dominguez narrowly avoided presiding over a rejection of the NZF, or a total collapse of the talks. He told delegates not to celebrate the outcome, but to “come back fresh in one year ready to negotiate”.

Dominguez made it his trademark never to answer when journalists asked what would happen should the NZF not be adopted. His job could well depend on whether it goes through next year.

06 / Sveinung Oftedal, chair, IMO ISWG-GHG (Norway delegate)

Norway’s IMO delegate Sveinung Oftedal chairs the IMO’s intersessional working group on greenhouse gases, ISWG-GHG. It is that forum, not the main chamber, where the real horse trading on carbon pricing usually takes place (perhaps because it’s closed to journalists).

Oftedal has sought gradually to build consensus on a plan that worked. He was instrumental in forming what became the NZF, which passed by a majority vote in April. That majority included Brazil and China, which had been significant critics.

Pacific Islands pushing for a flat carbon levy complained that their plan was sidelined, while the EU27 reckoned that such a levy would never fly. Oftedal got a global carbon price closer than anyone else has — no small achievement.

07 / Maria Angelicoussis, Angelicoussis Group

Greek shipowners have made no secret of their scepticism of carbon pricing. But the intervention in September by a group of six big players, led by Maria Angelicoussis, was important.

The support of the group, which has made big investments in liquefied natural gas fuel, was enough to sway the governments of Greece and Cyprus to abstain from the vote to postpone the framework, breaking with the rest of the EU27.

Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis has since called for Europe to rethink its green agenda more broadly. Let’s see how that plays out now that the EU’s are the only significant emissions rules for shipping in place for the foreseeable future.

08 / General Mamadi Doumbouya, junta leader, Guinea

After nearly 30 years, the $23bn Simandou mine is set to take the tiny African nation of Guinea from nowhere to the world’s third-biggest iron ore exporter.

The biggest mining project on the planet has the potential to reshape the global iron ore trade, giving China the advantage and displacing the dominance of Australia’s Pilbara region, with big ramifications for dry bulk shipping.

General Mamadi Doumbouya, who seized power in Guinea in 2021, is arguably more responsible than any other person for making Simandou happen, forcing mining giant Rio Tinto and its Chinese partners to share the huge costs of developing a railway and port.

09 / Magda Kopczynska, Fotini Ioannidou and Apostolos Tzitzikostas, European Commission

The setback at the IMO makes the European Commission — represented in this list by Magda Kopczynska, Fotini Ioannidou and Apostolos Tzitzikostas — the most significant regulator of shipping’s environment impacts for the foreseeable future.

The ETS and FuelEU Maritime regulations continue to be implemented, and a small industry has sprung up in response on advising companies how to pool and trade compliance surplus to avoid having to pay for biofuels or penalties.

The commission has kept shtum on whether it plans to carry out its threat to extend the schemes to cover 100% of voyages to and from EU ports, from 50% today, if the IMO does not deliver.

But another IMO delay in 2026, or a failure of the NZF altogether, makes such a tax hike far more likely.

10 / Emanuele Grimaldi and Thomas Kazakos, International Chamber of Shipping

The shipowners’ association, the International Chamber of Shipping, continues to be the main voice of the industry in IMO debates. It will have its work cut out for it next year as the role of industry associations diminishes and great-power politics takes over the carbon price debate.

But the ICS — represented in this list by Emanuele Grimaldi and Thomas Kazakos — remains influential in lobbying governments on industry topics including safety and security, alternative fuels and seafarer well-being.

In the two centuries international shipping has transitioned from sail to steam, and from coal to oil propulsion. As a result of the need to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions from ships, the industry is now on the brink of a ‘Fourth Propulsion Revolution’, possibly using a combination of hydrogen/ammonia and batteries powered from renewable energy sources.

Hi, Diana Stinson, President and owner of Texas Global Services. First of all, thank you for reading my blog. Also, this is a wonderful article by the Chamber (International Chamber of Shipping). Although, the author is unknown, this article shows the shipping industry coming in strong to meet the ambitious CO2 emissions target set by the IMO. Decarbonizing shipping and using zero-carbon technologies seems so far off. 2030 is just five years away and there needs to be a 40% efficiency improvement? I don’t see it happening that fast but I see the solution happening that fast. Hydrogen, ammonia and electricity powered ships? Wind powered ships? These ideas are bold and I love to share them with you. Are they realistic you ask. This cannot be in production already, can it?

The Blue Marlin Inland Solar cargo ship is already in operation. It is a hybrid ship that uses solar power to bring their emissions down considerably. Also, can be powered on solar alone for limited time. So the short answer is yes. These ideas are bold and they are realistic. The 106,000 HP engine that runs container ships is a huge ask to replace. Using ideas that reduce these emissions is the least we can do. Are we doing more? Yes. Pyxis Ocean’s maiden voyage was in June of this year. She is a wind powered hybrid that has experienced over 1/3 reduction in emissions using rigid sails. Hydrogen cell using vessels are in production for inland cargo ships and a California Coastal Research Vessel. I do see even bigger ideas becoming realities. Norway has a Sea Zero that is amazing. Fully electric cruise ship with retractable sails to be used on coastal Norwegian routes.

I’m very happy with the things I’m seeing to reduce the amount of carbon from the shipping industry. My industry of 22 years. There is much to be done. How much is in production I am unsure. The solutions have come and they are being implemented. There’s many cargo ships in the world, 58,000 says Google. I see opportunities for new companies and existing companies. Humanity comes together when they are needed the most. We are seeing that now. I’m still proud to be moving freight and am looking to the future that is coming fast.",https://www.texasglobalservices.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/hydrogen-ship-Copy.jpg,N,,2025-12-06 12:56:08.685415

“While decarbonizing the global shipping industry remains a long-term challenge, China, an indispensable partner in this endeavor, is emerging as a driving force in this transformation,” he said.

“This is thanks to its strong industrial base, world-leading shipbuilding capacity and growing strength in renewable energy.”

As the world’s largest consumer and producer of renewable energy, China plays a pivotal role in the transition. Its position as a strategic hub for international shipping and a major investor in clean technologies has attracted multinational collaboration in recent years, he added.

Everllence, which is headquartered in Augsburg, Germany, has been expanding its investment in key technologies, including future fuel engines, hydrogen, carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS), and industrial heat pumps, to support the decarbonization and digital transformation of the global shipping industry, he said.

According to Kettschau, partnerships with Chinese companies have been focusing on developing low and zero carbon engine solutions powered by clean fuels like liquefied natural gas (LNG), liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), methanol and ammonia dual-fuel engines.

“These collaborations are advancing next-generation technologies while driving the integration of innovation, local manufacturing and sustainable growth,” he said.

The push for greener shipping is reshaping China’s energy landscape.

In August, the National Energy Administration formally recognized green liquid fuels, including green ammonia and green methanol, as renewable energy sources, sending a strong signal to the market while aligning with surging global demand.

The global green fuel market, according to market research firm Verified Market Reports, was valued at $70.2 billion in 2023 and is projected to reach $175.1 billion by 2030, with a compound annual growth rate of 12.66 percent.

The International Maritime Organization (IMO) predicts that by 2050, green methanol demand could hit 190 million metric tons, comprising 42 percent of the shipping fuel mix, while fossil fuels shrink to 15 percent.

Beyond the vessels themselves, Chinese utilities are also targeting the carbon footprint of the shipbuilding process.

State Grid Nantong Power Supply Co recently launched a pilot program to create “near-zero carbon “shipyards, implementing precise carbon management across the manufacturing cycle.

By replacing traditional ceramic heating with electromagnetic induction in the welding stage, the project improved heating efficiency by 50 percent and cut power consumption by 60 percent, it said during this year’s United Nations climate change conference, or COP30.

In the coating workshop, which accounts for the bulk of energy use, smart temperature controls reduced electricity usage by 30 percent, while further efficiency gains were realized in the assembly stage, where upgrading air compressors cut power use by 40 percent.

The company has also deployed an AI-driven digital energy management platform, allowing shipyards to schedule energy-intensive production during low-cost electricity periods, creating a commercially viable road map for green manufacturing in the heavy industry sector.

Everllence has just unveiled its new, dual-fuel ME-LGIA (liquid gas injection ammonia) engine. The development of this engine is not just a technical achievement. It is another concrete step to advance the green transition and toward a climate-neutral future, said Kettschau.

“With more than a century of history in China, strong local production capabilities in collaboration with our Chinese ship engine licensees, and a shared commitment to a sustainable future, Everllence will continue working hand-in-hand with Chinese partners,” he said.",,N,,2025-12-05 06:56:58.211930

At Marintec China, the world's largest maritime exhibition, companies from across the world are showcasing their latest green innovations. Wu Bin reports from Shanghai.

Marintec China has been held for over four decades, but this is the first year the exhibition features a dedicated section on decarbonization in the shipping sector.

GONG KANGKANG Head, International Organizing Committee for Marintec ""Our current IMO zero-carbon framework has now entered the final stage of implementation. We also needs a platform to bring together global resources to drive the application of decarbonization technologies—from research and development to commercial deployment.""

One key aspect of decarbonization is the use of clean energy.

Currently, the shipping industry mainly relies on LNG and methanol.

More companies are now developing equipment that runs on another fuel: ammonia, which offers higher energy output and zero carbon emissions.

This company is showcasing its latest ammonia engine, unveiled just last month and slated for delivery next year.

UWE LAUBER CEO, Everllence ""This year is a special year I would say because we see so much technology and so much change and that the shipping industry is pushing forward in terms of decarbonization, so ammonia, methanol, all these green fuels and engines and technology which is needed. You can found it here right away. Technology is ready, when the regulations are popping in, we are ready to go for it.""

This institute under CSSC, the world's largest shipbuilding group, is presenting a solution called the ""Green Energy Island"", an integrated unit designed to handle all these needs at sea.

LI XIN Deputy Dean, Shanghai Merchant Ship Design and Research Institute, CSSC ""The green fuel needed for future ships requires zero-carbon in both production and transportation. To meet this requirement, we have chosen to produce, store and resupply green fuel on a single offshore platform. This approach minimizes comprehensive costs, providing an effective green fuel solution for our entire maritime operations.""

Most of the new orders across the globe now come to China.

Despite some disagreements over the IMO's net-zero framework making shipowners more cautious, green innovations continue to advance.

With new rules coming and technology moving quickly, owners are being urged to invest in long term strategies built on data, flexibility and collaboration.

As shipowners prepare for another year of rapid change, Wärtsilä has outlined four trends it believes will shape how fleets are managed in 2026. The company says the sector is moving into a period where digital systems, mixed-fuel operations and long range planning are becoming standard expectations rather than future concepts.

A central shift is the move toward lifecycle optimisation. Instead of reacting to each new regulation or equipment requirement, owners are being pushed to plan for the entire life of a vessel. This includes environmental impact, fuel efficiency, operating costs and the ability to maintain value over decades. Wärtsilä argues that this approach only works when owners, operators and equipment manufacturers share data and maintain clear operational transparency.

Fuel strategies are also changing. Wärtsilä notes that no single pathway suits every company and that a vessel’s trading pattern, fuel availability and commercial priorities determine the right mix. Many owners are exploring fuel flexible engines, hybrid propulsion and systems designed to prevent methane slip. The company says these options help owners keep their fleets compliant as rules evolve.

Digitalisation and the use of big data remain a challenge for much of the sector, even as leading operators adopt real time analytics to guide daily decisions. Modern vessels often run hybrid power setups and advanced automation, making integrated data systems a requirement. Wärtsilä says the ability to turn operational data into recommendations is already cutting fuel use and emissions for early adopters. Issues related to data governance and system compatibility continue to hinder wider use.

Regulatory uncertainty adds another layer of pressure. The delay in the IMO’s Net Zero Framework has not slowed regional action. Measures like the EU Emission Trading System and FuelEU Maritime are pushing owners to strengthen compliance and reporting processes.

Roger Holm, President of Wärtsilä Marine, says collaboration across the sector is crucial. He states, “As we look ahead to 2026, collaboration will play a vital part in driving the sustainable transformation of shipping and shaping a cleaner and smarter future for the maritime industry.” He adds, “Legislation is critical to accelerating investment in alternative fuels, but it is no silver bullet. Decarbonisation is a team effort.”

For shipowners, the message is clear. Long term planning, flexible fuel strategies and stronger digital foundations will define competitiveness as the next wave of regulations and technologies arrives.",https://thedigitalship.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/favicon.ico,N,,2025-12-04 18:57:24.463352

A new white paper from DNV, Methanol fuel in shipping, highlights how the technology supporting methanol-powered vessels has matured significantly, with more than 450 ships either operating or on order and over 600,000 hours of methanol engine runtime logged to date.

Unlike ammonia or LNG, methanol can be handled using much of the existing port infrastructure, removing the need for new cryogenic systems and reducing both investment and operational complexity. Retrofit solutions are also well developed, offering flexibility for existing fleets.

One of methanol’s most significant selling points is its operational flexibility. Dual-fuel engines can run on methanol alongside other fuels, including biodiesel and, in some configurations, even ethanol. This optionality is a strategic advantage in a volatile regulatory and pricing environment.

Environmentally, methanol offers benefits such as sulfur-free combustion, reduced soot, and lower NOx emissions. In particular, bio- and e-methanol pathways hold potential for achieving ultra-low or even net-negative lifecycle emissions—if production can scale and sourcing remains sustainable.

Cost and Capacity Remain the Deciding Factors

Despite strong technical foundations, methanol faces economic and logistical challenges. Today’s bio-methanol costs hover around USD 2,500 per ton MGOe—roughly three times the price of marine gas oil. On the supply side, global production currently sits at around 2.2 million tons, a small fraction of what could be needed by 2040 if adoption accelerates.

The outlook is starting to shift, with a wave of new capacity investments underway. China currently leads with 43% of all planned low-emissions methanol production projects. But the speed of market development will ultimately be shaped by regulatory frameworks. DNV’s analysis points to the importance of international policy levers such as the IMO’s Net-Zero Framework and the EU’s FuelEU Maritime regulation in driving fuel transition timelines.

Tools like DNV’s Fuel Selector and Alternative Fuels Insight platform are already supporting shipowners in evaluating compliance options, assessing future investment risks, and modeling operational scenarios.

“Efficiency is even higher than for traditional diesel oil” “The figures for both laughing gas and ammonia slip are in the single digit ppms.
“We are where we want to be when it comes to ammonia slip,” he said.
“The engine alone is not enough” “First, we need to support the shipowner in the safe and reliable operation of the ammonia engines.","Over the last decade, Everllence has developed and commercially launched two-stroke, slow-speed dual-fuel engines capable of burning LNG, LPG, ethane, and methanol, offering shipowners the flexibility of selecting the right engine platform and low-carbon intensity fuel for their ship type and route to minimise CO2 and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The engine designer’s R&D efforts have been shaped by owner demands to meet IMO’s GHG emissions reduction ambitions and regional environmental regulations, such as FuelEU Maritime and EU ETS. In all, more than 1,900 alternative fuel-capable engines have been sold by the engine designer since the first ME-GI methane-burning prime mover was delivered more than a decade ago. That accumulated experience has underpinned the development of the ammonia dual-fuel engine.

“For the ammonia engine, we need to have a completely new level of maturity”

But Mr Foldager said in the case of ammonia, Everllence probably spent the most time on developing the B&W ME-LGIA, and it was “the most mature before we sent it to the market.” Mr Foldager said it was decided early on by Everllence – previously known as MAN Energy Solutions – that safety would be paramount in the engine’s development to mitigate any risk in the use of ammonia as a fuel, which is highly toxic.

“We have maintained that position,” he stated. “For the ammonia engine, we need to have a completely new level of maturity before we launch it to the market.” Mr Foldager said the company was under “an enormous amount of pressure” because other engine designers have launched their engines “at an earlier maturity stage, putting pressure on us.”

Despite the commercial pressures, the company stayed the course. It conducted full-scale engine tests at the Research Centre in Copenhagen in 2024 and full-scale testing on a commercial ammonia engine at Mitsui Tamano Works in Japan in 2025. After 150,000 hours of collective work, some 800 tests in Copenhagen and Japan and five years of R&D, Everllence unveiled the engine during a two-day event in mid-November that drew some 350 shipowners, operators, shipbuilders, ports, fuel providers and other maritime stakeholders from around the world.

In the quest to reduce shipping’s CO2 and GHG emissions, Mr Foldager said: “Ammonia is a wonderful fuel because there is no carbon,” adding, “because it is slow burning, it’s perfect for the two-stroke engine.” He said: “There are clear indications that the efficiency is even higher than [for] traditional diesel oil.”

When assessing it through the prism of decarbonisation, you can see why Mr Foldager describes ammonia as a “wonderful fuel.” Ammonia, NH3, is an excellent hydrogen carrier, it is carbon- and sulphur-free and when produced using renewable energy (so-called ‘green ammonia’) becomes a carbon-neutral fuel from a well-to-wake perspective. Additionally, it eliminates concerns around black carbon, methane slip and CO2 emissions.

“Ammonia is a wonderful fuel because there is no carbon”

Initially ME-LGIA engines, like other alternative fuel-capable Everllence B&W two-strokes, will have 5% specific pilot oil consumption.

But Mr Foldager was candid in assessing the risks of ammonia as a marine fuel. “It is toxic,” he said, noting concerns with leakage or ammonia slip in the engine. “It is toxic in handling, not only in the engine, but also in the systems: bunkering, the auxiliary system, the fuel gas supply system, the ventilation system, and emissions. We want to be sure that whatever ammonia comes out of the stack is of extremely low values.”

Mr Foldager emphasised that Everllence has had significant success in mitigating ammonia slip – unburned fuel escaping out of the stack – and nitrous oxide (N2O), which is a by-product of combusting ammonia. N2O, also known as laughing gas, is a powerful GHG gas with a GWP of 273, according to the US EPA.

Data shared during the Everllence event showed ammonia slip at less than 6 ppm across the entire load range. NOx emissions were well within compliance with both Tier II and Tier III regulations as ammonia combustion generates less than 50% of that of diesel combustion. Additionally, N2O, even at 100% load, was well below 2 ppm.

“Efficiency is even higher than for traditional diesel oil”

“The figures for both laughing gas and ammonia slip are in the single digit ppms. We are very proud of what we have achieved,” he said.

To minimise ammonia slip, Mr Foldager said Everllence spent an enormous amount of time on the actual injection process, researching spray patterns, pressure, and the design of the injector. He said the injection that Everllence is using is so-called ‘low sac volume’. Using a small amount of ammonia in the fuel injector nozzle affects the spray characteristics, allowing for the optimisation of atomising of the fuel and reducing unburned fuel.

“We are where we want to be when it comes to ammonia slip,” he said.

More work ahead

But Mr Foldager said that more work remains. “Where we need more work is in the actual system integration. The engine alone is not enough. You need all the other systems on the ship, the fuel gas supply system, the purging system, the ventilation system, etc. How those systems interact is an area where we really need to work very closely with the shipyards, ship designers and enginebuilders to make sure that we optimise the whole system,” he said.

Additionally, all ME-LGIA units will be equipped with a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) system. “If there is a small amount of unburned ammonia from the combustion, we use that in the SCR to further reduce the levels (of NOx slip). The SCR is now interactive with the engine. It is not a separate system now. The engine interacts directly with the control system and the SCR,” he observed. Mr Foldager explained that the interaction with the engine, control system and SCR comes into play when there is “not sufficient ammonia available in the slip.” At that point, he explained, urea could be added when operating in a Tier III area.”

Pilot projects and next steps

Next year will be a big one for Everllence and its ammonia engine, marked by type approval testing and initial service experience. According to Everllence, the first ME-LGIA engine will be delivered in Q1 2026, with bedding-in set for Q4, 2025. Mr Foldager said the company has about 20 pilot projects, many of which have not been made public.

Among those that have been made public are deliveries of Everllence B&W 6G60 ME-LGIA engines for two very-large ammonia carriers for Eastern Pacific Shipping, with factory approval testing (FAT) in Q1 2026 and delivery in Q3 2026.

A further four Everllence 7S60 ME-LGIA engines are destined for four Höegh Autoliner 10,800-CEU pure car and truck carriers. FAT is set for Q3 2026 and delivery in Q2 2027.

And another 7S60 will sit in a Newcastle bulk carrier in Japan, where the engine is currently on the Mitsui E&S testbed.

Mr Foldager said these engines were critical for gaining “the first real life experience in a ship” and “how the shipowner and crew interact with the engine.”

The digitally connected engine

Another important element will be collecting data from each of the engines in service.

“We have developed digitally connected engines. It’s real-life, high-resolution data. It means we receive 500 data points from the engine every minute, 24 hours/seven days a week, 365 days a year. The electronic engine itself produces about 2,000 signals continuously, and 500 of those signals are sufficient for us to know exactly what is happening in the engine,” he said. “It’s data that is generated in the engine from the control system with the sensors. So that means the data quality is impeccable,” said Mr Foldager. “We already have 1,000 engines that are connected this way,” Mr Foldager observed.

The data will enable Everllence to understand the overall health of the engine, troubleshoot any problems before they arise and ensure safety. “We insist that our ammonia engines are connected for two reasons,” explained Mr Foldager.

“The engine alone is not enough”

“First, we need to support the shipowner in the safe and reliable operation of the ammonia engines. We monitor this data 24/7 at our manned remote operation centre to support the owner and the crew.”

Remotely monitoring the data from the engine allows Everllence to make recommendations on optimising engine performance and increasing efficiency.

“In our standard performance report, we have a total of 13 different parameters that we monitor and score to see if the engine can be further optimised,” said Mr Foldager. He said, for example, data can show if the turbocharger is starting to foul. “As a result, we can recommend to the owner that it is probably a good idea to clean the turbocharger now.”

The owner can use the performance report to decide which actions they want to take.

“Second, it allows us to troubleshoot. If there is an issue with the engine, then we have all the data that we need. It enables our engineers to troubleshoot much faster than the traditional way, where we would send an email to the ship’s chief engineer asking them to extract the data and send it back by email. We must wait to receive the data the next day, before looking at it. With the connected engine, we have it instantly,” said Mr Foldager.

One key message that Mr Foldager wanted to share in wrapping up the interview was offered on a slide at the Everllence event. It said simply: ‘We are ready.’",https://dvzpv6x5302g1.cloudfront.net/AcuCustom/Sitename/DAM/184/Everllence_Ammonia_engine_fullwebzhgf1_Main.png,N,,2025-12-04 10:57:08.744129

But rather than running through the technology options and compliance pathways, he emphasizes that it will be flexibility which safeguards investment.
“Actually, energy efficiency will always be part of the most reliable transition strategy, because it offers ROI regardless of fuel type or regulatory scenarios.","As any with a passing interest in shipping’s decarbonization journey will be aware, the Marine Environment Protection Committee meeting held in October postponed the International Maritime Organization (IMO) decision to adopt a Net-Zero Framework (NZF) to price ship carbon emissions from 2028 onwards.

A range of narratives have been offered to explain the conflicting positions taken by administrations at IMO, with lack of agreement expected to re-emerge at future meetings. Some also view the pause in regulatory action as a welcome opportunity to further refine details relating to the Net-Zero Fund proposal and fuel standards.

But the lack of regulatory consensus represents a further development hindrance for an alternative marine fuels market which is already burdened by high production costs, supply chain limitations and the lack of fuel standards. While the 2023 IMO decarbonization strategy remains in place, the postponement has consequences for the fuel choices ship owners make for their newbuilds and retrofits for the months and years ahead.

“Regulatory uncertainty can discourage investments by shipowners, ports, energy providers, and bunkering operators,” observes Charlotte Nonnemann, VP, Regulatory & Public Affairs, Marine Systems, ABB’s Marine & Ports division. “With the adoption, acceptance, and enforcement of the NZF subject to at least a one-year delay, expectations for widespread alternative fuel use by 2030 are fading.”

Net-Zero Realism

One outcome of October´s proceedings appears to be a new realism among shipowners considering new investments, and a resolve to develop strategies that can accommodate a range of future decarbonization scenarios, says Nonnemann.

For the coming five years, she expects pragmatism to prevail in the face of regulatory uncertainty, as owners focus on efficiency gains that also secure decarbonization’s “low hanging fruit”.

Complicating matters is the fact that the EU’s Emissions Trading Scheme and FuelEU Maritime requirements are already in force. Owners and investors moving forward with newbuild or retrofit plans today will need assets which are adaptable to different decarbonization targets through a lifespan of 25 years or more, Nonnemann observes.

As industry watchers will know, the volatility that characterized the maritime markets through 2025 has by no means been bad for the freight and charter rates which drive the business of shipping. One irony of the loss of global regulatory impetus for green ship investments is that it coincides with a cash-rich moment for owners, with bankers also recovering their maritime appetites.

With opportunities better taken than missed, “plug and play” ship technologies which deliver cost- efficiency today and the flexibility to adapt to different decarbonization scenarios represent a sound investment, suggests Jostein Bogen, Global Product Line Manager Electric Solutions, ABB’s Marine & Ports division.

Future flexibility

“There is no doubt that regulatory uncertainty has impacted ROI decisions on green technologies, but demand for shipping services has not been diminished in the meantime: the need to optimize energy efficiency remains just as compelling,” Bogen says.

As a technology supplier dedicated to electric, automated and digital solutions, ABB’s long-term commitment to sustainability remains unchanged, but its systems are also wholly fuel-agnostic,” Bogen explains. “Cost efficiency is a permanent priority for customers, while our power and propulsion solutions support decarbonization independent of regulatory timelines.”

Fragmented regulations on ship emissions also make it more imperative to monitor, report, and analyze data to ensure voyage route efficiency matches charter terms, adds Bogen. “In the current situation, where regional and global regulators are out of step, owners need to be sure that their ships are and will be optimized for different outcomes.”

ABB’s power distribution and propulsion solutions can “plug and play” various energy sources, with generators running on multiple fuel types, battery power, fuel cells and even nuclear reactors, adds Bogen.

But rather than running through the technology options and compliance pathways, he emphasizes that it will be flexibility which safeguards investment.

“Actually, energy efficiency will always be part of the most reliable transition strategy, because it offers ROI regardless of fuel type or regulatory scenarios. Ship system flexibility is also constantly beneficial, but never more so than at the current time, where investors seek to hedge and future-proof vessels for new energy sources down the road.

”I don’t find it controversial to suggest that ships with an electric backbone offer that flexibility. Solutions which use electrification, automation and digitalization to optimize efficiency and are flexible to different fuel transition timelines are a practical way to handle current uncertainties.”

As the world pushes to cut greenhouse-gas emissions, seafarers face a major shift in their everyday work. The push for greener shipping doesn’t end with new fuels and engines. It will demand new skills, new training and new kinds of certification — if seafarers want to stay relevant and safe.

In the report Tides of Change: A Framework for Developing Just and Inclusive Green Shipping Corridors the authors warn, on page 8, that up to 800,000 of the roughly 1.8 million active seafarers worldwide will need additional training by the mid-2030s.

Already, many of the skills and certifications that once sufficed will no longer do. Ships that sail under so-called green corridors or that run on alternative, low-carbon fuels will need crews who understand the new risks and technologies. That means training for handling alternative fuels, fuel systems, bunkering procedures, fuel safety, emergency protocols and environmental standards.

Let me explain how the regulatory framework is shaping up — and what it likely means for you if you sail, or plan to do so.

Why seafarers must prepare — what’s coming

The momentum comes from the International Maritime Organization (IMO). Their proposed IMO Net-Zero Framework (NZF) aims to force big ships (over 5,000 gross tonnage) to lower their greenhouse-gas emissions. The idea: a global fuel standard requiring all ships to gradually switch to cleaner fuels or lower-carbon fuel blends, measured over the full “well-to-wake” lifecycle of the fuel.

Under NZF, ships would need to meet yearly fuel-intensity targets from 2028. Vessels that fail will pay penalties or buy “remedial units,” while low-emission ships can earn credits or contribute to a dedicated fund for clean-fuel adoption.

The push for cleaner shipping aligns with major global pressure. Governments, shippers, fuel suppliers, port operators: all will need to adjust. That means alternative fuels will become more common — biofuels, methanol, ammonia, hydrogen blends or other low-flashpoint fuels. Ships retrofitted or built for such fuels fall under existing safety rules.

That brings us to a code many seafarers already have to know: the International Code of Safety for Ships Using Gases or Other Low-Flashpoint Fuels (IGF Code).

The IGF Code originally covers use of gases — like LNG — or other fuels with a low flashpoint under a critical threshold. It specifies how fuel machinery must be arranged, installed and monitored to ensure safety. The Code entered into force in 2017 after adoption by IMO.

Already under IGF, seafarers working on such ships must follow special training and certification requirements. The training covers safe handling of fuel systems, emergency response, fire prevention, fuel containment, bunkering procedures and environmental protection.

With the shift to a broader range of low-carbon fuels (not just LNG), the need for training will expand. The IGF Code already allows for other low-flashpoint fuels — methanol, ammonia, hydrogen. Ship registries and classification societies have updated their rules accordingly.

Therefore, future seafarers will likely need: familiarization with the specific fuel used; advanced training for masters and engineers responsible for fuel systems; and updated safety and emergency-response certification.

In short: basic seafaring skills remain important — but they will join a growing set of new competencies focused on green fuels, safety and emissions compliance.

How IMO already pushes new training and what’s next

The report “Tides of Change” sees training and upskilling as a central piece of a just transition. It emphasises building local workforce capacities, knowledge transfers, and designing green-corridor projects with training embedded.

Meanwhile, on the regulatory side, the IGF Code remains the foundation for safe operations on ships using low-flashpoint fuels. Training under IGF already splits into at least two levels: basic familiarization for crew with general safety duties, and advanced training for officers with direct responsibility for fuels and fuel systems.

This means the maritime training institutions and maritime administrations will have to scale up — not only for LNG but also for a broader set of fuels as the green transition unfolds.

Starting 2024, the Code itself has seen amendments. The regulatory bodies keep updating technical requirements for fuel containment, fire safety, materials, and overall design and operation guidelines under IGF.

As green shipping corridors expand, and alternative fuels become more common, seafarers will likely need to prove competency in exactly the fuel type used onboard. That may include fuel-specific certification or endorsements, depending on the flag state and vessel type.

NZF postponed — but nothing stops momentum

It is important to note: during the last extraordinary session of the IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) in October 2025, member states agreed to postpone adoption of the Net-Zero Framework by one year.

That means formal global rules will not yet apply — at least until the vote reconvenes in 2026. Still, many industry stakeholders expect NZF to pass eventually. Pressure from regulators, ports, fuel producers and societies favour adoption.

Even without immediate legal force, the shift toward alternative fuels and low-carbon operations already moves forward. Shipowners who want to stay ahead, and charterers or cargo owners demanding lower emissions, likely will push for compliance with best-available standards. That means more ships will get retrofitted or built for low-flashpoint fuels. Crew training will follow.

Thus, seafarers who start thinking ahead — upskilling, seeking additional certification under IGF or fuel-specific modules — will gain a significant advantage.

What IGF means — and why it matters

The IGF Code fills a vital role in this transition. Under the code, any ship that uses gases or other low-flashpoint fuels for propulsion must meet safety standards. The code regulates everything from fuel storage and containment, to machinery, venting systems, fire safety, emergency procedures and crew training.

Beyond technical rules, IGF imposes operational requirements: crews must receive appropriate training depending on their duties. Masters, engineers, and others responsible for fuel use and fuel systems must complete “advanced training.” Other seafarers with safety or fuel-handling duties must at least get “basic familiarization.”

The code officially entered into force on 1 January 2017. Still, as new fuels (methanol, ammonia, hydrogen, bio-fuels) enter shipping, the code’s scope expands. Administration and classification societies continuously update guidance and regulations to cover these fuels.

Therefore IGF — and the associated training — stands already as maritime’s baseline for safe, low-emission propulsion. As the industry moves toward net zero, it will likely become even more central.

What this means for seafarers — take care about your future

If you sail, or plan to work at sea, now is the time to act. Relying on old certifications may not be enough in a few years. Alternative fuels and stricter emissions rules will demand new competencies.

Signing up for training under IGF Code requirements, or fuel-specific courses, will likely pay off. Masters and engineers would benefit most when they take advanced training focused on handling low-flashpoint fuels, bunkering procedures, fuel safety, emergency response and environmental compliance.

Vessel operators and shipping companies will need to plan human-resources development earlier. They must anticipate that many seafarers will need retraining or reskilling. Green-corridor projects should embed training and certification from the start, rather than treating them as an afterthought.

Even though adoption of the NZF is delayed, the broader trend remains clear. Ships will increasingly sail on alternative fuels. Regulations will tighten. The industry will demand new skills and certifications.

For you, this transition could mean better job security — provided you prepare now. It could also open new opportunities: operating green-fuel ships, becoming part of pioneering green-corridor crews, or even working with bunkering and alternative-fuel logistics.",https://seaemploy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ChatGPT-Image-Dec-4-2025-10_37_11-AM-e1764841075582.webp,N,,2025-12-04 14:56:50.536053
