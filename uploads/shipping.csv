​Following are the closing remarks by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, at the Hong Kong Global Maritime Trade Summit today (November 17):

Mr Grimaldi (Chairman of the International Chamber of Shipping (ICS), Mr Emanuele Grimaldi), your excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, all the distinguished guests that have come to this summit today,

Good afternoon. As we bring this impactful Summit to a close, may I express my gladness seeing that our discussions in the past two days have powerfully demonstrated how our global maritime community is navigating shared challenges - from trade realignment and supply chain resilience to financing our industry’s future. These dialogues have been frank and collaborative, as to be seen from our closed-door session yesterday as well as today's sessions, reflecting our common goal and the spirit of partnership we all value. During the summit, we have heard a number of buzzwords: fragmentation, deglobalisation, protectionism, unpredictability, collaboration, partnership and most important of all - solutions.

Scene setting

In an era of volatility, isolation or unilateralism is certainly not the solution. It must be forged through partnership. The government's role is not to direct, but to enable - to build the fundamental and foundational backbone that allows the private sector to innovate, invest and thrive. This philosophy underpins our recent establishment in Hong Kong of the Hong Kong Maritime and Port Development Board (HKMPDB) under the able leadership of the Honourable Dr Moses Cheng (Chairman of the HKMPDB, Dr Moses Cheng Mo-chi), ensuring government and industry work as co-pilots in shaping our maritime future.

Guided by this principle and bolstered by our nation's strong support, Hong Kong adopts a clear dual strategy: reinforcing the resilience of our local maritime ecosystem, while expanding opportunities in the Chinese Mainland and in the rest of the world.

First, we are enhancing both our port competitiveness and world-class maritime services. Our port's efficiency remains a key advantage, with vessel-handling speeds nearly double the global average - earning us the ""catch-up port"" reputation. We are capitalising on this by establishing a comprehensive ""rail-sea-land-river"" intermodal system to extend our cargo hinterland into inland provinces of the Chinese Mainland. Meanwhile, we are not only driving digital and green transformation through launching a new Port Community System for real-time cargo tracking amongst all stakeholders, we are also working, with the port operators, toward reducing our Kwai Tsing Container Terminals' carbon emissions by 30 per cent by 2030.

Complementing our port assets, we have an unparalleled cluster of over 1 200 shipping and maritime service companies, including the world's top ship managers, major protection and indemnity clubs and leading financers, as supported by one of the world’s largest fleets by gross tonnage flying the Hong Kong flag. To future-proof this leadership, we are streamlining our shipping registry procedures, enhancing tax incentives for the ship lessors and shipping commercial principals as well as introducing tax concessions for commodity traders, with legislative amendments coming right next year. Further, we will strengthen collaboration with international marine insurance organisations to upscale the training of marine insurance talents, whilst expanding the scope of the Maritime and Aviation Training Fund to cover more green energy courses, thereby reinforcing Hong Kong maritime strengths.

Secondly, we are proactively forging international partnerships to unlock new growth potential and solidify our role as a global ""super connector"". To counter protectionism, we are building partner port relationships with strategic ports in the Chinese Mainland and key Belt and Road regions for enhancing mutual competitiveness and resilience. Do expect our announcement of the first batch of our partner ports shortly later today. At the same time, central to this strategy is the Hong Kong Maritime Week itself, including the ICS World Trade Summit - our cornerstone platform for deepening international exchanges and collaboration. Every November, this gathering transforms our city into a vital nexus where global industry leaders converge to shape and drive positive changes for the future of the maritime trade. I am excited to share with you that we will be welcoming the Silk Road Maritime Association's summit one year from now during Hong Kong Maritime Week 2026, so stay tuned. This event and the week-long event will foster a strategic dialogue to unlock new opportunities in Belt and Road shipping for Hong Kong and the global community.

Despite the postponement in the IMO(International Maritime Organization)'s schedule, which we touched upon a lot during these two days, we, in Hong Kong remain steadfast in advancing our pace to strengthen and solidify Hong Kong's role as an international green maritime fuel bunkering and trading hub. Our prime location at the southern tip of China places us at the crossroads of international fairways, ideal for serving the global shipping community's bunkering needs. We rank seventh globally in shipping fuel bunkering, second in China and first in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. Since the first LNG (liquefied natural gas) bunkering operation in February this year, over 200 000 metric tonnes of biodiesel and LNG have been bunkered in Hong Kong, involving a total of 13 LNG bunkering operations. Having established biodiesel and LNG bunkering, we are pioneering the next-generation fuels - including methanol, ammonia, and hydrogen. We will commence feasibility studies for ammonia and hydrogen bunkering and mandate mass flow meters for methanol operations by next year. Further, leveraging our nation's green fuel supply advantages and Hong Kong's robust financial infrastructure, we are developing a global green maritime fuel trading centre, hosting various matchmaking events to catalyse supply chains and support our nation in reinforcing its leadership in this emerging sector.

The geopolitical landscape today affirms that the old rulebook is being rewritten. In this new chapter, Hong Kong's value proposition under ""one country, two systems"" becomes more relevant than ever after - offering a stable, sophisticated common law platform with a trusted legal framework, free flow of capital and information, as well as professional expertise that de-risks global trade. Hong Kong is here to serve and facilitate you to not just navigate today's challenges, but seize tomorrow's opportunities.

Ladies and gentlemen, while this Summit is about to conclude, I trust that the collaboration and dialogue will go on. As Hong Kong Maritime Week continues with other events, I look forward to welcoming you there.

Thank you to the ICS, our co-organisers, and all of you for your invaluable contributions. Congratulations to the ICS for, once again, hosting and staging such a successful summit this year. I wish you a productive remainder of your time in Hong Kong and enjoy the buzz and the nice weather outside of the Asia's World City. Thank you.

Speech by CE at Opening Ceremony of Hong Kong Maritime Week 2025 cum World Maritime Merchants Forum 2025

Following is the speech by the Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, at the Opening Ceremony of Hong Kong Maritime Week 2025 cum World Maritime Merchants Forum 2025 today (November 17):

Honourable Vice Chairman C Y Leung (Vice-Chairman of National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference), Honourable Director Zhou Ji (Director of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government (CPG) in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR)), Vice Minister Fu Xuyin (Vice Minister of Transport), Deputy Head Chen Feng (Deputy Head, Office for Safeguarding National Security of the CPG in the HKSAR), Acting Commissioner Li Yongsheng (Acting Commissioner of the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the HKSAR), Chairman Miao Jianmin (Chairman of China Merchants Group), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good afternoon. A very warm welcome to Hong Kong, Asia's world city, and to the opening of Hong Kong Maritime Week 2025 and the fifth World Maritime Merchants Forum, which bring together our maritime cluster, and underline Hong Kong's status as one of the world's leading maritime centres.

The theme for the Hong Kong Maritime Week, ""Navigating to a Greener Future"", signals our shared destination. Complementing this, the theme of the World Maritime Merchants Forum, ""Steering Sustainability Through Changes"", is our navigational chart for the journey ahead.

In a world being reshaped by geopolitical discord, technological disruption and climate change, these themes are more than aspirational. They sound an alarm, a wake-up call to collective action.

In this era of profound and complex transformation, Hong Kong's role as a stable, reliable and dynamic maritime hub has never been more vital. The principle of ""one country, two systems"" is the cornerstone of our success, providing us with an unshakeable foundation.

As our country's only bilingual common law jurisdiction, Hong Kong offers a simple and low tax regime, free port status and the unfettered flow of capital, information and talent.

Our standing is consistently acknowledged, and endorsed, by the international community. For the sixth consecutive year, Hong Kong ranked fourth, globally, in the International Shipping Centre Development Index. This pays tribute to our strengths in port infrastructure, maritime services and overall operating environment.

Hong Kong is home to more than 1 200 port and maritime-related companies, a thriving cluster of global leaders in ship management, finance, insurance and law. The Hong Kong Shipowners Mutual Assurance Association's launch ceremony, in just a few minutes, will mark a milestone development, further enriching our maritime services and reinforcing Hong Kong's role as a ""super-connector"" and ""super value-adder"".

Our tax concession regime for high value-added maritime services continues to attract global businesses. And we are planning to extend half-rate tax concessions to physical commodity traders, further integrating the critical pillars of trade, commodities and shipping here in Hong Kong.

Beyond our business-friendly foundations, our focus is firmly on the future. And the imperative for green growth is the defining challenge, and opportunity, of our generation.

With the International Maritime Organization's Net-Zero Framework targeting to achieve net-zero carbon emissions in international shipping by around the year 2050, Hong Kong is determined to be at the forefront, as a premier green maritime fuel-bunkering centre.

Since publishing our Action Plan on Green Maritime Fuel Bunkering a year ago, we have materialised regular commercial liquefied natural gas and biodiesel bunkering.

Our vision is to become the epicentre of the global green maritime fuel trade. And our proximity to the Chinese Mainland, the world's largest producer of green maritime fuel, is a critical advantage. We will continue to collaborate with maritime associations and business partners globally to drive the transition towards sustainability.

Indeed, collaboration on an unprecedented scale is essential as we face challenges from geopolitical tensions, trade protectionism, technological disruption, and the climate crisis - issues too vast for any single economy to solve alone.

Let's work together to build green shipping corridors and digital trade lanes that will define the future of safe, efficient and sustainable global shipping.

Ladies and gentlemen, Hong Kong is ready to be your partner. Our policy support, expertise, strategic vision and unwavering commitment can play a pivotal role in navigating the next era of shipping. Together, we can steer a course towards a more sustainable, prosperous and collaborative future.

I wish you all a rewarding Hong Kong Maritime Week, a productive World Maritime Merchants Forum, and fair winds and following seas, in business as in life.

*********************************************************************

Following is the speech by the Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, at the Hong Kong Global Maritime Trade Summit today (November 17):

Dr Emanuele Grimaldi (Chair of the International Chamber of Shipping), Your Excellencies, Ministers, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good morning. It is a pleasure to welcome you all to the second Hong Kong Global Maritime Trade Summit, co-hosted by the International Chamber of Shipping (ICS), the Hong Kong Shipowners Association, and the newly formed Hong Kong Maritime and Port Development Board.

This important event brings together more than 300 global maritime leaders from some 30 economies for vital dialogue and collaboration. Your presence speaks to the global significance of the discussions here.

I would like to thank the ICS for once again choosing Hong Kong to host this pivotal summit, casting a strong vote of confidence in us as an international maritime centre. Representing over 80 per cent of the world's merchant fleet, your leadership in shaping the global maritime agenda is unparalleled.

Building Resilience in an Age of Transformation

The theme of this Summit - ""Building Resilience, Driving Growth and Investment"" - speaks directly to our moment. Global maritime trade is no doubt facing headwinds: geopolitical tensions, tariff escalations, and new trade barriers are reshaping shipping routes and disrupting established patterns. The UNCTAD (United Nations Conference on Trade and Development) Review of Maritime Transport 2025 forecasts seaborne trade growth of merely 0.5 per cent this year, down from 2.2 per cent in 2024 - the slowest pace in years. Vessel rerouting has pushed ton-miles to record levels, forcing ships to travel longer distances at higher cost.

Yet this is not necessarily a story of decline, but of transformation. Allow me to offer three observations.

Shifting maritime trade patterns

First, in my view, geopolitics will reshape rather than weaken maritime trade flows. Consider China. It has stood as the world's largest manufacturing economy for 15 consecutive years, commanding close to 30 per cent of global manufacturing output. It has an industrial ecosystem spanning the entire classification of industrial categories recognised by the United Nations. Despite talk of supply chain diversification, no country possesses China's completeness, scale, efficiency or integrated capacity. Indeed, supply chain reconfiguration arising from trade tensions is creating a complementary, not substitutional, relationship across the region.

While Southeast Asian nations are attracting more investments and manufacturing activities, in this process, they are reinforcing the two-way trade flow with China, in raw materials, components, semi-finished goods and finished products. As a matter of fact, China-ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) trade reached a record of some US$690 billion in the first eight months of 2025. Hong Kong, as a key re-export hub, has witnessed substantial growth in this business.

As a manufacturer, China will continue to demand vast quantities of raw materials and components from Southeast Asia, Africa and the Pacific (like Australia). Meanwhile, as a consumer market of 1.4 billion people with a rapidly expanding middle income group, China will drive continued growth in the import of food, fashion, electronics, and more.

At the same time, Southeast Asia, with approximately 700 million people with a median age of 32, is experiencing a significant demographic dividend. More importantly, their incomes are rising substantially. By 2030, ASEAN will contribute 140 million new consumers, representing 16 per cent of the world's new consumer class.

Beyond Asia, the broader Global South, currently accounting for 18 per cent of global GDP, is projected to grow at 4.2 per cent annually through 2029. By 2033, South-South trade is expected to approach US$14 trillion.

I believe this economic dynamism will be reshaping maritime trade. Intra-regional trade is emerging as a powerful engine of growth. Intra-Asia container volumes are projected to reach more than 42 million TEUs (Twenty Equipment Unit) by 2028, representing 3.8 per cent growth per year, outpacing the global average.

The maritime sector itself is evolving, too. Intra-regional trade is driving demand for smaller, fuel-efficient vessels optimised for short-sea shipping. Scheduling patterns are also shifting to accommodate new supply chains and regional trade growth. Bulk commodities remain dominant in seaborne trade, and containerised cargo - including consumer electronics, automotive components, and renewable energy products - is experiencing robust growth, particularly in intra-Asia routes.

Decarbonisation as both imperative and opportunity

My second observation is that decarbonisation of maritime operations is both an imperative and opportunity. The IMO (International Maritime Organization) has set a target of achieving net-zero carbon emissions from international shipping by 2050. This is not environmental aspiration alone. It is regulatory reality.

To this end, the liner shipping industry is making substantial progress, with 79 per cent of the deadweight tonnage of container and vehicle carriers capable of operating on renewable fuels. Yet scaling green fuel production and creating financial mechanisms to support adoption remain challenging. It requires strong political commitment and cross-sectoral collaboration.

The opportunity is substantial. Maritime decarbonisation represents a multi-trillion-dollar investment opportunity through 2050. The transition to zero-emission marine fuels could create up to 4 million jobs globally across the energy supply chain. Here in Hong Kong, we are embracing this. For example, we have published an Action Plan on Green Maritime Fuel Bunkering, positioning ourselves as a regional hub for sustainable fuel supply. Our goal is to provide bunkering services for green fuels to ocean-going vessels more than 60 times per year by 2030, involving over 200 000 tonnes of green maritime fuels.

Harnessing digital transformation

My third observation is on technology's transformative power. Ports and global container lines are commonly deploying artificial intelligence, blockchain and advanced data analytics to improve operational efficiency, optimise routes, and reduce downtime and carbon emissions. This is where Hong Kong also comes in, with our vibrant technology and startup community. Many of them are pioneering innovations in smart logistics. They can play a role not only in supporting our own transformation but also in serving the broader region.

Technology is also reshaping what is shipped and how. As consumer preferences shift and companies adopt new production methods, the mode of maritime trade also evolves. Consumers are now preferring sustainable, traceable products, driving demand for supply chain solutions that can verify environmental and social credentials in real time. Besides, the speed of technology adoption in operation and management will determine competitive success in this decade. Those who are able to digitalise their operations will reduce costs, capture market share, and be better able to meet the expectations of increasingly sophisticated customers and regulators.

Concluding remarks

Ladies and gentlemen, the maritime industry stands at a pivotal moment. Geopolitical fragmentation, shifting patterns of global commerce, climate imperatives and technological advancement are formidable forces. Yet they create opportunity precisely because they demand agility, innovation and vision.

Yes, the currents are shifting, and the waters may be uncharted. But like the explorers in the Age of Discovery, there lies tremendous opportunity for those with the vision to navigate with strategy, courage and conviction. I am convinced that the voyage ahead is one of extraordinary growth for those who are willing and ready.

On this note, I wish you all a most rewarding Summit, and the best of health and business in the time ahead.

And for those of you coming from afar, I would like to appeal to you: don’t just work, but enjoy the city. We have wonderful hiking trails, beaches, about 200 Michelin-recommended restaurants, great museums, and above all, we don’t impose duty on wine! And remember to shop till you drop! Thank you.

This year’s Forum took place with physical attendance at the Eugenides Foundation and was broadcast live worldwide, attracting hundreds of viewers and Members from the Institute’s 27 international Branches.

In her opening remarks, Ms. Natalia Margioli-Komninou, Managing Director of HMC & ICS Greek Branch, reflected on the Branch’s 20-year journey of promoting education and professionalism. She highlighted its vital role in shaping generations of maritime professionals through knowledge-sharing and networking. Ms. Margioli emphasized the importance of the ICS community – a network built on trust, respect, and a shared passion for shipping – and presented two major new initiatives; The Company Membership Scheme allows organizations to connect, access professional training, and tap into ICS’s global network, creating growth opportunities for both individuals and companies. The partnership with the Chartered Management Institute (CMI) offers management and leadership programmes that equip professionals with essential soft skills for success in today’s global markets.

Both aim to foster leadership development and enhance the professional capacity of individuals and organizations within the maritime industry. She concluded by reaffirming the Branch’s mission to continue growing alongside the sector and to uphold its core values of learning, collaboration, and excellence.

In his welcome address, Mr. Nikolas Tsavliris, Chairman of the ICS Greek Branch, spoke with heartfelt emotion and deep respect, describing the 20th ICS Annual Forum as not only a milestone but a moment for gratitude and reflection. He underlined the Forum’s role as a platform for meaningful discussion in today’s complex and fragmented world. Drawing inspiration from the original Greek concept of dialogos, Mr. Tsavliris highlighted that dialogue is not a contest of opinions, but a shared pursuit of understanding, the very essence of the ICS mission.

The panel discussion, moderated with great insight by Mr. Simon Ward, FICS, Director, Ursa Shipbrokers, brought together a distinguished lineup of speakers:

Mr. Polys V. Hajioannou, Chairman & CEO, Safe Bulkers Inc., and President, Cyprus Union of Shipowners

Mr. George G. Mangos, Principal, Interunity Group

Ms. Ismini Panagiotidi, CEO & Founder, Pavimar S.A. and Icon Energy Corp.

Ms. Milena Pappa, Board Member & Commercial Director, Star Bulk Carriers Corp.

Mr. Thanasis Martinos, Managing Director of Eastern Mediterranean Maritime Ltd., contributed to the forum via a pre-recorded video message.

The conversation covered key pillars shaping the shipping industry today — market outlook, geopolitics, environmental regulation (IMO & emissions), and professional development.

In his remarks, Mr Martinos noted that shipping is going through challenging times, and highlighted early indications that freight rates for VLCCs, Capesize bulk carriers, and container ships are expected to be higher next year. He added that he believes future freight market forecasts will become increasingly accurate as AI-enhanced econometric modeling continues to evolve.

Mr Hajioannou highlighted that many shipowners remain skeptical of the current IMO Net-Zero Framework and emphasized the long-term strategic impact of China’s dominance in shipbuilding. He stressed the need for coordinated dialogue among leading maritime nations to manage this structural imbalance. He also described shipping as a dynamic industry offering exceptional opportunities for professional growth. Mr Mangos cautioned against adopting unrealistic decarbonisation targets and noted that geopolitical volatility makes long-term commercial planning challenging. He highlighted the differing capacities of the liner and tramp sectors to influence global policy and stressed the importance of navigating market interdependencies carefully.

Ms Pappa focused on the technical and regulatory challenges facing decarbonisation, including green fuel incentives, lifecycle assessments, and fuel costs. She highlighted progress made through engine efficiency improvements but stressed the need for modern port infrastructure and scalable alternative fuels. Last, she highligted that personal integrity and transparency, alongside technical competence, are essential for anyone seeking a career in shipping. Ms Panagiotidi noted how commercial decision-making now requires constant adaptation to geopolitical uncertainty. She added that shipowners have historically had to make decisions under disruption, and recent developments have further shaken traditional decision-making frameworks in the industry. She observed that formal qualifications remain essential, but success increasingly depends on navigating complex markets with skill and foresight.

Pacific Environment’s climate policy director, Davina Hurt, said, “Now is the time to act”.","Following last month’s one year delay to the Net Zero Framework (NZF) NGO’s are demanding that governments take decisive action to accelerate the industry’s decarbonisation plans.

A US-led coalition scuppered the IMO’s attempts to agree a comprehensive road map that would see shipping substantially reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to a fraction of those recorded in 2008.

The IMO set out a clear pathway to 2050 with interim targets for 2030 and 2040 with many nation states already committed to delivering the reductions in emissions and many vessel operators investing in the green technology that will achieve the industry’s goals.

In a move that will find support from many in the maritime sector, five NGO’s, Environmental Defense Fund, Pacific Environment, Seas At Risk, Solutions for Our Climate, and Transport & Environment, have set out a six-point action plan that they are calling on governments to commit to in a bid to make sure that the maritime meets its climate obligations.

The plan calls for governments to: Develop and implement a national action plan on international shipping emissions. Set clear domestic targets and mandates for low- and zero-emission marine fuels and vessels. Deploy financial and regulatory incentives to accelerate ship efficiency and fuel transition. Enhance port infrastructure and support for alternative fuels, as well as technologies such as wind propulsion and electrification. Ensure a just and globally equitable transition, especially for developing and small-island nations and support urgent action on short-lived climate forcers (methane and black carbon) emitted by international shipping.

Postponement of the NZF was a disappointment for many within and outside the industry but John Yum, head of shipping team at Solutions for Our Climate, argues that individual states can still take action to reduce emissions by expanding green corridors or investing in zero or near zero fuels. He said: “Taking proactive steps now will demonstrate governments’ commitment to achieving net-zero shipping by 2050 and help ensure that, when the IMO reconvenes, it can move forward with stronger ambition rather than face another setback.” Meanwhile, Pacific Environment believe that overshooting the Paris target of limiting Earth’s warming to 1.5degs has already been missed and blames “bad actors” for “bullying” countries into inaction.

Brazil was confident global unity would prevail at November's climate talks, but the exceptionally undiplomatic scenes at the International Maritime Organization (IMO), the UN shipping regulator, presented an uglier possibility.

Even with the United States skipping the climate summit, President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva called for good faith negotiations at COP30 and a rejection of the ""pressure and threats"" witnessed at the IMO.

Washington's conduct -- threatening sanctions, visa freezes and port levies on nations that didn't vote its way -- was not ""typical"" of the IMO, Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez told AFP.

AFP interviewed Dominguez, a Panamanian nearly halfway through his four-year term as IMO chief, at COP30 in Belem. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

Q: The shipping carbon price was expected to be approved until US officials threatened retaliation against nations to get the vote delayed. Is this normal conduct at the IMO?

A: ""In my 28 years I have never experienced that kind of meeting at the IMO. It was not a typical IMO meeting. Geopolitical situations around the world right now are different to where they were in the past. We all know that.

""But for me, the task is to keep the momentum, maintain the approach, and whenever we come back to the negotiations in future, I call on everyone to do it in the normal spirit of compromise and cooperation that we carry out at IMO.""

Q: How can the IMO's 176 member states rebuild trust after this?

A: ""I can tell you that multilateralism is very much alive at IMO. And that's what I told everyone -- not to judge the organization, or come too quickly to conclusions, from the outcome of one specific topic in one specific meeting.

""For us, we need to learn from it. I am very much in support of multilateralism. We have had conversations and discussions about how to deal with geopolitical aspects.""

Q: US President Donald Trump called the shipping emissions deal a ""scam"" and pressure from Washington clearly influenced its delay. Is the scheme dead?

A: ""The negotiations continue, and they are ongoing. It is by no means a done deal. The process will continue ahead.

""It is important to take their comments and concerns on board, and have further bilateral and multilateral conversations ahead of the next session. They may have proposals to put on the table for us to consider as well. And that's how we make progress.

""I work with all countries, and all governments, at any given time. My job is to listen to what everybody is saying and see how we can accommodate and find those common areas that might allow us to make progress.""

Q: Is the industry still committed to decarbonizing?

A: ""Our goal -- that we all agree at IMO back in 2023 -- is to decarbonize the sector by around 2050. And we all maintain that goal, regardless of the state of play right now. We continue to make progress... and I am convinced actually that the organization is serious about decarbonizing by around 2050.""

Pinnington released the latest edition of Making Waves November 4 through publisher Rethink Press.

Pinnington said the book is the result of a year’s worth of research and interviews. It also includes a new in-depth section on the U.S. maritime industry, as well as new chapters on maritime technology, the maritime media, AI and public relations, social media and crisis communications.

“Maritime now has its highest profile in decades, and this is an opportunity and threat,” he said. “As we have seen with President Trump challenging China’s maritime industry and with the IMO Net Zero framework being paused, maritime is now front and center of the news agenda.”

Companies within the maritime industry historically have endeavored to keep a low profile, but that approach may need to change, Pinnington argues in “Making Waves.”

“Times have changed, and maritime needs to start prioritizing professional communications to build authentic reputation and trust,” he said.

A big part of that story is the industry-wide effort and cost associated with decarbonization and how technology and alternative fuels are driving down emissions.

Pinnington said the book is further aimed at maritime business leaders who want to professionalize their communications.

“I want ‘Making Waves II’ to give proven ideas so businesses can better do themselves justice,” he said. “The hard reality is that many maritime firms do not have the reputation they deserve. They are trapped in repeating the same year with minimal growth and average marketing.

As informed, the engine uses the Diesel principle combined with dual-fuel Liquid Gas Injection technology, similar to prior engines running on methanol and LPG. The engine incorporates safety features specific to ammonia, including containment systems, sensors, system ventilation, and double-walled piping.

Ammonia as a marine fuel has several technical advantages, Everllence explains. It produces zero CO₂ when derived from renewable sources and has low sulphur-oxide and particulate emissions. Its high volumetric energy density allows more compact storage compared with hydrogen, and it can be stored as a liquid at moderate pressures. Ammonia’s slow combustion rate is compatible with two-stroke engine designs, and existing global production infrastructure supports scalability and operational reliability.

The first engine is expected to be operational in 2026, with testing and bedding-in scheduled beforehand. Extensive testing has already been conducted, including over 800 trials since mid-2023, with safety measures reviewed alongside relevant authorities.

The ME-LGIA engine will support digital connectivity to allow real-time monitoring, performance optimization, and operational data collection.

As the maritime industry’s leading engine designer, we are in a unique position to advance the green transition and know that bringing new fuels to market is not just innovation – it’s imperative for zero-carbon shipping. In this context, ammonia is a vital piece of the puzzle. The development of this engine is not just a technical achievement; it is another concrete step towards a climate-neutral future where the time to act is now

According to Besley-Gould, SSI continues to deliver on its road map set across six key areas-- oceans, people, community, finance, transparency and energy, including Scope 3 emissions.
Less than 10% of ship steel remains traceable to high-quality reuse or low-carbon steelmaking routes, with the vast majority downcycled into low-value applications, she added.
Additionally, green and digital shipping corridors, such as the Singapore-Long Beach, were ""brilliant examples"" of promoting maritime decarbonization, according to Besley-Gould.
SSI would now like to look at how a similar approach could be taken to integrate co-benefits, Besley-Gould said.","A clear opportunity exists to expand the maritime sector's decarbonization focus to the embodied environmental impacts of ship materials, beginning with the circularity potential of steel and pathways toward greener steel, said Ellie Besley-Gould, CEO of the Sustainable Shipping Initiative.

""A huge transition is happening, with genuine market signals from the industry to achieve maritime decarbonization,"" Besley-Gould told Platts, part of S&P Global Commodity Insights, in an interview.

""Our members, who include very forward-thinking industry players, are leading the industry by acting on their carbon footprint and are calling upon the SSI to identify and fill in gaps where uncertainty remains,"" she said via an e-mail on Nov. 13.

According to Besley-Gould, SSI continues to deliver on its road map set across six key areas-- oceans, people, community, finance, transparency and energy, including Scope 3 emissions.

So, SSI is also focusing on ship life cycle management, among other aspects, she said.

Steel is the dominant material in ships, accounting for about 70%-90% of a ship's total mass and driving one of the largest shares of Scope 3 emissions, factoring in extraction, refining and manufacturing, Besley-Gould said.

As a major wave of ship retirements approaches, about 150 million metric tons of ship steel will become available for recycling before 2032, she said, adding that this was a ""strategic climate lever"" that falls within this decade rather than after 2050.

According to Besley-Gould, with the Hong Kong Convention entering into force in 2025, a global minimum standard is now in place, providing greater confidence to invest in upgraded recycling capacity.

Using recovered marine steel in electric arc furnace production can reduce life cycle emissions by up to 90% compared with using new primary steel made from iron ore. However, today, the system mostly fails to capture that benefit, she said.

Less than 10% of ship steel remains traceable to high-quality reuse or low-carbon steelmaking routes, with the vast majority downcycled into low-value applications, she added.

One of the major hurdles is timing, according to Besley-Gould.

End-of-life decisions are often made in the last months of operation when the original owner has already lost leverage, she said. At that point, recycling becomes a cost rather than an opportunity, she said.

""On the demand side, what we need to see is fleet owners looking for green steel in their supply chain... And on the supply side, we would love ship owners to be thinking about recycling ships at midlife instead of end-of-life so that we can start well,"" she added.

Circularity is most achievable when embedded from design through to end-of-life, not just at the point of recycling, she said.

Coordination across the shipping and steel sectors, supported by global and regional regulations, and de-risking demand-generating policies are also vital to close material loops, she added.

Additionally, SSI is undertaking significant work on marine biodiversity and ocean health. This includes linking biofouling to energy efficiency, the impact of slow steaming on underwater radiated noise and whale strikes, as well as human impact, such as the mariners' welfare, Besley-Gould said.

Shipping's transformative pathway

The delay in the International Maritime Organization Net-Zero Framework ratification was disappointing, Besley-Gould said.

""The IMO MEPC83 outcome has, of course, maintained a level of uncertainty... There is still unpredictability over whether it is possible to have an incentivization scheme and whether the reward mechanism is appropriate, what it should ideally look like, and how the carbon tax proceeds would be spent,"" she said.

""I think while the mechanism would have accelerated the transition, it is nevertheless underway,"" she said, adding that a huge opportunity exists for shipping to not just transform itself but become a transformative industry that inspires others.

SSI is working with its members to explore how best to support net zero while continuing to deliver on its road map, she said.

""Although SSI remains fuel-agnostic, it highlights a wide range of alternative fuels under consideration -- from LNG and bio-based fuels to methanol, ammonia and synthetic options -- underscoring the need to evaluate each on sustainability criteria across the full fuel life cycle,"" she added.

""If we can combine energy efficiency with clean fuels, then there is kind of a double win,"" she said, referring to measures such as slow steaming, wind sails, hull coating and bubble lubrication.

Additionally, green and digital shipping corridors, such as the Singapore-Long Beach, were ""brilliant examples"" of promoting maritime decarbonization, according to Besley-Gould.

In 2023, the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore, the Port of Los Angeles and the Port of Long Beach unveiled a partnership strategy for a Green and Digital Shipping Corridor across the Pacific Ocean.

SSI would now like to look at how a similar approach could be taken to integrate co-benefits, Besley-Gould said. ""So, how would slow steaming not only reduce emissions but also noise levels and whale strikes? Can one also implement human-side excellence and track crew welfare?""

""It will be exciting when we see emissions data and other things that the GDSCs are measuring, to extrapolate it to scale and see what is possible,"" she added.",https://www.spglobal.com/content/dam/spglobal/ci/en/images/platts/general/favicon.ico,N,,2025-11-14 11:57:09.012803

We call on all member states and zero-emission leaders like California to step up and act on climate change by truly decarbonizing maritime shipping.
The International Maritime Organization’s Net-Zero Framework is rooted in this reality.
The future of the industry is not in its past—it begins with action today.” Sian Prior, Shipping Director, Seas At Risk, said: “We simply cannot afford to keep delaying climate action.
Full Report Sources: Environmental Defense Fund, Pacific Environment, Seas At Risk, Solutions for Our Climate, and Transport & Environment","On Energy and Transport Day at COP 30, Environmental Defense Fund, Pacific Environment, Seas At Risk, Solutions for Our Climate, and Transport & Environment call on national governments to urgently accelerate action to reduce shipping emissions, especially following the recent U.S.-led postponement in the adoption of a binding global shipping measure at the International Maritime Organization (IMO). The delay in adoption of the IMO Net-Zero Framework (NZF), the first UN-mandated fuel mandate and carbon pricing mechanism on any sector, by one year risks slowing down industry-wide decarbonisation efforts at a moment when decisive action is needed most.

Shipping accounts for roughly 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions, and the IMO’s 2023 Strategy sets a clear pathway to achieve net-zero emissions from shipping by 2050, with interim goals for 2030 and 2040 that countries have already committed to deliver. While Member States continue negotiations on the NZF, national governments must step up and act domestically and regionally to keep the transition on course, ensuring investment, infrastructure, and innovation continue to drive the industry forward.

We therefore call on all governments to commit to the following national actions for shipping decarbonisation:

Develop and implement a national action plan on international shipping emissions

Set clear domestic targets and mandates for low- and zero-emission marine fuels and vessels

Deploy financial and regulatory incentives to accelerate ship efficiency and fuel transition

Enhance port infrastructure and support for alternative fuels, as well as technologies such as wind propulsion and electrification

Ensure a just and globally equitable transition, especially for developing and small-island nations

Support urgent action on short-lived climate forcers (methane and black carbon) emitted by international shipping

John Yum, Head of Shipping Team, Solutions for Our Climate, said: “The postponement of the IMO’s Net Zero Framework is deeply disappointing, but it also gives governments a chance to take meaningful action. Instead of just waiting for international negotiations to resume, countries like Korea should take immediate steps to decarbonize their shipping sectors — for instance, by continuing to commit to expanding green shipping corridors and increasing investment in ZNZ fuels. Taking proactive steps now will demonstrate governments’ commitment to achieving net-zero shipping by 2050 and help ensure that, when the IMO reconvenes, it can move forward with stronger ambition rather than face another setback.”

Davina Hurt, Climate Policy Director, Pacific Environment, said: “We now face a reality we long anticipated — overshooting the 1.5°C target is inevitable. Member states were bullied into delaying the International Maritime Organization’s Net-Zero Framework, but obstruction by bad actors cannot continue to force inaction at a time when decisive action is most needed. We call on all member states and zero-emission leaders like California to step up and act on climate change by truly decarbonizing maritime shipping. There is only one planet. We must stand together for the health of our ocean and for future generations. Now is the time to act.”

Mark Brownstein, Senior Vice President, Energy Transition, Environmental Defense Fund, said: “The development and deployment of clean, alternative fuels for global shipping is not only good for stabilizing the climate and improving public health—it also creates economic opportunities for those countries and companies that embrace innovation. The International Maritime Organization’s Net-Zero Framework is rooted in this reality. Leaders can and must act now to implement it. The future of the industry is not in its past—it begins with action today.”

Sian Prior, Shipping Director, Seas At Risk, said: “We simply cannot afford to keep delaying climate action. In the face of the climate crisis, countries need to start taking leaps, not steps, towards decarbonising shipping, including addressing short-lived climate pollutants such as methane and black carbon. Meanwhile, bullying tactics must be called out and multilateralism must take precedence. Steering the ship towards greener shipping doesn’t have to be overcomplicated: scaling up wind propulsion, finding financial incentives to adopt cleaner fuels whilst ensuring a just transition are achievable if we all work together.”

As the global community gathers in Belém, we urge governments to seize this opportunity to take concrete actions that will ensure the maritime industry contributes its fair share to combating climate change.

Early preparation around these regimes is closely tied to maintaining their competitive position.

Ahead of his contribution to the Tanker 2030 conference in Singapore, Bureau Veritas Marine & Offshore global market leader for tankers Robert Elliot described how operators had to make informed choices on fuel sourcing and pooling, alongside carefully managing operational performance.

He set out two main pathways for owners: securing access to sustainable fuels, which offers greater control and relative stability, or joining pooling agreements that provide flexibility but depend on robust contracts to manage price volatility.

Mr Elliot noted the best balance between these approaches depends on a vessel’s trading profile and fuel options, including access to alternative energy sources, and the ability to anticipate and model these factors had become a commercial capability rather than a narrow compliance task.

It includes international regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from ships from 2023 and contains two key elements: a global fuel standard and a global mechanism for pricing ship emissions.
The Trump administration had - predictably - previously threatened IMO member states with severe legal sanctions if they supported the MEPC's draft CO2 emissions regulations.
From the US government's perspective, the framework is tantamount to a ""European-led neo-colonial export of global climate regulation"".
This is because, by and large, the new net zero framework, even if it is not usually discussed as a ""tax"", will be the first and only global financial sanction for carbon emissions.","The Marine Environmental Protection Committee (MEPC) of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) in London has postponed the vote on the net zero framework and CO2 taxation. The extraordinary meeting is to be resumed in 12 months. In the meantime, the member states want to continue working towards a consensus on the regulations.

The IMO's net zero framework was included as a new chapter in the draft revision of Annex VI of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL) at the 83rd session of the MEPC in April 2025. However, without the USA, which did not attend this meeting. It includes international regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from ships from 2023 and contains two key elements: a global fuel standard and a global mechanism for pricing ship emissions.

The Trump administration had - predictably - previously threatened IMO member states with severe legal sanctions if they supported the MEPC's draft CO2 emissions regulations. Promoting ""activist-driven climate policies"" under the IMO net-zero framework could lead to sanctions, tariffs, port fees, economic sanctions related to US government contracts or visa restrictions for seafarers, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy warned in a joint statement ahead of the meeting.

From the US government's perspective, the framework is tantamount to a ""European-led neo-colonial export of global climate regulation"". This is because, by and large, the new net zero framework, even if it is not usually discussed as a ""tax"", will be the first and only global financial sanction for carbon emissions. The US announcement then includes a rather blunt threat to penalise countries that vote in favour of the IMO's carbon tax scheme by imposing costs on them. ""Our colleagues in the IMO should brace themselves,"" warned the US ministers.

Speaking at the 19th Greener Shipping Summit on Tuesday, the head of the Marine Technical Managers Association (Martecma), Panos Kourkountis, argued that “with the technology we have now, we can reduce emissions by 50%.
“We need some other action, other regulations to support something different from alternative fuels.
Looking forward, he said IMO should shift focus on re-engagement and consensus-building among member states.

Speaking at the 19th Greener Shipping Summit on Tuesday, the head of the Marine Technical Managers Association (Martecma), Panos Kourkountis, argued that “with the technology we have now, we can reduce emissions by 50%. Unless we have new technologies, we must move forward with what we have now.”

Kourkountis, who is also the Technical Director at Sea Traders, explained that only 1% of the amount of fuel required for shipping by the controversial IMO Net-Zero Framework that got postponed in October is available at this time, and producing that fuel is not something we could do “the very next day,” he emphasized, adding that the energy required to produce ammonia and methanol would be greater than the energy they generate.

“We need some other action, other regulations to support something different from alternative fuels. We do not have energy from batteries, while nuclear energy is not ready to be applied, even though it would certainly solve the global energy problem, but environmentally the problem remains, since nuclear waste exists,” he said.

Echoing those views, ABS Business Development Manager Angelos Minakis presented the key points of contention in IMO, saying the organization has made a strategic mistake by condemning liquefied natiural gas while theoretically other fuels don’t exist. Looking forward, he said IMO should shift focus on re-engagement and consensus-building among member states.

For his part, Miltiadis Varvitsiotis, vice president and CEO of Skaramangas Shipyards, argued that US opposition to IMO’s Net-Zero Framework poses a unique opportunity for the Greek shipbuilding industry, especially for Skaramangas, as the shipyards will be certified next year to serve LNG carriers and such vessels are expected to travel the Eastern Mediterranean region to export American LNG.

Leaders can and must act now to implement it.
As the global community gathers in Belém, we urge governments to seize this opportunity to take concrete actions that will ensure the maritime industry contributes its fair share to combating climate change.
… the NGOs concluded.","According to a statement by Environmental Defense Fund, Pacific Environment, Seas At Risk, Solutions for Our Climate, and Transport & Environment, the U.S.-led postponement delay in adoption of the IMO Net-Zero Framework (NZF), the first UN-mandated fuel mandate and carbon pricing mechanism on any sector, by one year risks slowing down industry-wide decarbonization efforts at a moment when decisive action is needed most.

While Member States continue negotiations on the NZF, national governments must step up and act domestically and regionally to keep the transition on course, ensuring investment, infrastructure, and innovation continue to drive the industry forward. The NGOs therefore call on all governments to commit to the following national actions for shipping decarbonization:

Develop and implement a national action plan on international shipping emissions

Set clear domestic targets and mandates for low- and zero-emission marine fuels and vessels

Deploy financial and regulatory incentives to accelerate ship efficiency and fuel transition

Enhance port infrastructure and support for alternative fuels, as well as technologies such as wind propulsion and electrification

Ensure a just and globally equitable transition, especially for developing and small-island nations

Support urgent action on short-lived climate forcers (methane and black carbon) emitted by international shipping

Taking proactive steps now will demonstrate governments’ commitment to achieving net-zero shipping by 2050 and help ensure that, when the IMO reconvenes, it can move forward with stronger ambition rather than face another setback

… said John Yum, Head of Shipping Team, Solutions for Our Climate

Meanwhile, Davina Hurt, Climate Policy Director, Pacific Environment, highlighted that member states were bullied into delaying the International Maritime Organization’s Net-Zero Framework, but obstruction by bad actors cannot continue to force inaction at a time when decisive action is most needed.

The International Maritime Organization’s Net-Zero Framework is rooted in this reality. Leaders can and must act now to implement it. The future of the industry is not in its past—it begins with action today

… commented Mark Brownstein, Senior Vice President, Energy Transition, Environmental Defense Fund

Sian Prior, Shipping Director, Seas At Risk, expressed the opinion that steering the ship towards greener shipping doesn’t have to be overcomplicated: scaling up wind propulsion, finding financial incentives to adopt cleaner fuels whilst ensuring a just transition are achievable if we all work together.

As the global community gathers in Belém, we urge governments to seize this opportunity to take concrete actions that will ensure the maritime industry contributes its fair share to combating climate change.
