Reward level-setting – determining the timing, size, and distribution of rewards What are the various design options for the reward mechanism?","In October 2025, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) is expected to adopt its Net-Zero Framework, which would enter into force in 2027. The framework’s supporting guidelines will define zero- and near-zero-emission fuels, reward mechanisms, emissions accounting, certification, and how a central fund will be governed. These guidelines will be crucial in further supporting the energy transition and ensuring a just and equitable transition.

A recent Global Maritime Forum insight brief provides an analysis and explanation of the IMO’s reward mechanism. This guide—written before October’s expected adoption—summarises its key takeaways.

Why is a reward mechanism for e-fuels in shipping needed?

Through the Net-Zero Framework, shipping emissions will be slowly restricted over time through Global Fuel Intensity (GFI) targets, which are measured in a ship’s annual greenhouse gas emissions per unit of energy used. The GFI promotes gradual decarbonisation and transitional technologies but is unlikely to sufficiently incentivise long-term solutions such as e-fuels early on. This is why a reward mechanism is needed.

It is projected that by 2030, the IMO will raise around $11–12 billion annually through penalties from non-compliance with the framework. These funds will then be channelled into rewards for zero- and near-zero-emission (ZNZ) fuels and support a just, equitable transition in which no country or region is left behind.

The IMO reward mechanism can be further tailored to provide financial incentives for using ZNZ fuels. Tailoring rewards to scalable solutions such as e-fuels can help close their competitiveness gap with transitional fuels, such as liquefied natural gas or biofuels.

Why is it important to support e-fuels in shipping?

To keep the shipping sector on track to achieve its stated goal of net-zero emissions by 2050, at least 5% of the industry’s energy demand should be met by scalable alternatives, such as e-fuels, by 2030. E-fuels are critical because they provide a scalable pathway to decarbonise global shipping.

To realise this potential, it’s important to build out the maritime value chain early on so different segments can de-risk one another, enable uptake at scale, and support full commercialisation in the long run. However, e-fuels face high upfront costs and uncertain returns.

E-fuel producers need affordable financing, but shipping companies (offtakers) are hesitant to commit to long-term contracts due to limited supply and unclear price trends. At the same time, investors generally seek quick, low-risk returns, which e-fuels cannot currently provide. This mismatch, often described as the sector’s ‘chicken-and-egg problem’, makes e-fuel growth difficult without policy intervention.

What are the key components of the IMO’s reward mechanism?

The impact of the reward will be driven by two main components of the reward:

Fuel eligibility – defining which fuels qualify for rewards.

Reward level-setting – determining the timing, size, and distribution of rewards

What are the various design options for the reward mechanism?

According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, four key criteria should be considered when evaluating the feasibility and efficiency of a climate-related policy: environmental effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, distributional considerations, and institutional feasibility. Translated into a shipping context, that looks like the following:

Investment certainty (Environmental effectiveness): Shipowners need long-term revenue assurance, especially for high-risk commitments like e-fuels which entail long-term offtake agreements, to confidently invest in zero-emission fuels.

Price discovery (Cost-effectiveness): It’s essential to ensure transparent pricing of alternative fuels in emerging markets to prevent both under- and over-subsidisation.

Accessibility (Distributional considerations): Rewards should be accessible to shipowners across regions and income levels to ensure the system does not disproportionately benefit larger companies.

Institutional feasibility:

1. Limiting liability: Fund allocations must be controlled so demand for rewards does not exceed what is actually available.

2. Administrative burden: The mechanism should be practical for the IMO to implement and manage.

3. Political feasibility: The system needs to align with IMO principles and remain politically viable.

What is important to consider when determining fuel eligibility?

There are three main ways the IMO could choose to determine which fuels are eligible under its rewards scheme:

Technology-centric, based on the fuel’s production pathway (e.g., e-fuels, biofuels)

Emission-centric, based on greenhouse gas intensity

Hybrid, a combination of both approaches.

According to the insight brief, the best way for the rewards mechanism to deliver a positive impact on the four considerations outlined above would be through either a technology-centric or a hybrid approach. These approaches would limit the scope of eligible fuels and specifically target e-fuels while significantly increasing investment certainty in the long-term fuels and limiting the liability of the reward fund.

How can the rewards be set, and what are the costs and benefits?

Reward levels can be determined in three main ways, each of which has its trade-offs:

Administratively-set rates: A flat administrative annual rate is simple and predictable. However, this approach does not allow the market to discover its most efficient pricing. There is also a risk that payouts could exceed the fund’s assets, creating a potential liability. Finally, an annual fixed rate does not give shipowners long-term certainty, which can undermine investor confidence. However, both these risks could be mitigated by distributing a limited number of multi-year, fixed-rate rewards, which would offer investment certainty while limiting liability.

Auction-based rewards: With an auction, multi-year rewards are allocated through competitive bidding. The shipowners that win auctions will have investment certainty since they know their reward upfront for multiple years. Because auctions are based on a set volume, there’s no risk that the fund amount is exceeded. Plus, competition drives price discovery of the rewarded fuel. A downside of auctions is their complexity, as they can’t be too strict (otherwise shipowners won’t apply) or too loose (as companies may pull out later). They’re also a heavy administrative and technical burden for the IMO.

Hybrid models: With a hybrid model, rewards are linked to external benchmarks and could incorporate both administrative and auction-based mechanisms. For example, using ‘contracts for difference’ would involve paying out the cost difference between the conventional fuel and the fuel being rewarded. This is controlled by setting a cap for the rewarded fuel, either administratively or through auction. With this approach, shipowners have certainty about what their new fuel will cost. It also simultaneously closes the cost gap directly. However, there is still a risk of exceeding the fund limits since total payouts depend on the price fluctuations of the conventional fuel. It also adds complexity for both the shipowner and IMO administration.

What is the predicted timeline for the rewards?",,N,,2025-10-03 06:57:20.501120

The programme covers over 1,500 completed projects and another 1,000 planned by 2027, with investment costs shared between Maersk and vessel owners. Maersk views this as a win-win: the company lowers its fuel use and emissions, while owners benefit from modernised, more competitive ships.

Many of these ships were designed and constructed at a time when container vessels in general were sailing at faster speeds. To bring down fuel consumption, we have over the years introduced less compressed vessel schedules, but the propellers and bulbs optimized for faster speeds have been kept. There lies a big efficiency potential in replacing them

Once they crunched the data, they found that most of the new pollution would be concentrated in the world’s northern shipping corridors.
Under the IMO plan, Arctic emissions would still rise to about 1.3 megatonnes by 2070.
Only the net-zero approach, which requires strict zero-emission fuels such as hydrogen, electricity, or nuclear propulsion, eliminates Arctic emissions entirely by 2100.","As the Arctic warms and sea ice retreats, once-impassable waters at the top of the globe will increasingly open to commercial shipping, something that could cause a surge in emissions, says a new study.

The research looks at the Arctic Sea Route (ASR), made up of three major passages: Russia’s Northern Sea Route, Canada’s Northwest Passage through the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, and the Central Arctic Route, which would cut straight across the North Pole once year-round sea ice has thinned enough to allow navigation.

Many shipping companies have hailed these emerging routes as a climate win, arguing that fewer days at sea mean less fuel burned and lower emissions.

But instead of cutting pollution, the Arctic shortcuts could drive a sharp increase in global shipping emissions, while concentrating climate impacts in the northern hemisphere, the research said.

“Our results indicate that access to the ASR will increase global shipping emissions by 8.2 per cent by 2100,” the study’s authors said.

“In the Arctic itself, emissions are projected to rise from just 0.22 per cent of the global total to 2.72 per cent.”

Shorter routes, but more ships

The opening up of the Arctic Sea Route is something that could shorten voyages between Europe and Northeast Asia by up to 40 per cent, cutting travel times by nearly two weeks in some cases.

But the Chinese study, published this week in the journal Nature, said that while individual journeys would use less fuel, overall traffic would grow — especially from oil, gas, and chemical tankers.

The researchers’ modeling found that by 2100, it’s possible Arctic voyages could number over 500,000, making the region a global shipping hub.

“Although access to the ASR reduces voyage distances, these efficiency gains will be overwhelmed by the scale of increased traffic growth,” the study said.

A northern shift in emissions

To do the study, the researchers built a computer model that combined global trade forecasts, Arctic shipping routes, and billions of ship-tracking signals and trade data. Then they tested different scenarios and how they would be affected by different climate policies, to estimate how much pollution the new Arctic routes would generate.

Once they crunched the data, they found that most of the new pollution would be concentrated in the world’s northern shipping corridors.

“Nearly all of the additional carbon burden is concentrated in the Northern Hemisphere (over 98 per cent),” the study said.

“Environmental disparities in exposure to emissions will increase since Northeast Asia, Northern Europe, and North America will experience particularly large increases in emissions due to rerouted shipping flows.”

By contrast, the Suez and Panama Canals may see slight declines, the study said.

Testing climate policies

The team also evaluated how three climate policy strategies could affect the outcomes: the International Maritime Organization’s 2023 emissions strategy (which sets new targets for shipping and assumes a global shift toward low- and zero-carbon fuels), the Green Corridor strategy that promotes clean fuels on selected routes, and a net-zero strategy.

Under the IMO plan, Arctic emissions would still rise to about 1.3 megatonnes by 2070. The Green Corridor strategy performed slightly better but created a “rebound effect” — where ships rerouted to less regulated areas, leading to a 22 per cent rise in global emissions when the ASR is used.

“Our evaluation of decarbonization strategies also indicates that current international efforts fall short of mitigating ASR-induced emissions, particularly in the Arctic,” the researchers said.

Only the net-zero approach, which requires strict zero-emission fuels such as hydrogen, electricity, or nuclear propulsion, eliminates Arctic emissions entirely by 2100.

“Partial or geographically constrained policies cannot safeguard the Arctic from long-term emissions growth,” the authors said.

But the researchers added that even net-zero wouldn’t protect the North from the knock-on effects of a ship traffic boom.

Increased noise pollution, oil spill hazards, and invasive species carried in ballast water are all things that could also impact the fragile polar ecosystems and the Arctic communities that depend on them.

“Realizing a sustainable maritime future requires harmonized global governance,” the study said, something they say would ensure that “… economic gains do not come at the expense of irreversible harm to one of the planet’s most climate-sensitive regions.”

For ITOCHU, this successful bunkering operation in Ulsan is a critical milestone in its broader corporate strategy.","In a significant step towards decarbonizing the maritime sector, ITOCHU Corporation announced on September 30, 2025, the successful supply of low-carbon methanol fuel to a vessel operated by NYK Line. The bunkering operation—the process of supplying fuel to a ship—was performed via the ship-to-ship (STS) bunkering method for the Green Future, a methanol dual-fuel bulk carrier regularly chartered by NYK Group company NYK Bulk & Projects Carriers Ltd. The operation took place on September 28 at the Port of Ulsan in South Korea.

The marine transportation industry is under increasing pressure to reduce its significant share of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. With the global economy expanding and cargo volumes projected to rise, the swift adoption of alternative, low-carbon marine fuels is an urgent necessity. This bunkering operation directly supports the ambitious targets set by international and national bodies. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has established a strategy aiming for net-zero GHG emissions from international shipping by around 2050. Simultaneously, the Japanese government is promoting alternative fuels as part of its goal to reduce GHG emissions by 46% versus the fiscal 2013 level by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.

The low-carbon methanol fuel supplied by ITOCHU is produced from biomass-derived raw materials, resulting in a fuel whose life cycle GHG emissions are expected to be significantly lower than those of conventional fossil fuels, such as heavy oil. This characteristic is crucial for shipping companies like NYK Line that are committed to transitioning their fleets.

Methanol's increasing popularity as a marine fuel is driven by several key advantages. It is a liquid at normal atmospheric temperatures and pressures, which means it can be handled using relatively minor modifications to existing bunkering and storage infrastructure. This ease of integration significantly lowers the barrier to entry for its widespread adoption. The growing number of dual-fuel carriers, which can run on both methanol and conventional heavy oil, further underscores the industry's commitment to this fuel pathway.

For ITOCHU, this successful bunkering operation in Ulsan is a critical milestone in its broader corporate strategy. The company is actively working to accelerate the development of a comprehensive supply chain for low-carbon alternative fuels within the marine transportation sector. This initiative is being driven by what ITOCHU terms ""real demand,"" signaling a market-led approach to the energy transition.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-10-03 06:57:36.868317

Shipping is responsible for nearly 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions, yet remains the most efficient way to move goods internationally.

This puts the industry at a crossroads, where innovation in cleaner logistics solutions is essential to meet the evolving demands of authorities and customers.

DHL Global Forwarding and Hapag-Lloyd have formed a three-year framework agreement with the aim of reducing Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions by using sustainable marine fuels in shipping operations.

The partnership began producing results in July 2025, when the first order under the agreement cut 25,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO₂e) well-to-wake emissions.

This approach considers the entire lifecycle of the fuel, from production to its final use in a ship’s engine.

""We are thrilled to partner with Hapag-Lloyd in driving the adoption of sustainable marine fuels and the book and claim mechanism, ultimately empowering our customers to achieve their climate goals.""

Both companies are committed to ambitious climate goals. DHL aims to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, while Hapag-Lloyd is targeting net-zero emissions across its fleet by 2045.

The book and claim model

A central feature of the DHL and Hapag-Lloyd partnership is the use of the ""book and claim"" model.

This system enables companies to purchase sustainable fuels and claim the associated emission reductions, even if the fuel is not used in their specific shipments.

By separating the environmental benefit from the physical delivery, the model allows more businesses to invest in emission reductions, regardless of their location or access to the actual sustainable fuel.

This approach is especially valuable as advanced biofuels remain scarce and more expensive than traditional marine fuels.

The book and claim model helps broaden access to emission reductions, supporting early action on decarbonisation while supply chains and infrastructure catch up.

""We are delighted to have completed this order with DHL, demonstrating the feasibility and effectiveness of using sustainable marine fuels to reduce Scope 3 emissions through our Ship Green product,"" adds Danny Smolders, Managing Director Global Sales at Hapag-Lloyd.

""Partnering with DHL shows how powerful collaboration can be. Together, we are creating real momentum in further decarbonizing supply chains, one bold step at a time.""

Expanding greener logistics options

Hapag-Lloyd has been using second-generation biofuels since 2020.

In 2023, the company launched its Ship Green product, enabling customers to access lower-emission ocean freight and claim reductions through biofuel blends.

DHL has also expanded its climate-friendly services. Its GoGreen Plus offering is based on the book and claim principle and operates across road, air and sea networks.

This service allows customers to achieve measurable Scope 3 emissions reductions and supports voluntary greenhouse gas reporting and progress tracking towards climate targets.

DHL’s approach focuses on genuine supply chain decarbonisation, prioritising emission cuts within its logistics operations and those of its customers, rather than relying solely on compensation measures.

Both DHL and Hapag-Lloyd aim to shift logistics towards lower-carbon operations through cooperation, innovation and robust reporting.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/10b3fa738f4089191ec314d7cf0b716a:cebdf68dfa637a6b5b39e806863fa869/dhl-and-hlag-decarbonize-supply-chains.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 06:57:42.049911

The call, which was made during a discussion on sustainable shipping at the Caribbean Maritime University Industry Conference on Thursday, comes amid an annoyance from a few of the panellists that cruise lines and foreign shippers collect the profits while Caribbean waters take the hit.

Director of professional services at ECO Canada and former Trinidad and Tobago transport minister Devant Maharaj didn’t mince words.

“Rather than encourage more cruise ships to dump more faecal matter in our seas and more garbage in our seas, we should be charging a blue tax,” he said. “And we take that fund as a Caricom fund, not individual islands. Because if it goes to an individual island, it’ll go to a consolidated fund that will fix a road or a house or a school or something like that. Have a blue tax that Caricom uses to protect our area when necessary.”

Maharaj backed his call with figures.

“On a weekly basis, 795,000 tonnes of raw sewage is dumped in our ocean. Eight tonnes of raw garbage is thrown in our sea. Some 85 per cent of untreated sewage from these cruise liners are released in our ocean,” he told the audience. “Yet still, each island in Caricom courts cruise ships to come to their port.”

The tax proposal fed into a wider debate about the region’s role in global shipping. Logistics strategist Dr Eric Deans reminded participants that the Caribbean Basin accounts for nearly 20 per cent of the world’s shipping tonnage through so-called flags of convenience.

“Even though we’re flags of convenience, we are the sovereign nation for those vessels. So we set the rules regarding how those vessels carry sustainable practices. So I think we need to stop looking at ourselves as being small and insignificant. We control 20 per cent of global shipping,” he said.

Deans warned, however, that the region too often surrenders that leverage by ceding port control to foreign operators.

“When you give away our port to a foreign company … their interest isn’t going to be in making profits for that shipping line. In order to assert our dominance, we have to look at reclaiming our economic assets and operating them in an integrated manner in the industries that they support,” he added.

Others highlighted the weakness of existing frameworks. Radcliffe Spence, lecturer of shipping and logistics at the Caribbean Maritime University, pointed to Jamaica’s Kingston Freeport Terminal concession as an example of missed opportunity.

“Nowhere in that contract was it written about anything about sustainability… They are in there to make profit, and the arrangement is a profit-sharing arrangement,” he said. “Private sector companies, unless they must, will not voluntarily take on [sustainability]. It is something that they will pay less than what is required attention to.”

Spence contrasted that with efforts elsewhere in the region.

“Barbados, their terminal operating equipment are not from biofuel. They are from renewable sources or battery. Antigua expanding its port … they have the capacity to put further solar panels on the port and generate renewable electricity for their port activity,” he noted. Jamaica, by contrast, lags because of “lack of policy”.

However, private companies are beginning to step in where government policies trail.

Valerie Campbell, director of logistics and customer service at Campari Group Jamaica, explained that sustainability is embedded in the company’s procurement rules.

“We do not do business with organisations that have a record or that we are aware of that doesn’t conform with good sustainability or ESG (environmental, social, and governance) practices,” she said. “That is included in our sourcing and procurement strategies … and there is a quarterly evaluation that is done where during the year when we are reviewing how are you performing versus how you indicate that you would perform. Where there are anomalies that are identified, there are clauses that we would have that we treat with those situations.”

As Campari’s J Wray & Nephew operations ship to 44 countries from Jamaica, Campbell said the group’s scale allows it to influence how carriers operate.

Still, for Maharaj, the deeper problem is political fragmentation.

“We act as silos in the Caribbean and don’t unite as one front. We adopt conventions from the IMO (International Maritime Organization), but we don’t give the rest of the world conventions to adopt coming here,” he said.

The International Maritime Organization, the United Nations agency that regulates global shipping, has committed the sector to reach net zero emissions by 2050, with milestones in 2030 and 2040. Caribbean governments have signed on to these conventions but, as several speakers argued, lag in implementation and fail to use their collective influence to shape the agenda.

Maharaj pressed for a wider definition of sustainability beyond environmental measures.

“When most people think about sustainability, they focus on the environmental side, but sustainability is three parts. Environmental, social and economic. When we become economically self-sufficient, when we break the shackles of colonialism … that is when we will truly be sustainable,” he said.",https://www.jamaicaobserver.com/jamaicaobserver/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/10/jo-2025-10-03T024709.160.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 06:57:46.130097

“We think the Middle East with its tanker volume is a really interesting place for us and I think that they're really focused on ways to reduce their carbon footprint as well, we think that would be a compelling story for the Middle East as well,” explained Walker.

STAX was officially launched last year by co-founders Bob Sharp (CTO), Mike Walker (CEO) and Chief Strategy Officer Edward Norton to fill, what the company believes is a gap in the market where costly shore power remains unavailable and pollutant restrictions constrain emissions.

Walker views shore power as, “Super elegant, but we see a lot of the same pattern recognition in Europe and the UK, and frankly the rest of the world that California have, which is you can make a lot of headway real quick with shore power and then it grinds to a halt because infrastructure issues, grid issues deployment issues and what have you.”

Moreover, Walker points out that that “The vast majority of vessels don't have shore power capabilities,” leaving STAX with a “tremendous opportunity” to reduce the emissions from ships at berth.

“You know, 44,000 cars worth of emissions go off on these vessels every day, and there's a solution to capture that, and there's a solution to address what is this gap that we talked about,” added Walker.

The STAX system simply attaches a pipe to a vessel’s exhaust stack at berth to collects and process the emissions in an adjacent barge, that are discharged for permanent storage or use in other, clean, processes.

At launch STAX began with two barges in California and has now expanded to eight emissions collection vessels with the expectation to increase to 30 barges over the next 18 months to meet the expansion of Californian regulations.

“We're looking at what's happening with the rest of the United States from a pollution perspective as well, and so that's another doubling of the fleet, probably to 60 or 70 barges,” explained Walker.

In addition, the company is in talks with the UK ports of Southampton and Harwich and there are ongoing discussions with ports in Europe to add the system.

The CEO explained that STAX began by capturing particulate matter (PM) and NOx, because Californian regulations looked “at what would kill you first before what will kill you later,” considering carbon a less immediate pollutant.

Greenhouse gas emissions including carbon and methane are now far more in focus, and the company is driving the clean up of port vicinities.

“The onus is really on how do we match that business plan so that we can drive carbon capture to a price point that makes sense?

Green finance has not yet solved this gap, the paper warns, and financial incentives remain weak.","Research by Bayes Business School is charting a route towards a more sustainable shipping industry.

Dr Ioannis Moutzouris, Onassis Associate Professor of Shipping Finance and Sustainability at the School’s Costas Grammenos Centre for Shipping, Trade and Finance, presented a white paper around work he and colleagues are undertaking at the Bayes Annual Research Day last month. The project is an example of one of the four core research themes at Bayes: tackling societal challenges.

The challenge around sustainable shipping draws together academics, research students and practitioners with expertise spanning shipping economics and finance, energy/commodity economics and finance, actuarial and data science, insurance, management, banking – and food policy. The food experts are from City St George’s School of Health and Medical Sciences, and their involvement is an example of the multidisciplinary research fostered by the recent merger of City and St George’s.

Dr Moutzouris’s white paper highlights the scale of the technological, financial and regulatory barriers the sector must navigate to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. The shipping industry currently produces around 2-3 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG).

A national effort

The work highlighted in the white paper is part-funded by the UK National Clean Maritime Research Hub – a consortium of 14 British universities funded by the Government and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), with matching funding from the universities and partners. Dr Moutzouris is a co-Investigator, leading the hub’s “Advances in maritime operations, exploitation of digitalisation and green finance” theme.

The maritime industry faces mounting international and regional pressure to cut emissions. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) initially sought to reduce emissions from ships by 40 per cent by 2030. However, two years ago it set a more ambitious goal of “reaching net zero by or around 2050”. The EU has gone further with the implementation of the FuelEU Maritime Regulation and the continued phase-in of the Emissions Trading System (ETS). The UK ETS will include domestic maritime emissions from 1 July 2026.

In April the IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee approved the organisation’s Net-zero Framework, which is “the first in the world to combine mandatory emissions limits and GHG pricing across an entire industry sector”. If formally adopted in October, these measures will come into force in 2027.

Squalls hit fuels transition

While shipping is relatively sustainable compared with other forms of transport, its sheer scale makes change difficult. The white paper notes that the industry must shift from fossil fuels to cleaner technologies and fuels – such as green methanol, green hydrogen and green ammonia. Yet these fuels remain costly, scarce and uncertain in terms of long-term viability.

In the short term, owners and operators can reduce their carbon footprint through:

Operational changes, notably slower sailing speeds

Vessel design improvements and energy-saving technologies

Use of transitional fuels like liquid natural gas (LNG), which is less polluting than oil but still fossil-based

Partial reliance on renewable propulsion, such as wind-assist systems.

Deeper GHG emissions reduction, however, demands expensive new vessels capable of running on zero or near zero-carbon fuels, Dr Moutzouris says – but that brings financial challenges.

The paper highlights a “trilemma” for shipowners: invest in cheaper polluting vessels, pay more for greener ships or delay investment altogether. Freight rate volatility has always influenced shipping investment, but now technological uncertainty makes decision-making even harder. Since 2018, the historical correlation between the price shipping companies can charge for transporting freight and new ship orders has fallen sharply, reflecting investor anxiety.

A dual-fuel container ship that can burn LNG costs 12-28 per cent more than its conventional equivalent, while the gap for methanol dual-fuel vessels is between 9-20 per cent. Investors, however, are not yet seeing a proportionately higher return on these higher upfront costs.

Green finance has not yet solved this gap, the paper warns, and financial incentives remain weak. The difference in loan costs between standard and green loans is just 0.23 per cent – a margin Dr Moutzouris says is simply too small to offset major additional capital expenditure.

Meanwhile, the white paper has revealed another pressing issue that has loomed into view: the ageing global fleet. Some 36 per cent of ships are over 15 years old, with only moderate levels of orders for new vessels. If demand for new ships remains becalmed, both environmental risks and disruption to global trade capacity could rise.

The white paper concludes that without stronger economic and regulatory incentives, shipping companies are unlikely to commit fully to decarbonisation.

As the authors put it: “For profit-maximising shipping companies to invest in greener vessels and technologies, there needs to be clear economic and financial incentives.”

Dr Moutzouris addressed these issues in a panel discussion about decarbonising the industry during the recent London International Shipping Week.

Uncertainty over emerging fuels and related technologies and a string of geopolitical shocks means the sector will struggle to meet targets, he warned.

“While there has been progress compared to a few years ago, at the current pace of green technology adoption, it does not seem feasible to reach the revised IMO targets and to align with the Paris climate commitments. Fuel producers and those who own and operate ships need more certainty around cash flow and green incentives if they are to step up investment.”

The UK National Clean Maritime Research Hub is intended to accelerate the decarbonisation and elimination of air pollution from maritime activity in ports and at sea. As well as environmental impacts, the hub focuses on the potential economic and social benefits of transitioning to a clean maritime future.

Global ripples

In the face of the upcoming International Maritime Organization. (IMO) Net-Zero Framework vote next month, we’re seeing a lot of rhetoric around the so-called LNG pathway, yet little substance.

Recent commentary from IMO leadership and key industry players, including classification societies, has ignited a specious debate about the role of LNG as a “transition” fuel. Commercial interests from DNV and ABS – the latter running its own LNG Academy – are blatantly clear as they attempt to use their industry influence to sell LNG as a viable pathway.

But let us be clear with you, LNG, in any shape or form, cannot be a solution for shipping. The IMO must recognise this in the guidelines that still need to be negotiated over the coming months, and that will shape the framework before it enters into action in 2027.

The reason why is simple: methane.

The reality is that methane emissions from ships fuelled by LNG increased 180% between 2016 and 2023. Research repeatedly shows that methane – a potent greenhouse gas – is incompatible with the shipping sector’s decarbonisation goals. Regardless of the source of LNG (fossil, bio-LNG, e-LNG), methane still leaks through the entire lifecycle of this fuel – from extraction and processing to storage and use at sea. Industry continues to tout “innovative” technological solutions that will address methane slip with poor science underpinning these claims.

The cost advantage reinforced by the industry’s short-term cost optimisation strategies is expected to sustain the increase of LNG-fuelled ships unless governments step in with clear policies to counter this trend. Despite robust demand projections, the LNG market is grappling with structural challenges. It is reasonable to expect that not all newbuilding contracts will be completed, and instead, see the pivot away from LNG to electrification continue to take place. Shipowners will inevitably confront either costly retrofits, with the latest available research estimating £113bn ($152m) to £185bn in losses investing in an LNG-capable fleet, or the early recycling of LNG-powered vessels – both carrying significant financial and environmental burdens. What may seem like a short-term economic strategy risks leaving the sector with a costly legacy of prematurely obsolete ships.

The path is clear: there is no space in the IMO Net-Zero Framework for LNG. What we need instead has been clearly articulated by the Marshall Islands, Mexico, Palau, Solomon Islands, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu, and the civil society at the IMO.

First, the IMO must align shipping’s climate ambition with the 1.5 degree climate-warming pathway and the principles of a just and equitable transition.

Secondly, governments must ensure alignment and coherence among all three policy elements that are critical to make the IMO strategy work: a carbon intensity measure, a global fuel standard, and a GHG pricing system. These must be guided by life cycle assessment (LCA) guidelines based on the well-to-wake principle.

Finally, the correspondence group on ‘other social and economic sustainability aspects of marine fuels’ within the LCA guidelines must be re-established to send a strong signal that the IMO is serious about applying the well-to-wake principle across its GHG framework.

Special attention must also be paid to the land rights of Indigenous and rural communities, as well as the risks to biodiversity, water, and food security that come with land-use change. Embedding these human rights and ecosystem perspectives in the LCA guidelines would ensure that assessments of new marine fuels put people and nature at the centre.

Once the IMO applies this comprehensive life-cycle approach under the framework’s guidelines, it becomes clear that methane-based fuels – LNG, biomethane, and e-methane – cannot credibly deliver on climate, pollution, or human rights objectives, exposing the industry’s rhetoric for what it is: false promises that have propped up LNG all along.",https://splash247.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Say-no-to-LNG.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 06:58:30.230502

• Fuels: Optimization and electrification of the airport's vehicle fleet.

• Air conditioning: Replacement of equipment, improved management, and prevention of refrigerant fluid leaks.

The net zero emissions target for 2026 was achieved one year ahead of schedule.

Lyon Airport is committed to maintaining this reduction over time by keeping its emissions below 500 tonnes of CO2 equivalent per year and offsetting residual emissions through local reforestation projects certified under the Low Carbon Label. These projects, launched in 2021 and 2022 in partnership with the Rhône Department and the National Forestry Office (Office National des Forêts), are located in the northern Beaujolais region in France.

The ACA5 certification not only recognizes the efforts made to reduce Lyon-Saint Exupéry airport's direct emissions but also highlights the work accomplished in supporting all its stakeholders in decarbonizing their activities (Scope 3).

This commitment is reflected in several key initiatives:

• Development of photovoltaic plants: By 2025, 25 MWp will be operational, including 20 MWp injected into the grid to supply neighboring communities, avoiding nearly 1,600 tonnes of CO2 emissions annually, and 5 MWp dedicated to self-consumption.

• Construction of hydrogen distribution stations: The first station, Hympulsion, designed for light vehicles, was inaugurated last June in collaboration with the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes Region.

• Electrification of ground vehicle fleets: Installation of electric vehicle charging stations in airport parking lots, with 850 chargers to be operational by 2026.

• Landing fee modulation: Incentivizing the use of lower-emission aircraft.

• Distribution of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF): Starting in 2025, in compliance with the ReFuel EU regulation.

• Local production and supply of synthetic sustainable aviation fuels,thanks to the signing of a partnership with H2V and Hy2gen in early 2025.

He explained how these systems reduce fuel consumption and engine wear, seamlessly integrate with existing fleets, and have been independently verified for efficiency and cost-effectiveness. He urged shipowners to adopt such practical measures now to meet IMO decarbonisation targets.

Building on this, Eirik Nyhus provided a regulatory perspective, focusing on the IMO’s strengthened GHG Strategy and the forthcoming Net-Zero Framework. He outlined the significant regulatory shifts on the horizon, including mandatory fuel intensity reductions, a two-tier pricing system, and amendments to MARPOL Annex VI that will soon enter into force. Nyhus stressed that while the 2050 net-zero ambition is clear, the interim 2030 and 2040 milestones will be particularly demanding, requiring coordinated global action, new compliance frameworks, and substantial technological advancement.

Dr Ahmed Al Abri shifted the focus towards shipbuilding and repair, highlighting the crucial role of regional yards in enabling decarbonisation. He emphasised how ship repair facilities like ASRY are investing in new infrastructure and expertise to retrofit vessels with energy-efficient technologies, extend asset life cycles, and support owners in meeting regulatory obligations. He argued that collaboration between shipowners, yards, and technology providers will be key to achieving emission reduction goals without disrupting trade flows.

Adding a supply chain dimension, Peter Marvin discussed the importance of integrated logistics solutions in the decarbonisation journey. He explained how operational efficiency, digitalisation, and strategic asset management can reduce bottlenecks, lower fuel use, and create more resilient and environmentally sustainable supply chains. Marvin stressed that efficiency gains on land and sea together deliver greater decarbonisation impact than isolated initiatives.

Omar Alsebeyi brought in the perspective of rail, highlighting the transformative role Etihad Rail Freight is playing in diversifying transport and reducing emissions. He explained how shifting freight from road to rail can dramatically cut carbon intensity while offering reliable, cost-effective alternatives for shippers. Alsebeyi underscored the potential for rail to serve as the backbone of a low-carbon logistics network, complementing decarbonisation initiatives in shipping and ports.

On the financial side, Hemant Nandanpawar emphasised the importance of climate finance mechanisms in making decarbonisation economically viable. He detailed how frameworks such as carbon credits and green financing instruments can incentivise investment in clean technologies, bridge funding gaps, and support companies transitioning to low-carbon operations. He stressed the importance of robust governance and transparency to ensure credibility and impact in carbon markets.

Tony Dagher addressed the practical challenges shipowners face in implementing decarbonisation measures. Drawing from his experience at TMC Shipping, he pointed to rising costs, fragmented regulations, and uncertainty over future fuels as key concerns. However, he also highlighted the opportunities for early adopters to gain competitive advantage by embracing innovative technologies, collaborating with classification societies, and exploring partnerships that reduce risk.

Fadi Al-Shihabi focused on the role of advisory and consultancy support in guiding businesses through the energy transition. He outlined KPMG’s sustainability frameworks for measuring carbon footprints, developing decarbonisation roadmaps, and embedding ESG principles into core strategy. He argued that companies that align financial, environmental, and social metrics will be best positioned to attract investment and remain competitive in a low-carbon economy.

Rounding off the session, Margabandhu Kumaraswamy highlighted the role of classification societies such as Bureau Veritas in accelerating the adoption of innovative technologies. He described how rigorous testing, validation, and certification provide confidence for shipowners to invest in alternative fuels and advanced vessel designs. Kumaraswamy also noted the importance of regional collaboration in scaling up innovation across the Middle East and Africa.

The session concluded with an engaging panel discussion and interactive Q&A, which reinforced the message that while decarbonisation is one of the greatest challenges in the history of shipping, it also presents a unique opportunity. Through the combined efforts of regulators, shipowners, ports, financiers, classification societies, and technology providers, a credible and practical pathway to net zero is beginning to take shape.

Session Two, themed “Innovations & Technology for Decarbonized Mobility,” explored forward-looking strategies to advance sustainable transportation. Chaired by Ali Shehab, Global Director, Special Projects & Services, DNV Maritime, the session brought insights from Dr Abdullah Sulaiman Al-Abri, VP Sustainability, SOHAR Port and Freezone; Imran S. Inamdar, Chief Operating Officer, Drydocks World; Theo Xenakoudis, Chief Commercial Officer and Managing Director, Piraeus office, International Registries Inc; Abdul Fahl, Director, TTMS (Gulf); Katherine Yakunchenkova, General Manager, Al Safina Security; Dr. Alejandro Rios-Galvan, Independent Sustainability Consultant; and Kamran Ul Haq, Global Senior Vice President, Lloyd’s Register. Presentations covered a range of practical solutions including ship retrofitting, digital optimisation, alternative fuels such as biofuels and hydrogen, and enhanced safety systems.

Dr Abdullah Sulaiman Al-Abri opened the session with a presentation on “Making Decarbonisation Bankable: A Testbed for the Low Carbon Economy.” He outlined the long-term vision of SOHAR Port and Freezone to become a fully integrated hub where industrial clusters in metals, food, and plastics operate in harmony with sustainability goals. Al-Abri underscored the importance of digitalisation in optimising port and terminal operations to cut fuel use and reduce emissions, as well as the role of public-private partnerships in creating resilient, sustainable growth. He positioned ports as living laboratories where innovation, regulation, and investment intersect to accelerate decarbonisation.

Imran S. Inamdar focused on the role of shipyards in delivering practical decarbonisation solutions. He detailed how Drydocks World is enabling the industry to meet IMO 2030 and 2050 goals through retrofits, conversions, and energy-efficiency upgrades. These include next-generation energy-saving devices, air lubrication systems, advanced hull coatings, and propeller modifications based on computational fluid dynamics. He emphasised that shipyards are not only supporting fleet compliance but are also becoming central actors in the shift toward offshore clean energy and zero-carbon infrastructure.

Theo Xenakoudis provided insights on the role of flag registries in supporting sustainable shipping. He explained that registries such as the Republic of the Marshall Islands ensure compliance with critical IMO conventions including SOLAS, MARPOL, the Ballast Water Management Convention, and the Hong Kong Convention on ship recycling. Beyond compliance, Xenakoudis stressed that forward-looking registries can help accelerate adoption of new technologies by offering guidance, incentives, and proactive participation in IMO working groups. He pointed to the need for strong compliance cultures that reduce risk, attract green investment, and support long-term decarbonisation goals.

Abdul Fahl brought an insurance perspective, speaking on “Ports at Risk: Climate Change Through the Lens of Insurance.” He outlined how climate change is reshaping the risk profile of ports, with increased tidal surges, microbursts, and unprecedented rainfall events threatening operations. He emphasised the need for comprehensive risk assessments and continuity planning to protect not only infrastructure and equipment but also customers’ property. Advances in meteorology and predictive technology, he noted, can help operators anticipate and mitigate risks more effectively, ensuring resilience in an era of climate uncertainty.

Katherine Yakunchenkova addressed the intersection of maritime security and sustainability, presenting on “Smart, Secure and Sustainable Seas.” She explained how Al Safina Security is leveraging smart maritime intelligence platforms to enhance situational awareness, reduce risks, and improve decision-making. Yakunchenkova noted that security and environmental performance are no longer separate issues; rather, they are interconnected priorities requiring integrated solutions that balance compliance, carbon costs, and operational efficiency.

Dr Alejandro Rios-Galvan drew on his experience as former Chief Research Scientist at Khalifa University to highlight lessons from the Seawater Energy and Agriculture System (SEAS), an innovative bioenergy project piloted in Masdar City. He described how the system integrated food, water, biomass, and ecosystem services into a closed-loop model that delivered strong results for over eight years. Though the pilot was decommissioned in 2024, he argued that the knowledge gained demonstrates the potential of holistic, systems-based approaches in advancing sustainable energy and agriculture solutions linked to transport decarbonisation.

Kamran Ul Haq concluded the session with a perspective on green ports and terminals. He emphasised the need for resilience, electrification, and the adoption of clean energy in port operations to create zero-emission ecosystems. Haq underlined that ports and terminals, as gateways of global trade, must transition rapidly to low-carbon operations if the maritime sector is to meet its climate obligations. He also called for stronger collaboration between regulators, operators, and technology providers to standardise and scale the adoption of green infrastructure worldwide.

The session ended with an interactive Q&A and a panel discussion, reinforcing the importance of cross-sector innovation and information sharing.

According to DNV's statistics, only 14 alternative-fueled ships were ordered in September, and none at all in August.

""Following a record-breaking first half of the year, zero new orders in August and relatively low activity in September signal a clear slowdown in the alternative-fueled market in the third quarter,"" said Jason Stefanatos, Global Decarbonization Director at DNV Maritime.

The newbuild market as a whole is weaker than it was early in the year, and costs are rising, he said. But decisions about new alternative-fueled ships are also being put off because of the uncertainty surrounding emissions regulation at IMO. The tentative deal agreed in April 2025 was approved by a strong majority of member states, but support was far from a unanimous. The agreement's critics - led in part by the United States, which has changed tack on climate policy since the beginning of the Trump administration - are pressing for changes, or even a pause on implementation for a rethink of the terms.

Given the renewed uncertainty over the future direction of the regulatory environment, it may be no surprise that owners are holding back until after the next IMO MEPC meeting in October. Of those few who are still buying dual-fuel ships in the interim, the majority are ordering LNG-fueled propulsion, DNV's numbers show.

Our Oceans

Generating half of the planet’s oxygen, absorbing around 30% of carbon dioxide emissions, holding nearly 97% of Earth’s water and home to some of the most diverse ecosystems on the planet, the oceans are critical to our survival. Some call them the true lungs of our world.

Oceans connect us all and impact many, if not every, aspect of our lives. They regulate temperature, provide food, energy, and livelihoods to billions of people, and carry around 80% of global trade. They are an important sink for greenhouse gases, and they provide us with water and the oxygen we breathe.

The United Nations regards the oceans as our greatest ally in keeping global warming well below two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, as anticipated in the Paris Agreement.

Yet, these vital ecosystems are also over-exploited as a food source, the end point for much of the pollution generated by humans, the subject of irreversible biodiversity loss and a signifier for the consequences of climate change.

As the largest industry operating across the world’s oceans, a duty of care exists, and we must therefore continue to work together to protect the marine environment and prevent further damage where possible.

“The shipping industry is well placed to lead progress in environmental protection, and by embracing inclusivity, it can demonstrate how diverse talent, and perspectives can drive meaningful change,” says WISTA International President, Elpi Petraki.

Our Obligation

The maritime industry is accustomed to adapting to new regulations, and in recent years resolve has strengthened at the International Maritime Organization (IMO’s) to protect the marine environment.

Speaking ahead of World Maritime Day, Arsenio Dominguez, Secretary General of the IMO, said: “Our oceans are struggling to keep up with human pressure. The ocean’s decline isn't a coincidence; it's driven by human activities. But that also means that we have the power to reverse it. It is our obligation to work collaboratively to reduce pollution, protect marine life, and shift to sustainable habits.”

A robust regulatory framework has been established to safeguard the marine environment from the impacts of shipping. Recent years have seen the introduction of major new instruments – to limit air pollution, ban harmful hull coatings, address the damage done by invasive species in ballast water, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions from ships.

During the upcoming IMO Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) Extraordinary Session, formal adoption of the IMO Net-Zero Framework is also expected, in a decisive step towards achieving IMO’s decarbonization ambitions for shipping.

Our Opportunity

However, the regulatory push is only one piece of the puzzle, says Petraki. The pull of leadership is also required – to show what is possible, to create models for others to emulate, and to encourage and inspire.

“That is why achieving environmental sustainability will also need a deeper cultural change – and I firmly believe it must be one that values diversity, challenges norms and champions inclusive leadership,” says Petraki.

“It is not a coincidence that United Nations goals for Sustainable Development, which in Goal 14 urge us to conserve the oceans, seas and marine resources, also aim to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls as their fifth goal,” she adds.

Added as annex to resolutions by the UN Conference on Sustainable Development in 2012, ‘The Future We Want’ reaffirms “the need to achieve economic stability, sustained economic growth, promotion of social equity and protection of the environment, while enhancing gender equality, women's empowerment and equal opportunities for all”.

Diversity and inclusion widen the range of perspectives, Petraki notes. “Seeking more views – from women, the younger generation and under-represented groups – creates new opportunities for innovation,” she says.

In the case of the marine environment, it is critical that coastal and island nations are represented in global decision-making when ocean degradation is at stake – not least because local knowledge is likely to be invaluable. In addition, people are more likely to engage with sustainable goals if they are involved in the process.

The shipping industry is already taking concrete steps to support global decarbonization, working collaboratively across borders and sectors to accelerate progress. As part of its own commitment to the environment, WISTA International established an Environmental Committee, bringing together environmental experts from across its 62 National WISTA Associations (NWAs) in response to the deepening climate crisis.

“Inclusion paves the way for innovation and better outcomes – for people, the industry and the planet – and World Maritime Day reminds us that together, we can all make a real difference to the world we live in,” adds Petraki.",https://maritime-executive.com/media/images/article/Elpi-Petraki-new-pic-red.7936eb.jpg,N,,2025-10-02 07:22:34.250421

“The marine transportation industry is responsible for a percentage of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and the volume of cargo shipped is expected to increase as the global economy expands,” it stated.

“The reduction of the use of carbon-emitting marine fuels is an urgent issue. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has created a strategy for reducing GHG emissions, and it has been working to achieve net-zero GHG emissions from international shipping by around 2050.

“The Japanese government also encourages the introduction of alternative fuels with the goals of reducing GHG emissions by 46% versus the fiscal 2013 level by 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality by 2050.”

According to ITOCHU, the low-carbon methanol fuel recently supplied is made from biomass-derived raw materials, and it is expected that the GHG emissions throughout the life cycle of the fuel will be less than that of conventional fuels.

Methanol fuel is in a liquid state at normal atmospheric temperatures and pressures, which makes using existing infrastructure relatively easy. The popularity of methanol fuel is expected to increase in the future together with the popularity of dual-fuel carriers.

ITOCHU will use this opportunity to accelerate the development of a supply chain for low-carbon alternative fuels in the marine transportation sector and the energy transition whose roots are in the real demand that exists for it.

COSCO Shipping Heavy Industry (Shanghai) (CHI Shanghai) has successfully completed China’s first ship-to-ship methanol bunkering operation by a shipbuilding and repair enterprise at a shipyard’s berth, marking a major milestone in the nation’s adoption of alternative marine fuels, stated Bureau Veritas Solutions Marine & Offshore (BVS) on Wednesday (1 October).

The operation took place at CHI Shanghai’s shipyard terminal, where the COSCO Shipping Libra safely bunkered 2,100 metric tonnes (mt) of methanol fuel within 10 hours. BVS, a technical advisory arm of Bureau Veritas Marine & Offshore (BV), provided expert risk assessment and technical support, ensuring the safe and efficient execution of the project.

The successful bunkering provides a replicable model for future methanol dual-fuel conversions and supply projects while showcasing CHI Shanghai’s ability to deliver end-to-end solutions across repair, conversion, and bunkering. This capability further accelerates the shift from conventional fuels to greener alternatives.

In preparation for the operation, CHI Shanghai worked closely with multiple stakeholders. Technical reviews were held to verify the feasibility, safety, and compliance for bunkering 20,000 TEU dual-fuel container ships. The shipyard also organised methanol-specific training programs, tabletop emergency exercises, and safety management initiatives to ensure robust risk controls were applied across the process and surrounding environment.

Throughout the project, BVS provided support by conducting comprehensive HAZID (Hazard Identification) and HAZOP (Hazard and Operability Study) risk assessments across five key stages: truck-to-ship inerting, bunkering vessel berthing, ship-to-ship transfer, post-bunkering purging, and vessel departure. These measures established a strong and reliable safety framework for the operation.

“By working closely with COSCO Shipping Heavy Industry (Shanghai), we have shown how collaboration, preparation, and rigorous risk management can make methanol bunkering both safe and practical,” said Matthieu de Tugny, Executive Vice President, Industrials and Commodities, Bureau Veritas.

“This operation sets a new benchmark for China’s alternative fuel adoption, and Bureau Veritas is committed to supporting the industry as it accelerates its transition to cleaner energy.”

Latest data from classification society DNV’s Alternative Fuels Insight (AFI) platform showed liquified natural gas (LNG) fuelled newbuildings forming most alternative-fuelled orders in September 2025.

A total of 14 orders for alternative-fuelled vessels were placed in September 2025, according to the latest data from DNV’s AFI platform.

Of these orders, 12 were for LNG-fuelled vessels, with six of these coming from the container segment, four from the bulk carrier segment, and two from the cruise segment. The remaining two orders were for LPG carriers.

Overall, 192 new orders for alternative-fuelled vessels have been placed in the first nine months of 2025, representing a decline of 48% compared to the same period in 2024. LNG-fuelled vessels accounted for the majority of these orders (121), followed by 43 orders for methanol-fuelled ships, with the remainder made up by LPG carriers (19), ammonia-fuelled vessels (5), and hydrogen-fuelled vessels (4).

New ordering in the alternative-fuelled market continues to be dominated by the container segment, which has accounted for 63% of all new orders so far in 2025 (120 vessels).

Jason Stefanatos, Global Decarbonization Director at DNV Maritime, commented:

“Following a record-breaking first half of the year, zero new orders in August and relatively low activity in September signal a clear slowdown in the alternative-fuelled market in the third quarter.

“While this trend reflects a weaker overall newbuild market and rising contracting costs, other factors are also influencing sentiment.

“Uncertainties around the IMO’s Net-Zero Framework, including lifecycle assessment factors for certain fuels, are prompting many owners to adopt a ‘wait and see’ approach to new orders. It is, therefore, essential that the industry receives greater regulatory clarity in the coming months.”

Now that we have all the AI centres, information centres that are built, they need significant energy,” said Marinakis.
Beyond the demand benefits of AI, Marinakis said the technology holds great potential to improve operational efficiency.
In a time of geopolitical tension, increasing tariffs and conflict in Ukraine and in Palestine, Marinakis said efficiency is key to riding out volatile markets.
“What is very important nowadays, with all that is going on and with the uncertainty, is for shipping to be efficient.","Tanker owners with modern, efficient tonnage will reap the rewards of increased energy demand from the boom in AI data centres, eventually compounded by the disappearance of the shadow fleet, according to Evangelos Marinakis, Founder and Chairman at Capital Maritime Trading Corp.

Marinakis said the supply demand balance was supported by a limited orderbook through 2028 for VLCCs and Suezmaxes, and a significant delay in scrapping the older fleet and sanctioned fleet.

“I think that it is a matter of time until this fleet needs to be scrapped. Of course, if this happens, we will see that there will be a shortage of tonnage, because demand is increasing and energy is needed all around the world. Now that we have all the AI centres, information centres that are built, they need significant energy,” said Marinakis.

“In my opinion, when all these ghost vessels, shadow vessels disappear, there will be a shortage of tonnage. And I think that the owners and the people that have invested in building the new ships, they will realise a huge benefit,” he added.

Beyond the demand benefits of AI, Marinakis said the technology holds great potential to improve operational efficiency. “[For] all these years, we have gathered information in shipping that hasn't been really used. Now with AI, there is plenty of data that can be provided, that can show us fantastic results in efficiency, in [fuel] consumptions in the ship’s operation.”

Marinakis was speaking at the Saudi Maritime & Logistics Congress in Dammam, Saudi Arabia, alongside Bahri Oil President Hisham Alnughaimish, who agreed on the potential of AI and stressed the ongoing role of the human in shipping.

“Automation is a supplement, not a replacement for expertise. In our shipping sectors, you have to have human intelligence. This is for sure… automation will make things fast, make more accurate forecasts and help as a supplement. It is important to have both in parallel, together,” said Alnughaimish.

Bahri and Capital Maritime are no strangers to each other, the Saudi owner splashed $1 billion on nine VLCCs from the Marinakis led-company last year.

In a time of geopolitical tension, increasing tariffs and conflict in Ukraine and in Palestine, Marinakis said efficiency is key to riding out volatile markets. “What is very important nowadays, with all that is going on and with the uncertainty, is for shipping to be efficient. And efficiency for us in shipping is a new very strong currency. We need to have efficient fleets to serve our country's needs and be there, have the flexibility and be able to repeat business with our clients.”

Marinakis proposed that the saying “oil never lets you down” be amended to “oil and gas never lets you down,” as the world needs both together, and investment levels are strong in both.

Capital Maritime has invested heavily in dual-fuel LNG vessels across shipping sectors, as well as LNG carriers, and Marinakis expects the strategy to pay off over the coming decade. “I think that for the next 10 years, LNG will play a significant role. Also, when this dispute [the war in Ukraine] will be over and we have clarity of what is going on, I think that LNG prices will go down. They will be competitive, and there will be a significant saving from the bunker itself.”",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltdcfe6aab5515629e/blt701228056ceffe86/68de0a2e055d23bd2b56d71b/Marinakis-_Alnughaimish-credit-Informa-Markets.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-10-02 07:22:48.029810

It is, therefore, essential that the industry receives greater regulatory clarity in the coming months.”

This current slowdown contrasts sharply with the first half of 2025, which saw orders for alternative-fuelled ships reach 19.8 million gross tonnes (GT), a 78% increase compared to the same period in 2024. While the total number of vessels ordered (151) was slightly lower than the 179 ordered in H1 2024, the substantial increase in gross tonnage revealed a focus on larger vessels adopting cleaner fuel technologies.

The maritime industry now faces additional uncertainty with a pivotal vote at the International Maritime Organization (IMO) this month. The IMO’s Net Zero Framework, if adopted, would be the first global regime to pair mandatory emissions caps with greenhouse gas pricing across the entire industry. The plan, set to take effect in 2027, would introduce steep penalties for ships that miss fuel-efficiency targets.",https://gcaptain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/shutterstock_142906477.jpg,N,,2025-10-02 07:22:51.529575

(Anemoi) are pleased to announce the successful completion of the Rotor Sail installation on U-Ming’s Grand Pioneer, a 325,000 DWT Very Large Ore Carrier (VLOC).

U-Ming is the first Taiwanese shipowner to adopt Rotor Sails, marking a major milestone in the company’s decarbonisation strategy and underlining its role as a first mover in deploying innovative clean technologies.

The four 35m tall, 5m diameter folding (tilting) Rotor Sails were delivered fully assembled and dynamically balanced from Anemoi’s production base on the Yangtze River and transported by barge to COSCO Zhoushan shipyard. In a streamlined plug-and-play process unique to Anemoi, the sails were lifted directly onto the deck and secured in place. This method significantly reduces the shipyard’s scope of work and keeps installation time short. For this installation, it took only 1.5 days to lift and fix the Rotor Sails in position onboard, with a further 5 days for commissioning and testing all four Rotor Sails and folding systems once the shipyard had completed their works during the vessel’s scheduled dry-dock in September 2025.

Anemoi’s specialist team were present throughout the process overseeing the installation and will sail on the vessel’s maiden voyage from Zhoushan to Singapore, with the Rotor Sails deployed and operational. This is to ensure crew training and operational handover will be completed smoothly, equipping U-Ming’s seafarers with the skills and confidence to operate the technology from day one.

Jeff Hsu, Vice Chairman of U-Ming added, “The installation of Rotor Sails on Grand Pioneer marks an important step in U-Ming’s decarbonisation journey and reflects our belief that the future of global shipping must be both sustainable and competitive. Through the collaboration with our forward-thinking partner Anemoi, we are turning strategy into action by reducing emissions, enhancing efficiency, and delivering long-term value. This initiative also demonstrates our commitment to innovation and our contribution to the industry’s shared ambition of achieving net zero by 2050.”

Clare Urmston, CEO of Anemoi, commented, “We are proud to have delivered another successful Rotor Sail installation, providing fully assembled technology that minimises time in the yard and maximises value for our customers. U-Ming’s decision to adopt Rotor Sails, particularly as the first in the Taiwanese market to do so, demonstrates their strength, ambition and clear focus on decarbonisation. Our collaboration reflects the growing momentum behind wind propulsion as a critical pathway to lower emission shipping, and we look forward to analysing the performance data from upcoming voyages.”

Following completion of the installation, Grand Pioneer will resume deep-sea service between Brazil and China under a long-term charter with Brazilian mining company Vale. The vessel is projected to achieve annual fuel and emissions reductions of approximately 10–12% on average.

This milestone underscores the importance of industry collaboration in driving meaningful change. By taking decisive action as a first mover, U-Ming is reinforcing its decarbonisation strategy while setting an important example for the global shipping community, demonstrating how innovative partnerships and proven technologies like Rotor Sails can accelerate the sector’s transition towards a net-zero future.",https://www.ajot.com/images/uploads/article/_large/grand-pioneer01_enlarged_2mb.jpg,N,,2025-10-02 07:23:08.451355

China holds an opposing stance to the US regarding new international bunker rules that could be adopted by the International Maritime Organization next month.

Among the five revisions unveiled by the State Council, a new clause empowers Beijing to take countermeasures if foreign countries impose discriminatory restrictions on Chinese shipping, shipowners or seafarers.

The countermeasures include, but are not limited to, imposing special fees on vessels from the offending country calling at Chinese ports, restricting or banning those ships from entering Chinese ports, blocking access to Chinese maritime data and information, and limiting business opportunities in the country’s maritime logistics sector.

Trade tensions

The USTR will initially impose extra fees on Chinese ships, ranging from $18 to $50 per net ton, as Washington seeks to counter what it describes as China’s maritime dominance amid ongoing trade tensions between the two countries.

The fees, announced in February prior to several revisions, have begun to deter Chinese ships from US ports and have caused trade disruptions, as affected parties seek to safeguard their profitability.

According to S&P Global Commodity Insights data, in 2024, Chinese-built tankers transported 22% of US crude oil exports and imports and 19% of refined products, while the country’s total international oil flows reached 12.3 million b/d.

State-backed Cosco Shipping Holdings, China’s top container shipping group, could need to pay $1.5 billion to the US in 2026, according to estimates by HSBC.

A three-year project funded by Japan to train instructors from Asian countries in operating LNG-fuelled ships;

A partnership with the World Maritime University to produce training materials for seafarers on alternative fuels, which also contributed to the Maritime Just Transition Task Force training frameworks, launched in September;

Support for trainers in developing countries to produce locally relevant courses along with online learning modules through the GreenVoyage2050 Programme;

Captain Saif Al Mheiri, chief executive of Abu Dhabi Maritime and chief sustainability officer at Abu Dhabi Ports, said companies in the Emirates were taking extensive measures to reduce their carbon footprint.

He was speaking at the first World Maritime Day parallel event held in the UAE, at which global experts and regulators discussed how international shipping can meet net-zero greenhouse gas emission targets by 2050.

“It is our obligation to be sustainable through a number of factors,” Capt Al Mheiri said at the event staged as a follow-up to World Maritime Day, which took place last week.

""To decarbonise, we are starting from our efficiency of operations, from electrification of our operations and equipment, and ships. We can do this by using renewable energies and alternative fuels, as well as ensuring proper waste management and biodiversity conservation.”

Silicon added to the hulls of vessels can prevent the buildup of micro-organisms, while sea walls near ferry stations in Abu Dhabi have been built to encourage more widespread marine life.

A further 48 ‘biohuts’ coated in seashells have been submerged to encourage fish populations to thrive close to ports.

Meanwhile, Abu Dhabi Ports holds the record for the world’s most powerful electric tugboat. In 2024, the average peak pull of 78.2 tonnes set a new benchmark for electric tugboat capability.

Slower speeds and more efficient routes are other areas being explored to help reduce the carbon footprint of shipping operations.

“We have recently deployed low Earth orbiting satellites into our operations to give us more precise measurements of our locations for vessels,” said Capt Al Mheiri.

“It allows us to deploy AI tools for voyage and route optimisation. A mix of AI and nature-based solutions, with everything connected in a very holistic manner, will be the best for the future.”

Shipping accounts for an estimated 3 per cent of all global greenhouse gas emissions, the World Economic Forum reported this year.

In July 2023, the UAE Maritime Decarbonisation Centre was launched to ensure the adoption of sustainable practices, technology and policies in the maritime sector.

Sustainable goals

The goals set by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) include a global marine standard for biofuel and a pricing mechanism to discourage the use of unclean fuel.

A legally binding regulatory framework is due to be brought into force by 2027, a move that aims for at least 5 per cent of energy used by the industry to be driven by zero, or near-zero, emission fuel.

In a video speech, opening the two-day conference in Dubai, Suhail Al Mazrouei, Minister of Energy and Infrastructure, said a global effort was required to protect the oceans, while maintaining shipping routes that are critical for the world economy.

“This year's theme, our ocean, our obligation, our opportunity, invites us to reflect deeply on the role we each play in safeguarding maritime ecosystems, ensuring resilience, maritime economics, and utilise innovations for the sustainable future,” he said.

“It is a theme that resonates strongly with the UAE's own maritime vision. This is an opportunity to unite our efforts towards achieving that balance of economic growth with protecting the oceans, which connect us together and keep them healthy for the next generations.”

Tough targets

Targets set by the IMO aim to reduce emissions by at least 20 per cent of 2008 levels by 2030, and at least 70 per cent by 2040.

More than 80 per cent of goods traded are transported by sea, with the industry reliant on fossil fuels.

Greenhouse gases are emitted mainly from burning carbon-intensive bunker fuels, with shipping responsible for about 3 per cent of global CO2 emissions.

Arsenio Dominguez, IMO secretary general, said the sector has made great strides in cutting pollution but more work needs to be done.

“In regards to pollution, we have reduced the oil spills by over 90 per cent in comparison to the 1990s,” he said. “And for nearly 30 years, we have been controlling plastic pollution emanating from ships, but still around 20 per cent of pollution from all the ocean comes from maritime-related industry, either the ship, fishing, or shore infrastructure.

“This is why the IMO also has a plastic strategy to reduce such pollution and in particular focusing on the single use of plastic.”

Mr Dominguez said shipping was responsible for more than 70 per cent of invasive species in the ocean and underwater radiated noise could be cut by 40 per cent if vessels were made more efficient.

Invasive species are spread through shipping channels by two means: ballast water, which transports aquatic organisms around the world; and biofouling, where marine life attaches itself to a ship’s hull, making it less efficient.",https://www.thenationalnews.com/resizer/v2/3MWDK4YNDVD5BNFKJKICIAUJKQ.jpg?smart=true&auth=7c991c85411c9ef1294fd8c94ed370a5a2d7a7a8476a6e3b2a1dff8af9b8ec01&width=1200&height=630,N,,2025-10-02 07:23:43.654997

According to the Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller Center for Zero Carbon Shipping, the IMO LCA Guidelines play a key role in the IMO Net-Zero Framework by allowing companies to estimate the well-to-wake GHG emission factors for marine fuels. The 2024 LCA Guidelines are the latest version, covering the assessment of marine fuels’ life cycle GHG intensity – including scope, methodology, emission factors, and the need for verification and certification.

Emission factors are values that represent the GHG emissions per energy unit of fuel and are used in determining vessels’ compliance with the IMO Net-Zero Framework.

The role of the 2024 LCA guidelines in the IMO NZF

Life cycle analysis (LCA) is used by policymakers to evaluate the environmental aspects of products, processes, and services across production, transportation, use, and disposal (hence “life cycle”). In the context of the IMO Net-Zero Framework (IMO NZF), the IMO LCA Guidelines define how the life cycle GHG emission factors of marine fuels and energy carriers are assessed.

These emission factors are used to calculate a ship’s attained annual GHG fuel intensity (GFI) and the extent to which it meets, exceeds, or misses the targets set by the IMO NZF. The 2024 LCA Guidelines are the latest version of the IMO LCA Guidelines, adopted at MEPC 81 in March 2024.

The 2024 LCA Guidelines use ISO standards 14044: 2006 and 14040: 2006 as the basis for the methodology, principles, framework, and quantification of GHG emissions. These two ISO standards, which are widely used by voluntary reporting frameworks and policymakers, provide guidance on each phase of the LCA as well as the overall process.

Basics of the 2024 LCA Guidelines

Scope

The 2024 LCA Guidelines include a methodology for calculating the GHG emission factors of marine fuels, specifically focusing on carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O). The guidelines define the well-to-tank (WTT) stage as emissions from feedstock extraction/cultivation/acquisition/recovery, conversion to fuel, transportation and bunkering, while the tank-to-wake (TTW) stage covers the onboard combustion and conversion of fuel.

GHG emission factors

The WTW GHG emission factor of fuels is expressed in grams of CO2 equivalent per megajoule (gCO2eq/MJ). The term “equivalent” here refers to standardization of the three covered GHGs (CO2, CH4, and N2O) to the climate impact of CO2.

These emission factors are used to calculate ships’ attained annual GFI, as described in Regulation 33 of the IMO NZF. The emission factor of the fuel is multiplied by the annual energy consumption of that fuel to obtain a ‘GFI compliance balance’, converting intensity values into total GHG emissions in terms of tonnes CO2eq.

A compliance balance that is in deficit (meaning that the GFI is too high) must be addressed through purchasing Remedial Units or Surplus Units from other ships.

Sustainability

The 2024 LCA Guidelines also include ten sustainability themes or aspects, each with its own objective and metric. The criteria are limited to the environmental impacts of fuel production and consumption, covering elements such as air, water, and resources quality and/or availability, as well as the impact on changing land use. These themes are broadly described and are pending further guidance to be developed by the IMO.

Fuel Lifecycle Label

The 2024 LCA Guidelines also include the concept of the ‘Fuel Lifecycle Label’ (FLL).

The framework’s supporting guidelines will define zero- and near-zero-emission fuels, reward mechanisms, emissions accounting, certification, and how a central fund will be governed. These guidelines will be crucial in further supporting the energy transition and ensuring a just and equitable transition.

A recent Global Maritime Forum insight brief provides an analysis and explanation of the IMO’s reward mechanism. This guide—written before October’s expected adoption—summarises its key takeaways.

Why is a reward mechanism for e-fuels in shipping needed?

Through the Net-Zero Framework, shipping emissions will be slowly restricted over time through Global Fuel Intensity (GFI) targets, which are measured in a ship’s annual greenhouse gas emissions per unit of energy used. The GFI promotes gradual decarbonisation and transitional technologies but is unlikely to sufficiently incentivise long-term solutions such as e-fuels early on. This is why a reward mechanism is needed.

It is projected that by 2030, the IMO will raise around $11–12 billion annually through penalties from non-compliance with the framework. These funds will then be channelled into rewards for zero- and near-zero-emission (ZNZ) fuels and support a just, equitable transition in which no country or region is left behind.

The IMO reward mechanism can be further tailored to provide financial incentives for using ZNZ fuels. Tailoring rewards to scalable solutions such as e-fuels can help close their competitiveness gap with transitional fuels, such as liquefied natural gas or biofuels.

Why is it important to support e-fuels in shipping?

To keep the shipping sector on track to achieve its stated goal of net-zero emissions by 2050, at least 5% of the industry’s energy demand should be met by scalable alternatives, such as e-fuels, by 2030. E-fuels are critical because they provide a scalable pathway to decarbonise global shipping.

To realise this potential, it’s important to build out the maritime value chain early on so different segments can de-risk one another, enable uptake at scale, and support full commercialisation in the long run. However, e-fuels face high upfront costs and uncertain returns.

E-fuel producers need affordable financing, but shipping companies (offtakers) are hesitant to commit to long-term contracts due to limited supply and unclear price trends. At the same time, investors generally seek quick, low-risk returns, which e-fuels cannot currently provide. This mismatch, often described as the sector’s ‘chicken-and-egg problem’, makes e-fuel growth difficult without policy intervention.

What are the key components of the IMO’s reward mechanism?

The impact of the reward will be driven by two main components of the reward:

Fuel eligibility – defining which fuels qualify for rewards.

Reward level-setting – determining the timing, size, and distribution of rewards

Read our earlier insight brief to learn more about reward eligibility and compliance.

What are the various design options for the reward mechanism?

According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, four key criteria should be considered when evaluating the feasibility and efficiency of a climate-related policy: environmental effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, distributional considerations, and institutional feasibility. Translated into a shipping context, that looks like the following:

Investment certainty (Environmental effectiveness): Shipowners need long-term revenue assurance, especially for high-risk commitments like e-fuels which entail long-term offtake agreements, to confidently invest in zero-emission fuels.

Price discovery (Cost-effectiveness): It’s essential to ensure transparent pricing of alternative fuels in emerging markets to prevent both under- and over-subsidisation.

Accessibility (Distributional considerations): Rewards should be accessible to shipowners across regions and income levels to ensure the system does not disproportionately benefit larger companies.

Institutional feasibility:

Limiting liability: Fund allocations must be controlled so demand for rewards does not exceed what is actually available.

Administrative burden: The mechanism should be practical for the IMO to implement and manage.

Political feasibility: The system needs to align with IMO principles and remain politically viable.

What is important to consider when determining fuel eligibility?

There are three main ways the IMO could choose to determine which fuels are eligible under its rewards scheme:

Technology-centric, based on the fuel’s production pathway (e.g., e-fuels, biofuels)

Emission-centric, based on greenhouse gas intensity

Hybrid, a combination of both approaches.

According to the insight brief, the best way for the rewards mechanism to deliver a positive impact on the four considerations outlined above would be through either a technology-centric or a hybrid approach. These approaches would limit the scope of eligible fuels and specifically target e-fuels while significantly increasing investment certainty in the long-term fuels and limiting the liability of the reward fund.

How can the rewards be set, and what are the costs and benefits?

Reward levels can be determined in three main ways, each of which has its trade-offs:

Administratively-set rates: A flat administrative annual rate is simple and predictable. However, this approach does not allow the market to discover its most efficient pricing. There is also a risk that payouts could exceed the fund's assets, creating a potential liability. Finally, an annual fixed rate does not give shipowners long-term certainty, which can undermine investor confidence. However, both these risks could be mitigated by distributing a limited number of multi-year, fixed-rate rewards, which would offer investment certainty while limiting liability.

Auction-based rewards: With an auction, multi-year rewards are allocated through competitive bidding. The shipowners that win auctions will have investment certainty since they know their reward upfront for multiple years. Because auctions are based on a set volume, there’s no risk that the fund amount is exceeded. Plus, competition drives price discovery of the rewarded fuel. A downside of auctions is their complexity, as they can’t be too strict (otherwise shipowners won’t apply) or too loose (as companies may pull out later). They’re also a heavy administrative and technical burden for the IMO.

Hybrid models: With a hybrid model, rewards are linked to external benchmarks and could incorporate both administrative and auction-based mechanisms. For example, using ‘contracts for difference’ would involve paying out the cost difference between the conventional fuel and the fuel being rewarded. This is controlled by setting a cap for the rewarded fuel, either administratively or through auction. With this approach, shipowners have certainty about what their new fuel will cost. It also simultaneously closes the cost gap directly. However, there is still a risk of exceeding the fund limits since total payouts depend on the price fluctuations of the conventional fuel. It also adds complexity for both the shipowner and IMO administration.

What is the predicted timeline for the rewards?

The timeline for reward mechanisms is critical. Between late 2025 and 2027, the IMO measures are expected to be adopted and enter into force. Rewards will be essential to achieving the 5% e-fuel uptake by 2030, but will require further national and regional support to avoid delays in offtake commitments.",https://www.globalmaritimeforum.org/assets/images/gmf-logo.png,N,,2025-10-02 07:23:57.263758
