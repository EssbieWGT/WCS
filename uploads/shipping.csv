This year’s Forum took place with physical attendance at the Eugenides Foundation and was broadcast live worldwide, attracting hundreds of viewers and Members from the Institute’s 27 international Branches.

In her opening remarks, Ms. Natalia Margioli-Komninou, Managing Director of HMC & ICS Greek Branch, reflected on the Branch’s 20-year journey of promoting education and professionalism. She highlighted its vital role in shaping generations of maritime professionals through knowledge-sharing and networking. Ms. Margioli emphasized the importance of the ICS community – a network built on trust, respect, and a shared passion for shipping – and presented two major new initiatives; The Company Membership Scheme allows organizations to connect, access professional training, and tap into ICS’s global network, creating growth opportunities for both individuals and companies. The partnership with the Chartered Management Institute (CMI) offers management and leadership programmes that equip professionals with essential soft skills for success in today’s global markets.

Both aim to foster leadership development and enhance the professional capacity of individuals and organizations within the maritime industry. She concluded by reaffirming the Branch’s mission to continue growing alongside the sector and to uphold its core values of learning, collaboration, and excellence.

In his welcome address, Mr. Nikolas Tsavliris, Chairman of the ICS Greek Branch, spoke with heartfelt emotion and deep respect, describing the 20th ICS Annual Forum as not only a milestone but a moment for gratitude and reflection. He underlined the Forum’s role as a platform for meaningful discussion in today’s complex and fragmented world. Drawing inspiration from the original Greek concept of dialogos, Mr. Tsavliris highlighted that dialogue is not a contest of opinions, but a shared pursuit of understanding, the very essence of the ICS mission.

The panel discussion, moderated with great insight by Mr. Simon Ward, FICS, Director, Ursa Shipbrokers, brought together a distinguished lineup of speakers:

Mr. Polys V. Hajioannou, Chairman & CEO, Safe Bulkers Inc., and President, Cyprus Union of Shipowners

Mr. George G. Mangos, Principal, Interunity Group

Ms. Ismini Panagiotidi, CEO & Founder, Pavimar S.A. and Icon Energy Corp.

Ms. Milena Pappa, Board Member & Commercial Director, Star Bulk Carriers Corp.

Mr. Thanasis Martinos, Managing Director of Eastern Mediterranean Maritime Ltd., contributed to the forum via a pre-recorded video message.

The conversation covered key pillars shaping the shipping industry today — market outlook, geopolitics, environmental regulation (IMO & emissions), and professional development.

In his remarks, Mr Martinos noted that shipping is going through challenging times, and highlighted early indications that freight rates for VLCCs, Capesize bulk carriers, and container ships are expected to be higher next year. He added that he believes future freight market forecasts will become increasingly accurate as AI-enhanced econometric modeling continues to evolve.

Mr Hajioannou highlighted that many shipowners remain skeptical of the current IMO Net-Zero Framework and emphasized the long-term strategic impact of China’s dominance in shipbuilding. He stressed the need for coordinated dialogue among leading maritime nations to manage this structural imbalance. He also described shipping as a dynamic industry offering exceptional opportunities for professional growth. Mr Mangos cautioned against adopting unrealistic decarbonisation targets and noted that geopolitical volatility makes long-term commercial planning challenging. He highlighted the differing capacities of the liner and tramp sectors to influence global policy and stressed the importance of navigating market interdependencies carefully.

Ms Pappa focused on the technical and regulatory challenges facing decarbonisation, including green fuel incentives, lifecycle assessments, and fuel costs. She highlighted progress made through engine efficiency improvements but stressed the need for modern port infrastructure and scalable alternative fuels. Last, she highligted that personal integrity and transparency, alongside technical competence, are essential for anyone seeking a career in shipping. Ms Panagiotidi noted how commercial decision-making now requires constant adaptation to geopolitical uncertainty. She added that shipowners have historically had to make decisions under disruption, and recent developments have further shaken traditional decision-making frameworks in the industry. She observed that formal qualifications remain essential, but success increasingly depends on navigating complex markets with skill and foresight.

Pacific Environment’s climate policy director, Davina Hurt, said, “Now is the time to act”.","Following last month’s one year delay to the Net Zero Framework (NZF) NGO’s are demanding that governments take decisive action to accelerate the industry’s decarbonisation plans.

A US-led coalition scuppered the IMO’s attempts to agree a comprehensive road map that would see shipping substantially reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to a fraction of those recorded in 2008.

The IMO set out a clear pathway to 2050 with interim targets for 2030 and 2040 with many nation states already committed to delivering the reductions in emissions and many vessel operators investing in the green technology that will achieve the industry’s goals.

In a move that will find support from many in the maritime sector, five NGO’s, Environmental Defense Fund, Pacific Environment, Seas At Risk, Solutions for Our Climate, and Transport & Environment, have set out a six-point action plan that they are calling on governments to commit to in a bid to make sure that the maritime meets its climate obligations.

The plan calls for governments to: Develop and implement a national action plan on international shipping emissions. Set clear domestic targets and mandates for low- and zero-emission marine fuels and vessels. Deploy financial and regulatory incentives to accelerate ship efficiency and fuel transition. Enhance port infrastructure and support for alternative fuels, as well as technologies such as wind propulsion and electrification. Ensure a just and globally equitable transition, especially for developing and small-island nations and support urgent action on short-lived climate forcers (methane and black carbon) emitted by international shipping.

Postponement of the NZF was a disappointment for many within and outside the industry but John Yum, head of shipping team at Solutions for Our Climate, argues that individual states can still take action to reduce emissions by expanding green corridors or investing in zero or near zero fuels. He said: “Taking proactive steps now will demonstrate governments’ commitment to achieving net-zero shipping by 2050 and help ensure that, when the IMO reconvenes, it can move forward with stronger ambition rather than face another setback.” Meanwhile, Pacific Environment believe that overshooting the Paris target of limiting Earth’s warming to 1.5degs has already been missed and blames “bad actors” for “bullying” countries into inaction.

Brazil was confident global unity would prevail at November's climate talks, but the exceptionally undiplomatic scenes at the International Maritime Organization (IMO), the UN shipping regulator, presented an uglier possibility.

Even with the United States skipping the climate summit, President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva called for good faith negotiations at COP30 and a rejection of the ""pressure and threats"" witnessed at the IMO.

Washington's conduct -- threatening sanctions, visa freezes and port levies on nations that didn't vote its way -- was not ""typical"" of the IMO, Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez told AFP.

AFP interviewed Dominguez, a Panamanian nearly halfway through his four-year term as IMO chief, at COP30 in Belem. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

Q: The shipping carbon price was expected to be approved until US officials threatened retaliation against nations to get the vote delayed. Is this normal conduct at the IMO?

A: ""In my 28 years I have never experienced that kind of meeting at the IMO. It was not a typical IMO meeting. Geopolitical situations around the world right now are different to where they were in the past. We all know that.

""But for me, the task is to keep the momentum, maintain the approach, and whenever we come back to the negotiations in future, I call on everyone to do it in the normal spirit of compromise and cooperation that we carry out at IMO.""

Q: How can the IMO's 176 member states rebuild trust after this?

A: ""I can tell you that multilateralism is very much alive at IMO. And that's what I told everyone -- not to judge the organization, or come too quickly to conclusions, from the outcome of one specific topic in one specific meeting.

""For us, we need to learn from it. I am very much in support of multilateralism. We have had conversations and discussions about how to deal with geopolitical aspects.""

Q: US President Donald Trump called the shipping emissions deal a ""scam"" and pressure from Washington clearly influenced its delay. Is the scheme dead?

A: ""The negotiations continue, and they are ongoing. It is by no means a done deal. The process will continue ahead.

""It is important to take their comments and concerns on board, and have further bilateral and multilateral conversations ahead of the next session. They may have proposals to put on the table for us to consider as well. And that's how we make progress.

""I work with all countries, and all governments, at any given time. My job is to listen to what everybody is saying and see how we can accommodate and find those common areas that might allow us to make progress.""

Q: Is the industry still committed to decarbonizing?

A: ""Our goal -- that we all agree at IMO back in 2023 -- is to decarbonize the sector by around 2050. And we all maintain that goal, regardless of the state of play right now. We continue to make progress... and I am convinced actually that the organization is serious about decarbonizing by around 2050.""

Pinnington released the latest edition of Making Waves November 4 through publisher Rethink Press.

Pinnington said the book is the result of a year’s worth of research and interviews. It also includes a new in-depth section on the U.S. maritime industry, as well as new chapters on maritime technology, the maritime media, AI and public relations, social media and crisis communications.

“Maritime now has its highest profile in decades, and this is an opportunity and threat,” he said. “As we have seen with President Trump challenging China’s maritime industry and with the IMO Net Zero framework being paused, maritime is now front and center of the news agenda.”

Companies within the maritime industry historically have endeavored to keep a low profile, but that approach may need to change, Pinnington argues in “Making Waves.”

“Times have changed, and maritime needs to start prioritizing professional communications to build authentic reputation and trust,” he said.

A big part of that story is the industry-wide effort and cost associated with decarbonization and how technology and alternative fuels are driving down emissions.

Pinnington said the book is further aimed at maritime business leaders who want to professionalize their communications.

“I want ‘Making Waves II’ to give proven ideas so businesses can better do themselves justice,” he said. “The hard reality is that many maritime firms do not have the reputation they deserve. They are trapped in repeating the same year with minimal growth and average marketing. However, if you communicate authentic good behavior on digital media and in the abundant maritime press, your reputation will rise. And research has shown that, with a stronger reputation, your business is more likely to grow.”

The new edition of “Making Waves” features interviews with leading industry figures like Marina Hadjipateras and Nir Gartzman, marine autonomy specialist Jack Dougherty, entrepreneur Darren Shelton, Texas maritime figure Niels Aalund, American maritime lawyer Charlie Papavizas, Great Lakes maritime professionals Ian Hirt and William Friedman, inland waterways specialist Scott Sigman and PR thought leader Stephen Waddington.

Polaris Media is a maritime and engineering specialist PR firm. Pinnington founded the company in Liverpool, UK, in 2011. Pinnington expanded the company to Chicago in 2022. Polaris has worked for more than 100 clients, including ship builders, boat builders, hovercraft builders, shipping lines, ports, flag states, classification societies, equipment makers, cybersecurity firms, professional service companies, seafarer charities and trade associations. The firm has clients in the United States, United Kingdom, India and Europe.

Polaris helped to recharter the Chicago chapter of the International Propeller Club in 2023. Following a 15-year hiatus, the club was named International Port Chapter of the Year in 2024.

Pinnington published the first edition of “Making Waves” in 2021. The book won the Chartered Institute of Public Relations Silver Award for best publication in 2022.

As informed, the engine uses the Diesel principle combined with dual-fuel Liquid Gas Injection technology, similar to prior engines running on methanol and LPG. The engine incorporates safety features specific to ammonia, including containment systems, sensors, system ventilation, and double-walled piping.

Ammonia as a marine fuel has several technical advantages, Everllence explains. It produces zero CO₂ when derived from renewable sources and has low sulphur-oxide and particulate emissions. Its high volumetric energy density allows more compact storage compared with hydrogen, and it can be stored as a liquid at moderate pressures. Ammonia’s slow combustion rate is compatible with two-stroke engine designs, and existing global production infrastructure supports scalability and operational reliability.

The first engine is expected to be operational in 2026, with testing and bedding-in scheduled beforehand. Extensive testing has already been conducted, including over 800 trials since mid-2023, with safety measures reviewed alongside relevant authorities.

The ME-LGIA engine will support digital connectivity to allow real-time monitoring, performance optimization, and operational data collection.

As the maritime industry’s leading engine designer, we are in a unique position to advance the green transition and know that bringing new fuels to market is not just innovation – it’s imperative for zero-carbon shipping. In this context, ammonia is a vital piece of the puzzle.

Less than 10% of ship steel remains traceable to high-quality reuse or low-carbon steelmaking routes, with the vast majority downcycled into low-value applications, she added.
Additionally, green and digital shipping corridors, such as the Singapore-Long Beach, were ""brilliant examples"" of promoting maritime decarbonization, according to Besley-Gould.
SSI would now like to look at how a similar approach could be taken to integrate co-benefits, Besley-Gould said.","A clear opportunity exists to expand the maritime sector's decarbonization focus to the embodied environmental impacts of ship materials, beginning with the circularity potential of steel and pathways toward greener steel, said Ellie Besley-Gould, CEO of the Sustainable Shipping Initiative.

""A huge transition is happening, with genuine market signals from the industry to achieve maritime decarbonization,"" Besley-Gould told Platts, part of S&P Global Commodity Insights, in an interview.

""Our members, who include very forward-thinking industry players, are leading the industry by acting on their carbon footprint and are calling upon the SSI to identify and fill in gaps where uncertainty remains,"" she said via an e-mail on Nov. 13.

According to Besley-Gould, SSI continues to deliver on its road map set across six key areas-- oceans, people, community, finance, transparency and energy, including Scope 3 emissions.

So, SSI is also focusing on ship life cycle management, among other aspects, she said.

Steel is the dominant material in ships, accounting for about 70%-90% of a ship's total mass and driving one of the largest shares of Scope 3 emissions, factoring in extraction, refining and manufacturing, Besley-Gould said.

As a major wave of ship retirements approaches, about 150 million metric tons of ship steel will become available for recycling before 2032, she said, adding that this was a ""strategic climate lever"" that falls within this decade rather than after 2050.

According to Besley-Gould, with the Hong Kong Convention entering into force in 2025, a global minimum standard is now in place, providing greater confidence to invest in upgraded recycling capacity.

Using recovered marine steel in electric arc furnace production can reduce life cycle emissions by up to 90% compared with using new primary steel made from iron ore. However, today, the system mostly fails to capture that benefit, she said.

Less than 10% of ship steel remains traceable to high-quality reuse or low-carbon steelmaking routes, with the vast majority downcycled into low-value applications, she added.

One of the major hurdles is timing, according to Besley-Gould.

End-of-life decisions are often made in the last months of operation when the original owner has already lost leverage, she said. At that point, recycling becomes a cost rather than an opportunity, she said.

""On the demand side, what we need to see is fleet owners looking for green steel in their supply chain... And on the supply side, we would love ship owners to be thinking about recycling ships at midlife instead of end-of-life so that we can start well,"" she added.

Circularity is most achievable when embedded from design through to end-of-life, not just at the point of recycling, she said.

Coordination across the shipping and steel sectors, supported by global and regional regulations, and de-risking demand-generating policies are also vital to close material loops, she added.

Additionally, SSI is undertaking significant work on marine biodiversity and ocean health. This includes linking biofouling to energy efficiency, the impact of slow steaming on underwater radiated noise and whale strikes, as well as human impact, such as the mariners' welfare, Besley-Gould said.

Shipping's transformative pathway

The delay in the International Maritime Organization Net-Zero Framework ratification was disappointing, Besley-Gould said.

""The IMO MEPC83 outcome has, of course, maintained a level of uncertainty... There is still unpredictability over whether it is possible to have an incentivization scheme and whether the reward mechanism is appropriate, what it should ideally look like, and how the carbon tax proceeds would be spent,"" she said.

""I think while the mechanism would have accelerated the transition, it is nevertheless underway,"" she said, adding that a huge opportunity exists for shipping to not just transform itself but become a transformative industry that inspires others.

SSI is working with its members to explore how best to support net zero while continuing to deliver on its road map, she said.

""Although SSI remains fuel-agnostic, it highlights a wide range of alternative fuels under consideration -- from LNG and bio-based fuels to methanol, ammonia and synthetic options -- underscoring the need to evaluate each on sustainability criteria across the full fuel life cycle,"" she added.

""If we can combine energy efficiency with clean fuels, then there is kind of a double win,"" she said, referring to measures such as slow steaming, wind sails, hull coating and bubble lubrication.

Additionally, green and digital shipping corridors, such as the Singapore-Long Beach, were ""brilliant examples"" of promoting maritime decarbonization, according to Besley-Gould.

In 2023, the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore, the Port of Los Angeles and the Port of Long Beach unveiled a partnership strategy for a Green and Digital Shipping Corridor across the Pacific Ocean.

SSI would now like to look at how a similar approach could be taken to integrate co-benefits, Besley-Gould said. ""So, how would slow steaming not only reduce emissions but also noise levels and whale strikes? Can one also implement human-side excellence and track crew welfare?""

""It will be exciting when we see emissions data and other things that the GDSCs are measuring, to extrapolate it to scale and see what is possible,"" she added.",https://www.spglobal.com/content/dam/spglobal/ci/en/images/platts/general/favicon.ico,N,,2025-11-14 11:57:09.012803

The future of the industry is not in its past—it begins with action today.” Sian Prior, Shipping Director, Seas At Risk, said: “We simply cannot afford to keep delaying climate action.
Full Report Sources: Environmental Defense Fund, Pacific Environment, Seas At Risk, Solutions for Our Climate, and Transport & Environment","On Energy and Transport Day at COP 30, Environmental Defense Fund, Pacific Environment, Seas At Risk, Solutions for Our Climate, and Transport & Environment call on national governments to urgently accelerate action to reduce shipping emissions, especially following the recent U.S.-led postponement in the adoption of a binding global shipping measure at the International Maritime Organization (IMO). The delay in adoption of the IMO Net-Zero Framework (NZF), the first UN-mandated fuel mandate and carbon pricing mechanism on any sector, by one year risks slowing down industry-wide decarbonisation efforts at a moment when decisive action is needed most.

Shipping accounts for roughly 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions, and the IMO’s 2023 Strategy sets a clear pathway to achieve net-zero emissions from shipping by 2050, with interim goals for 2030 and 2040 that countries have already committed to deliver. While Member States continue negotiations on the NZF, national governments must step up and act domestically and regionally to keep the transition on course, ensuring investment, infrastructure, and innovation continue to drive the industry forward.

We therefore call on all governments to commit to the following national actions for shipping decarbonisation:

Develop and implement a national action plan on international shipping emissions

Set clear domestic targets and mandates for low- and zero-emission marine fuels and vessels

Deploy financial and regulatory incentives to accelerate ship efficiency and fuel transition

Enhance port infrastructure and support for alternative fuels, as well as technologies such as wind propulsion and electrification

Ensure a just and globally equitable transition, especially for developing and small-island nations

Support urgent action on short-lived climate forcers (methane and black carbon) emitted by international shipping

John Yum, Head of Shipping Team, Solutions for Our Climate, said: “The postponement of the IMO’s Net Zero Framework is deeply disappointing, but it also gives governments a chance to take meaningful action. Instead of just waiting for international negotiations to resume, countries like Korea should take immediate steps to decarbonize their shipping sectors — for instance, by continuing to commit to expanding green shipping corridors and increasing investment in ZNZ fuels. Taking proactive steps now will demonstrate governments’ commitment to achieving net-zero shipping by 2050 and help ensure that, when the IMO reconvenes, it can move forward with stronger ambition rather than face another setback.”

Davina Hurt, Climate Policy Director, Pacific Environment, said: “We now face a reality we long anticipated — overshooting the 1.5°C target is inevitable. Member states were bullied into delaying the International Maritime Organization’s Net-Zero Framework, but obstruction by bad actors cannot continue to force inaction at a time when decisive action is most needed. We call on all member states and zero-emission leaders like California to step up and act on climate change by truly decarbonizing maritime shipping. There is only one planet. We must stand together for the health of our ocean and for future generations. Now is the time to act.”

Mark Brownstein, Senior Vice President, Energy Transition, Environmental Defense Fund, said: “The development and deployment of clean, alternative fuels for global shipping is not only good for stabilizing the climate and improving public health—it also creates economic opportunities for those countries and companies that embrace innovation. The International Maritime Organization’s Net-Zero Framework is rooted in this reality. Leaders can and must act now to implement it. The future of the industry is not in its past—it begins with action today.”

Sian Prior, Shipping Director, Seas At Risk, said: “We simply cannot afford to keep delaying climate action. In the face of the climate crisis, countries need to start taking leaps, not steps, towards decarbonising shipping, including addressing short-lived climate pollutants such as methane and black carbon. Meanwhile, bullying tactics must be called out and multilateralism must take precedence. Steering the ship towards greener shipping doesn’t have to be overcomplicated: scaling up wind propulsion, finding financial incentives to adopt cleaner fuels whilst ensuring a just transition are achievable if we all work together.”

As the global community gathers in Belém, we urge governments to seize this opportunity to take concrete actions that will ensure the maritime industry contributes its fair share to combating climate change.

Early preparation around these regimes is closely tied to maintaining their competitive position.

Ahead of his contribution to the Tanker 2030 conference in Singapore, Bureau Veritas Marine & Offshore global market leader for tankers Robert Elliot described how operators had to make informed choices on fuel sourcing and pooling, alongside carefully managing operational performance.

He set out two main pathways for owners: securing access to sustainable fuels, which offers greater control and relative stability, or joining pooling agreements that provide flexibility but depend on robust contracts to manage price volatility.

Mr Elliot noted the best balance between these approaches depends on a vessel’s trading profile and fuel options, including access to alternative energy sources, and the ability to anticipate and model these factors had become a commercial capability rather than a narrow compliance task.

The extraordinary meeting is to be resumed in 12 months. In the meantime, the member states want to continue working towards a consensus on the regulations.

The IMO's net zero framework was included as a new chapter in the draft revision of Annex VI of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL) at the 83rd session of the MEPC in April 2025. However, without the USA, which did not attend this meeting. It includes international regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from ships from 2023 and contains two key elements: a global fuel standard and a global mechanism for pricing ship emissions.

The Trump administration had - predictably - previously threatened IMO member states with severe legal sanctions if they supported the MEPC's draft CO2 emissions regulations. Promoting ""activist-driven climate policies"" under the IMO net-zero framework could lead to sanctions, tariffs, port fees, economic sanctions related to US government contracts or visa restrictions for seafarers, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy warned in a joint statement ahead of the meeting.

From the US government's perspective, the framework is tantamount to a ""European-led neo-colonial export of global climate regulation"". This is because, by and large, the new net zero framework, even if it is not usually discussed as a ""tax"", will be the first and only global financial sanction for carbon emissions. The US announcement then includes a rather blunt threat to penalise countries that vote in favour of the IMO's carbon tax scheme by imposing costs on them. ""Our colleagues in the IMO should brace themselves,"" warned the US ministers.

“We need some other action, other regulations to support something different from alternative fuels.

Kourkountis, who is also the Technical Director at Sea Traders, explained that only 1% of the amount of fuel required for shipping by the controversial IMO Net-Zero Framework that got postponed in October is available at this time, and producing that fuel is not something we could do “the very next day,” he emphasized, adding that the energy required to produce ammonia and methanol would be greater than the energy they generate.

“We need some other action, other regulations to support something different from alternative fuels. We do not have energy from batteries, while nuclear energy is not ready to be applied, even though it would certainly solve the global energy problem, but environmentally the problem remains, since nuclear waste exists,” he said.

Echoing those views, ABS Business Development Manager Angelos Minakis presented the key points of contention in IMO, saying the organization has made a strategic mistake by condemning liquefied natiural gas while theoretically other fuels don’t exist. Looking forward, he said IMO should shift focus on re-engagement and consensus-building among member states.

The European Union (EU), the Port of Rotterdam and the Namibian Ports Authority (Namport) have signed a deal to advance the expansion of Lüderitz Port at Angra Point.

The agreement forms part of the EU–Namibia strategic partnership on sustainable raw materials value chains and renewable hydrogen.

Under the deal, the EU has committed N$13 million to support planning for the port’s expansion.

The agreement was signed during the closing session of its Africa regional workshop on Global Gateway Green Shipping Corridors in Walvis Bay.

Maritime transport must undergo rapid change to cut emissions, European Union (EU) ambassador to Namibia Ana Beatriz Martins told delegates at the workshop.

She said the sector’s contribution to global emissions demands urgent action from governments and industry.

She addressed representatives from African partnership countries, the International Maritime Organisation, the African Union Commission, port authorities and private operators.

The discussions come as world leaders gather at the 30th Conference of Parties (COP30) climate conference in Belém, Brazil.

The workshop is the first of three regional sessions to be held worldwide. Martins said hosting it in Namibia shows Europe’s confidence in African partners and Namibia’s growing role in green shipping.

“No better place than Namibia to show us the way on green shipping,” she said.

She outlined the long-standing cooperation between the EU, IMO, and African countries across transport sectors, such as roads, rail, aviation safety, and sustainable fuels.

She said these partnerships have strengthened mobility and connectivity on the continent.

Martins reminded delegates of the urgency of the climate crisis.

The EU has submitted its Nationally Determined Contribution for 2035, committing to cut emissions by 66% to 72% and aiming to become the first climate-neutral continent by 2050.

She noted that Europe remains the world’s largest provider of climate finance, with €31.7 billion contributed in 2024 and €11 billion in private finance for developing countries.

Last week at COP30, President Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah revealed that Namibia would require about US$15 billion, or roughly N$270 billion, to meet its climate mitigation and adaptation goals by 2030.

Most of this funding would rely on international support.

Namibia’s adaptation efforts in agriculture, water, health, biodiversity and infrastructure would require about US$6 billion (around N$108 billion), with 90% expected to come from external sources.

Its mitigation measures were projected to cost about US$9 billion (roughly N$162 billion), with 10% expected to be financed locally.

Martina said momentum toward decarbonising shipping remains strong, despite the IMO’s delayed decision on the Net Zero Framework.

She said the EU wants to support long-term competitiveness and economic growth across Africa and Europe through cleaner shipping routes.

She also pointed out challenges, such as geopolitical pressures, high investment costs, renewable fuel prices, and limited infrastructure.

The Global Gateway’s Green Shipping Corridors initiative responds to requests from shippers, fuel producers, port operators, and maritime authorities.

Martins said the long-term goal is to establish shipping routes powered by renewable fuels and supported by ports able to supply clean energy. She said this transition requires robust financing.

Erongo governor Natalia |Goagoses welcomed the delegates from across Africa to the workshop, which was held under the theme “Accelerating Inclusive Green Shipping in Africa: Energy Efficiency, Innovation and Finance for a Low-Carbon Maritime Future.”

She praised the International Maritime Organization, the European Union and MTCC Africa for supporting sustainable and inclusive maritime development.",https://www.observer24.com.na/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/cropped-WO-App-Icon-Apple-1-32x32.jpeg,N,,2025-11-14 06:57:15.359762

The enforceable agreement requires the ports to develop and implement charging and fuelling infrastructure plans and includes annual reporting requirements and agency oversight.

The agreement, which the SCAQMD Board approved 7 November, commits the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles to developing and implementing plans for zero-emissions infrastructure for equipment types in three phases, starting with a draft plan in May 2027, followed by approved plans in place for all categories by the end of 2029.

According to SCAQM, the cooperative agreement prioritises the development of zero-emission infrastructure at the Ports—the first critical step towards eliminating emissions from cargo handling equipment, harbour craft, trucks, trains, and ocean-going vessels and attaining clean air in the region.

Taken together, the actions build on the voluntary, landmark Clean Air Action Plan that has delivered remarkable progress in cutting emissions from port-related sources, including reductions of 90% in diesel particulate matter, 68% in nitrogen oxides and 98% in sulphur oxides from port-related sources since 2005.

In the months ahead, the ports will also continue working with SCAQMD on additional “CAAP Plus” measures that will focus on emission-reducing strategies related to cleaner oceangoing vessels, the largest source of emissions at the ports, through strategies like the Environmental Ship Index Incentive Programs.

The measures could also include strategies like committing Clean Truck Fund Rate revenue to subsidise the transition to zero-emission trucks and infrastructure, developing a zero-emissions drayage truck utilisation incentive program and consulting annually with SCAQMD on spending priorities.

“We are pleased to move forward with this cooperative agreement and accelerate the progress we’ve achieved by making our operations cleaner and more efficient,” said Long Beach Harbor Commission President Frank Colonna. “It will deliver tangible results and a sustainable future without risking jobs or cargo throughput.”

“I commend the South Coast Air Quality Management District for its willingness to compromise, and all of the work by staff from the agency and both ports in recent months to develop this agreement in a transparent and open process,” said Port of Long Beach CEO Mario Cordero.

“Collaboration has been a key to our success in reducing environmental impacts. Together, with the participation and active support of the ports, SCAQMD, labor, industry, energy suppliers and utilities, technology developers and community representatives – which this agreement will intensify – I am confident we can reach our shared goal of a zero-emissions future.”

“Environmental progress and economic leadership are no longer competing goals – they must move forward together,” said Long Beach Mayor Rex Richardson.

“This collaborative agreement marks a major step toward a more sustainable port complex that protects community health, advances our climate action commitments and strengthens regional economic growth with good-paying jobs. By accelerating zero-emission infrastructure, we will deliver cleaner air, healthier neighbourhoods and a greener global supply chain that reaches far beyond our two cities.”

EnviTec Biogas on Thursday (13 November) said TT-Line signed a bio-LNG supply contract following a trial bunkering.

Some 40 metric tonnes (mt) of bio-LNG from EnviTec Biogas was supplied to TT-Line’s Ro-Pax ferry Peter Pan in Travemünde, Germany.

“We are delighted to be able to supply TT-Line’s Ro-Pax ferries, a combination of passenger and vehicle ships, with our renewable fuel bio-LNG,” said Markus Pille, Managing Director of EnviTec Energy GmbH & Co. KG.

Since the entry into force of the EU Regulation on the use of renewable and low-carbon fuels in maritime transport, also known as FuelEU Maritime, shipping companies such as TT-Line are required to comply with binding limits for the greenhouse gas intensity of the energy used on board. The regulation applies to all ships in the EU with a gross tonnage of more than 5,000 in commercial passenger or freight transport, regardless of the flag they fly.

“Our Peter Pan, together with her sister ship Nils Holgersson, is the largest LNG-powered Ro-Pax ferry in the world. These ferries represent far more to us than merely meeting legal requirements; we are preparing ourselves and our fleet as well as possible for a sustainable future,” said Torben Nikolay, CFO of TT-Line.

“We have already carried out extensive bio-LNG bunkerings by bunker barge this year and are now pleased to have found, in EnviTec Biogas, a German partner for particularly flexible bunkering by truck.”

The International Bunkering Industry Association (IBIA) will be hosting its flagship Annual Convention in Hong Kong at the Hong Kong Convention Exhibition & Convention Centre between 18 to 20 November 2025, as part of Hong Kong Maritime Week.

Caroline Yang, CEO of Hong Lam Marine Pte Ltd, Past Chair of the Singapore Shipping Association (SSA); Former Vice Chair of the International Chamber of Shipping (ICS), discusses the overall state of Singapore’s bunkering sector and its future evolution with bunkering publication Manifold Times.

MT: How is bunker tanker owner and operator Hong Lam Marine helping Singapore navigate the transition towards alternative marine fuels?

Hong Lam Marine, an industry staple for over 40 years, has always aimed to keep pace or even lead the Singapore bunkering sector. We were amongst the first to build and in June 2005 introduced the 9,330 dwt Leadership which was then Singapore’s largest bunker tanker. Today, we operate the 9,338 dwt Oracle which is the largest in Singapore (as per MPA data on 8 September 2025).

Though we are concerned about alternative marine fuels due to high building costs and uncertainty about the dominant fuel, we are still planning newbuildings including IMO Type II bunker tankers to deliver alternative fuels to keep pace with the market.

Even so, it remains uncertain what alternative fuels will dominate the bunkering market, as most shipowners are building dual-fuel vessels enabling them to switch to conventional bunker fuels if prices are too high or when supply is limited.

MT: Can you describe the challenges Hong Lam Marine faced during IMO 2020 and how lessons learned have prepared it for upcoming IMO 2030?

The IMO 2020 Global Sulphur Cap provided a clear regulation with a definite compliance date, creating a level playing field.

However, we lack such clarity with alternative fuels; the failure of the MEPC extraordinary session in October 2025 on the net-zero framework was a setbac k. We hope for consensus next year to approve the net-zero framework and the mechanics agreed by 2028-2029, which would provide investment clarity for the bunkering industry.

To date, we have observed shipowners building dual-fuel vessels predominantly powered by methanol, some ammonia, and liquefied natural gas (LNG). Until global regulations are in place, biofuels and LNG will likely be the main transition fuels, as a lack of a level playing field impedes investment.

MT: What are your thoughts on mass flowmeters (MFM), electronic bunker delivery notes (e-BDN), and digitalisation for Singapore’s bunkering sector, and how does those set an example for marine refuelling in the rest of the world?

The best thing that ever happened to the Singapore bunkering industry is the MFM. It’s not only the MFM itself but also the whole piping system to ensure the quantity of fuel delivered is correct.

That really brought integrity to the Singapore bunkering and gave us a reputation, and it is through this reputation that allowed the local bunkering sector to thrive amongst global competition. The enforcement and compliance checks by the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) for the MFM system are also crucial to its success.

A noteworthy fact is that Hong Lam Marine test-bedded MFM with ExxonMobil and MPA from 2010 to 2016, resulting in the company operating the certified for MFM custody transfer in Singapore when MFM bunkering for fuel oil became mandatory in 2017.

The adoption of e-BDNs for Singapore’s bunkering sector was successful because the MPA listened to industry feedback. We are currently in Phase One of e-BDN, with the next phase hopefully being full digitalisation to integrate banks, suppliers, buyers, sellers, operators, and MPA, ensuring transparency and integrity when you bunker in Singapore.

MT: Based on your experience as SSA’s president from 2019 to 2025, how prepared is Singapore’s bunkering industry to tackle IMO 2030 and beyond?

Singapore is more than ready. With the involvement of Hong Lam Marine, we were the first to conduct ship-to-ship methanol bunkering and thereafter, MPA has since implemented simultaneous operations for cargo discharge and methanol bunker supply.

The Singapore bunkering sector is supported by three LNG bunker vessels, is also actively delivering bio bunker fuels, and backed by storage terminals ready for methanol and ammonia.

The MPA is proactive, and the SSA president has a seat on the MPA board, ensuring Singapore stays relevant and invests in future trends. The Singapore Maritime Academy (SMA) has trained many crew for methanol and is training for ammonia.

While Singapore is ready, the alternative fuels future resets the bunkering landscape, and we must continue to innovate to maintain our position as the world’s top bunkering port.

Singapore-headquartered crude and product tankers owner AET on Monday (10 November) said it has signed shipbuilding agreements with Samsung Heavy Industries (SHI) for the construction of two LNG dual-fuel Suezmax tankers.

The vessels will further expand AET’s growing dual-fuel fleet operating worldwide. With these orders, AET will have dual-fuel capability in all the tanker sectors it operates in – Aframaxes, Shuttle Tankers, Suezmaxes and Very Large Crude Carriers (VLCCs).

Each vessel will feature advanced technologies to enhance efficiency and environmental performance, including:

Everllence 6G70ME-C10.5-GI main engine, designed for fuel efficiency and to minimise methane-slip.

SVESSEL Intelligent Smart Ship Solution, enabling real-time monitoring and data-driven optimisation of performance and safety.

SAVER Stator-D (Duct), SARB (Rudder Bulb) and SAVER-Fins to enhance hydrodynamic efficiency and reduce fuel consumption.

Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) systems and a hybrid vertical bow design that further improve propulsion efficiency and lower emissions.

LNG is one of several alternative fuel pathways AET is pursuing, alongside ammonia and other emerging low-carbon fuels, as part of its Energy Transition Strategy. When operating on LNG, by design dual-fuel vessels can emit between 14% to 23% less greenhouse gases (GHG) on a well-to-wake basis than those using conventional marine fuels, while significantly reducing particulate matter (PM), sulphur oxides (SOₓ) and nitrogen oxides (NOₓ) .

In addition to these savings, LNG from alternative feedstocks namely bio-LNG and e-LNG offer a long-term and scalable solution to deep decarbonisation for the industry. These forms of LNG while nascent in their use as marine fuel offer significant incremental GHG emissions savings beyond (fossil) LNG based savings and utilise the same infrastructure .

Nick Potter, President & CEO of AET, said: “This marks another important step in building a more sustainable fleet and supporting our customers’ decarbonisation ambitions. With these newbuilds, our dual-fuel fleet will grow to 18 vessels , a clear demonstration of the progress we’re making in delivering more energy with less emissions.

“Through continued collaboration with industry partners, we’re investing in technologies that deliver lower-carbon energy solutions today while keeping firmly on course towards a 40% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions intensity by 2030 as part of our Energy Transition Strategy.”

The deal could give Singapore a competitive edge by plugging it directly into China’s rapidly expanding clean‑fuel production ecosystem, at a time when Beijing is emerging as the key driver of global maritime decarbonisation, according to analysts.

“The arrangement will allow Singapore to build a strong supply chain with alternative fuels and be a major supplier of biofuel, green methanol, green ammonia and maybe even liquid natural gas,” said Jason Xu, director of the Maritime Energy and Sustainable Development Centre of Excellence (MESD) at Nanyang Technological University.

The large volume of shipping traffic between both countries meant that even small shifts to green fuels or improvements in operational efficiency would lead to substantial emissions cuts, said Liu Ming, research director at MESD.

Given that Singapore is the world’s biggest bunkering hub and home to the second-busiest container port, analysts say it is no surprise that the city state is leading Southeast Asia and even the world in driving green shipping efforts.

Considering the next steps for NZF at IMO, Marinakis said he’d like to see compromise and an agreement on measures that have an immediate effect on the environment.","A panel of leading shipowners called for the International Maritime Organization (IMO) to take a pragmatic approach to regulating the shipping industry’s greenhouse gas emissions, warning that there would be global economic consequences for getting it wrong.

Speaking at the Capital Link Maritime Forum in Dubai, Eng. Ahmed Ali Alsubaey, CEO & board member, Bahri Group, said shipping’s own pragmatism was good for the environment and the world as a whole. The IMO should take a similarly practical approach, as global industry would screech to a halt if shipping took a wrong step in its energy transition, he said.

“The shipping industry, you don't know how powerful you are. When we sneeze, the rest of the industries get a cold. We've seen it,” he said. Alsubaey listed the pandemic, Russia-Ukraine war, and US-China trade war as examples of how disruption to shipping has rippling global effects that reach the man and woman on the street.

Lois Zabrocky, CEO, International Seaways Inc., said she believes that the shipping industry is pragmatic, and that it will decarbonise, although the practicalities may take longer than “the dreamers” want. Shipowners face a challenge in making considered investments — close to $150m for a dual-fuel LNG VLCC out of South Korea — on environmental credentials for alternative fuels that can be unclear and are shifting.

George Prokopiou, founder, dynacom tankers management, said that fuel-ready notations for vessels are a marketing tool. “What we do as ship owners, we are ordering the best available ships at the given moment. We don't go and say, ‘give me a model that is 10 years old’.”

Shipowners have taken risks in ordering more efficient tonnage with less proven technologies such as new engines, said Prokopiou, and that had resulted in modern tonnage with 30-35% lower fuel consumption for the same cargo. Ship efficiency is a rare place where shipowners and green organisations are aligned, he said, as fuel is a major cost in ship operations, and owners want to keep costs low.

Alsubaey agreed, saying the industry bears no resemblance to how it was in the 1960s, especially when it comes to fuel and engines. “The two major industries that have done something about the environment are the energy sector and the designers of [engines]. These two groups, over the last 30-40 years, have really transformed what we do,” he said.

The panel were less optimistic about the transformational potential of the IMO’s Net Zero Framework (NZF), which was recently delayed at a meeting of the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC).

Prokopiou said he believes there is a fundamental problem with a lack of clarity on the distribution of funds raised under the proposed rules, and that the IMO is set up as a regulator, not a tax collector. He had clear reservations on timescale and ambition too: “When you penalise somebody for not using fuels that don't exist, it's absurd,” he said.

Evangelos Marinakis, founder and chairman, Capital Maritime & Trading Corp quipped that paying a levy on fuel to governments in Europe was a roundabout way of tackling the issue at hand. “We don't solve the problem for our environment. It’s like you pay someone and you die happier, it doesn't make sense.”

Marinakis compared carbon taxation unfavourably to a more familiar strategy used in shipping.

“With slow steaming, there is a result. There are less emissions, and the only thing that is increasing is the time of transportation. But at the end of the day, you see a result that helps the environment.”

Far from cutting costs, suezmaxes cost around $70m - $80m, and for the lifespan of a newly-delivered vessel there is the prospect of paying penalties of up to $240m under NZF, claimed Prokopiou. No shipowner can foot such a bill, he said, and the cost would ultimately fall to consumers and drive up inflation and poverty.

Prokopiou suggested that shipowners and operators are the wrong target for regulation. “We are not the engine builder, not the shipyard. We are the taxi drivers. We are the users… We are not the fuel makers, the refineries and the energy companies are.”

On the challenge of alternative fuel infrastructure, Prokopiou said shipping needs two fuel suppliers in each port, “because if you have one supplier, he'll screw you on the price”. Once that distribution system is in place, shipowners will use it but it is not their job to build it. “We buy whatever is the best available,” he said.

Alsubaey raised the issue of environmental regulation with unintended consequences, noting one impact of the drive to lower sulphur content in marine fuels. “I never liked those open ended scrubbers. I thought it's a joke. If anybody thinks we're doing this for the environment, I don't know what science they have been reading, to take pollution from the air and put it in the sea and get it into the food cycle.”

“The reason we're doing it… [is] because it makes economic sense, not because it makes environmental sense. I hope that we don't get [decarbonisation] regulation that, on the face of it, looks environmental, but actually it is more harmful to the environment,” said Alsubaey.

Considering the next steps for NZF at IMO, Marinakis said he’d like to see compromise and an agreement on measures that have an immediate effect on the environment. “We have a year in front of us, at least, to make some constructive discussion and find the solution.”

Alsubaey said: “I'm hoping that the next time IMO meets, they will come up with something pragmatic, something possible, something we can do so we can truly, truly show our love for this blue planet.”

Prokopiou echoed the sentiment: “We are a family company. We try for the best. We care for our children and our grandchildren, to live in a better environment, but we go with the possible, not the desirable.”

Despite the issues raised with the NZF, the panel were responsible for sizable investments in greener tonnage. Marinakis said a significant premium was paid to order more than 30 vessels as dual-fuel LNG, but the business case made sense, as well as the environmental benefits.

“When the market on LNG is stabilised, and the new production comes in, the price of LNG will be lower, and of course, it will make sense to consume LNG irrespective of the reduction in emissions,” said Marinakis.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltdcfe6aab5515629e/bltc0ce67da76e6678c/6916783aabd3a493e0c9b61b/Capital-Link-Dubai-2025-Panel_credit-Emma-Howell.jpeg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-11-13 20:56:52.527732

However, Emma Fenton, Senior Director of Climate Diplomacy at the NGO Opportunity Green, believes that LNG stalls shipping’s clean energy transition.
The use of LNG therefore has serious and adverse effects for the climate, potentially outweighing those of conventional fuel oils.
“LNG supply chains and engine technologies are increasingly robust and established, reducing the fuel’s well-to-wake emissions.
For Madadh MacLaine Secretary-General Zero Emissions Ship Technology Association, the IMO delay has created uncertainty on process but not on direction.","The October delay at IMO of its Net Zero Framework continues to spark debate, and enthusiasm, about net zero fuel choices, including what LNG’s role should be.

Debate is expected to continue too, as shipowners face a more complicated regulatory landscape now. Despite the uncertainty created by the delay, regulations continue to force emissions reductions, including existing IMO regulations such as CII and regional regulation such as FuelEU.

With the number of dual-fuel LNG ships being ordered higher than methanol or ammonia alternatives, interest in the pathway from fossil LNG to biomethane and e-LNG is growing.

However, Emma Fenton, Senior Director of Climate Diplomacy at the NGO Opportunity Green, believes that LNG stalls shipping’s clean energy transition. “Methane is a potent GHG with climate impacts over 80 times those of CO2 over a 20-year period, and burning LNG on ships results in significant amounts of unburned methane being released into the atmosphere.

“This means that any moderate CO2 emissions savings from LNG are likely offset by methane slippage at the point of combustion and leakage across the supply chain. The use of LNG therefore has serious and adverse effects for the climate, potentially outweighing those of conventional fuel oils.

“For this reason, LNG should have a very limited role in the marine transition, and it is therefore likely that investments in LNG infrastructure will lead to stranded assets and sunk costs.”

In contrast, Steve Esau COO of SEA-LNG, says the role of LNG remains the only practical and realistic future fuel available at scale, which reduces both GHG and local air pollution from deep-sea shipping.

“The methane decarbonization pathway through liquefied biomethane and e-methane is the most viable and low risk pathway for the global maritime industry, as demonstrated by the rapid growth in the LNG dual-fuel fleet and new build orderbook. With industry initiatives dramatically reducing levels of methane emissions onboard and in fuel supply chains, the growing availability of biomethane and gradual introduction of e-methane in the coming years, the pathway will continue to deliver meaningful reductions of greenhouse gases and local emissions to the citizens of the world.”

Caspar Gooren, Commercial Director Renewable Fuels, Titan Clean Fuels, points out that details such as fuel default emissions factors are still to be decided at the IMO. “Looking beyond hypothetical scenarios, what we can say is LNG offers immediate emissions reductions and a realistic pathway via liquefied biomethane and then e-methane. It is vital that all regulations create a level playing field for alternative fuel pathways and that LNG is fairly represented.

“In fact, a recent report by Rystad Energy commissioned by SEA-LNG using actual certified emissions from LNG marine fuel supply chains found that the 2024 average global well-to-tank emissions intensity was 13.9g CO2e/MJ (LHV) – lower than the FuelEU Maritime well-to-tank default of 18.5 gCO2e/MJ.”

Regardless of the postponement, those following the LNG pathway will still make progress. “LNG supply chains and engine technologies are increasingly robust and established, reducing the fuel’s well-to-wake emissions. Meanwhile, biomethane continues to prove itself as the only readily available and competitively priced green marine fuel,” says Gooren.

Development of alternatives continues. For Madadh MacLaine Secretary-General Zero Emissions Ship Technology Association, the IMO delay has created uncertainty on process but not on direction. “Across the sector, projects are moving ahead: wind-assisted vessels under sail, hydrogen and battery systems ramping up in number and size, while serious capital is piling into clean tech and maritime infrastructure. What remains in question is not whether transition will happen, but how we ensure it is real: science-based, verifiable, and free from creative accounting.”

Joe Bettles, Climate Policy & Analysis Manager, at the Maersk McInney Centre for Zero Carbon Shipping, sums up the situation for shipowners: “There was strong support for the IMO Net Zero Framework from industry organizations who represent a significant share of the world’s shipowners and operators. These organizations want clarity and certainty. They want to see one set of global rules to be able to make business decisions. Many of those decisions are now on pause, waiting for the outcome of next year’s meeting.”",https://images.marinelink.com/images/maritime/w800/markgusev-adobe-165503.jpeg,N,,2025-11-13 19:56:14.279755

As diplomats meet in Brazil for the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP30), global resolve to tackle the climate challenge appears badly frayed. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer remarked at the beginning of the conference that global “consensus is gone” to confront the issue, with some countries stepping away from climate diplomacy and others engaging in campaigns to block the implementation of emission reduction rules. Meanwhile, recent forecasts predict a world on track for well over 2°C of global average warming—above the Paris Agreement goal to avoid the most severe impacts of climate change—with new analyses projecting the world may reach temperatures 2.6–2.8°C higher based on current policies.

With some countries adopting intimidating tactics of negotiation against climate policies and support for multilateralism ebbing, priorities among countries are largely recalibrating away from emission reductions toward the more traditional interest of security. Alongside the likely overshoot of the Paris Agreement’s temperature goal and growing intensity of climate impacts, contestation over climate politics is becoming more disruptive, particularly in venues external to historic climate negotiations of the COP process. This year may mark the beginning of a new, more unruly era in global climate politics.

Fracturing Consensus

At prior climate conferences, implementation of the Paris Agreement seemed sturdy if not swift, producing many markers of success since the agreement’s adoption 10 years ago: countries have ratcheted up emission reduction pledges; climate finance has been mobilized; and global carbon intensity of GDP has fallen, even as emissions continue to rise. A surge of enhanced national commitments strengthened momentum for climate mitigation at 2021’s COP26 in Glasgow, and leaders agreed to “transition away from fossil fuels” and speed ambition across sectors at 2023’s COP28 in Dubai. But now, even COP29’s signature agreement—a new climate finance target of $1.3 trillion annually by 2035, with at least $300 billion in public finance to come from developed countries—looks imperiled, despite being agreed to just 12 months ago, due to tightening national fiscal space and shrinking foreign assistance budgets.

These developments come against a backdrop of great power tensions that threaten the foundations of the entire multilateral system, many of which are rearing their head in global climate politics. For example, inflamed rhetoric this year has flouted norms underpinning the World Trade Organization, the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, the Refugee Convention, the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention, the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, and the UN Charter’s recognized right to territorial integrity. Member states have separately accused three permanent members of the UN Security Council—China, Russia, and the United States—of illegal use of military aggression against their neighbors. These security issues are getting more airtime with each successive COP meeting, as topics like military emissions from the conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine get increasing scrutiny, and as territorial disputes boil over into COP processes.

Meanwhile, the UN faces a historic budget shortfall and is warning of a “race to bankruptcy,” with major powers failing to contribute their annual payments to the organization. With the US now joining the BRICS group of 11 countries in harsh critiques of the international system, attracting further contributions to fortify the work of international institutions appears bleak. “The post-war global order is not just obsolete, it is now a weapon being used against us,” declared US Secretary of State Marco Rubio earlier this year, reflecting the Trump administration’s intention to undermine many of the institutions the US helped establish over the past 80 years.

Bullish Petrostates

As the US federal government now vehemently opposes efforts to combat global climate change, its approach has revealed fresh hostility to differing global views. US negotiators to the International Maritime Organization (IMO), for example, displayed new tactics of intimidation in October to scuttle multilateral efforts to limit emissions from the shipping sector. The “Net-Zero Framework” had been provisionally agreed to by governments after years of negotiation, had wide backing of industry, and would have introduced a carbon pricing mechanism on shipping emissions to take effect in 2028. Decrying the effort as a “neocolonial export of global climate regulations,” the US State Department put governments “on notice” that it would not just change its position and oppose the measure but also inflict consequences on countries that supported the framework’s adoption. Those pressures increased with the direct involvement of President Donald Trump to include threatening sanctions or the revocation of visas of individual negotiators and members of the IMO Secretariat, and ultimately led to a postponement of the vote until next year.

But it’s not just the United States that is displaying new resolve to stymie countries with ambitious climate policies or block new climate action. The United Arab Emirates recently joined the Trump administration in opposing European Union legislation that would make businesses responsible for limiting their environmental impact. Earlier this year, Saudi Arabia and Russia blocked a vote within the World Health Organization to advance an action plan on climate change and health impacts, and Saudi Arabia has also pushed aggressively to prevent mention of the energy transition in at least five different global negotiations. Together, these states perceive they benefit strategically from the continued expansion of fossil fuel demand and have used bilateral and multilateral negotiations to advance these interests. Given the ability of the Trump administration to secure fossil fuel purchase agreements in its trade negotiations (even if the scale of those promises are unrealistic), fossil fuel–producing states likely feel newly unconstrained from global climate agreements, particularly with some developing countries applauding the shift back toward oil and gas.

More Discord Brewing

As some countries backtrack from climate deals, others are using new tactics outside of the COP process to confront the global climate challenge head-on. Foremost is the growing trend to seek legal damages for the impacts of climate change. Over 30 states and municipalities in the United States have brought suits against fossil fuel companies alleging damages, with Hawaii being the latest after the devastating Maui fires. The European Court of Human Rights recently ruled that countries taking insufficient action against climate change are violating human rights, and similar rulings have come down from the Inter-American Court of Human Rights and the Law of the Sea Tribunal. In July 2025, the International Court of Justice built on these cases and ruled on the side of the small-island state Vanuatu, finding that states are bound under international law to prevent climate change. While international bodies have little ability to enforce their rulings, they give additional leverage to those seeking financial reparations from the losses and damages they face, whether from private companies or governments.

And without a dedicated negotiation stream to discuss trade issues in the formal COP process, countries are increasingly flouting established international trade rules for climate and economic purposes, using subsidies and tariffs to reward energy technologies—both clean and fossil fuels. This has contributed to a more fractured global landscape of robust industrial policies. Participants of a recent series of dialogues convened by CGEP on climate and trade found that climate–trade conflicts could increasingly create obstacles to trade and to countries’ climate and economic ambitions.

Finally, with climate forecasts pointing to decades of warming, more intense global impacts, and the potential for crossing “tipping points” in the Earth’s systems, proposals for local or global geoengineering programs—such as marine cloud brightening over the Great Barrier Reef or global solar radiation management—are gaining steam. Discussion of this topic has been mostly absent from the COP climate negotiation process, leading it to pop up in several other fora including the Montreal Protocol, the London Protocol, and the UN Environmental Assembly, among others. However, with private parties signaling interest in unilateral deployment while some activists are pushing for a total ban on climate intervention technologies, global debate has only just begun on a potentially more divisive issue than even global emissions reductions and climate finance has been.

Governments have come together at COP30 seemingly with less uniting them than ever, and with more friction likely ahead. These are the tough realities that the global community must contend with, not just at COP30 but as it looks to chart a new future for governance in a climate changing world.",https://www.energypolicy.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Image_COP30-and-Beyond-The-Implications-of-a-New-Era-of-Discord-in-Global-Climate-Politics.png,N,,2025-11-13 14:56:53.097238

Since the entry into force of the EU Regulation on the use of renewable and low-carbon fuels in maritime transport, also known as FuelEU Maritime, shipping companies such as TT-Line are required to comply with binding limits for the greenhouse gas intensity of the energy used on board. The regulation applies to all ships in the EU with a gross tonnage of more than 5,000 in commercial passenger or freight transport, regardless of the flag they fly.

This rule will also continue to apply until further notice. The International Maritime Organization – IMO for short – only recently postponed its decision on a global climate regime for shipping, the so-called “Net Zero Framework,” by one year. The framework would, for the first time, have introduced a global CO₂ price for an industrial sector and set the roadmap for the industry’s climate neutrality by 2050.

“Our Peter Pan, together with her sister ship Nils Holgersson, is the largest LNG-powered Ro-Pax ferry in the world. These ferries represent far more to us than merely meeting legal requirements; we are preparing ourselves and our fleet as well as possible for a sustainable future.

TT-Line connects the German Baltic Sea ports of Travemünde and Rostock as well as the ports of Świnoujście in Poland and Klaipėda in Lithuania with the southern Swedish transport hubs of Trelleborg – Sweden’s largest ferry port – and, since April 2023, Karlshamn. Its transport performance amounts annually to approx. 1 million passengers, 250,000 cars and approx. 500,000 freight units. TT-Line is therefore the market leader in traffic to southern Sweden.

The bio-LNG produced by EnviTec Biogas reduces emissions by up to 100% compared to marine diesel and thus provides shipping companies with a better starting point with regard to the targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions under the FuelEU Maritime Regulation.",https://www.renewableenergymagazine.com/ficheroenergias/fotos/agenda/ampliada/b/biofuelgermany.jpg,N,,2025-11-13 10:57:06.885547
