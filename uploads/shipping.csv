James Helliwell, commercial director for decarbonisation at V, said: “The IMO’s decision to delay the Net Zero Framework for a year marks a profound setback for global shipping decarbonisation.
The delay - and potential abandonment - of unified global measures opens the door to a patchwork of regional carbon schemes.
One segment of the maritime industry which was particularly seeking clarification over the Net Zero Framework was LNG suppliers/users.
Again, SEA-LNG see the outcome of the IMO meeting in a more positive light than others.","Richard Berkling, CEO of PowerCell Group, was cautiously optimistic about the setback, he said: “The IMO’s decision at the recent extraordinary MEPC to postpone adoption of the Net Zero Framework by one year is a setback for the maritime sector, but not a defeat. The pause underscores the need for persistence and verifiable proof that zero-emission technologies are practical, competitive, and reliable in operation.”

He went on to say that during this delay its imperative that industry has to deliver tangible projects with verifiable performance data to persuade hesitant stakeholders including shipowners, fleet operators and the all important investors.

“The future will be shaped by pioneers who lead, project by project,” he added.

Others aren’t nearly as optimistic as PowerCell’s Berkling. James Helliwell, commercial director for decarbonisation at V, said: “The IMO’s decision to delay the Net Zero Framework for a year marks a profound setback for global shipping decarbonisation. The delay - and potential abandonment - of unified global measures opens the door to a patchwork of regional carbon schemes. This means shipowners may face multiple, overlapping carbon taxes for the same emissions whilst navigating inconsistent regional standards without the level playing field that IMO measures would have provided.”

I alluded to the issues of having regional regulations as opposed to a global standard but Helliwell has explained the problems the lack of an IMO framework presents succinctly.

He does imply that there are green shots of optimism despite the setback, stating: “The industry’s decarbonisation imperative hasn’t disappeared; it has simply become more complex and costly. The 2023 IMO GHG Strategy targets remain, even as the pathway to achieving them becomes increasingly unclear.”

He went on to say that given the outcome ship managers will now play an essential role in helping companies navigate what will inevitably become a more fragmented regulatory landscape. He points to his own company V.’s integrated ship management platform, which includes performance optimisation tools and decarbonisation initiatives, that will aid owners and operators in meeting what may be fragmented requirements whilst maintaining operational efficiency and commercial competitiveness.

One segment of the maritime industry which was particularly seeking clarification over the Net Zero Framework was LNG suppliers/users. The industry body representing that fuel, SEA-LNG, said it will use the delay time to work with its members and other industry organizations to continue to develop meaningful, scientific studies to support the IMO’s critical work.

Again, SEA-LNG see the outcome of the IMO meeting in a more positive light than others. It stated: “The industry will continue on the road to decarbonisation. The methane pathway is currently the only practical, realistic and scalable solution to the decarbonisation of the global maritime industry, as demonstrated by the rapid growth in the LNG dual-fuel fleet and new build orderbook.”

The group pointed to the work done by engine manufacturers to reduce methane slip as well as the growing availability of biomethane and gradual introduction of e-methane as evidence that LNG has a longer lifespan than those who dismiss it as a fossil fuel would suggest.

It said in a statement: “the pathway [to Net Zero] will continue to deliver meaningful reductions of greenhouse gases and local emissions to the citizens of the world.”",https://d3f3h35mrzf979.cloudfront.net/Pictures/1024x536/6/1/9/333619_steveessau_231248.jpeg,N,,2025-10-27 14:00:00.770381

The appointment comes as ABS Group has been recognized by Forbes Magazine as one of the world’s best management consulting firms for two consecutive years.

“ABS Group is a recognized safety leader with world class capabilities in process safety, risk management and asset performance management,” Wechsler said. “This is a great foundation to build on. I am proud to lead their incredible team and support their mission to improve performance and reduce risk in a changing world.”

The leadership change follows Wiernicki’s announcement in April that he would retire at the end of 2025 after a 14-year tenure as Chairman and CEO of the American Bureau of Shipping. Under his leadership, ABS achieved substantial growth in 2024, with its fleet expanding to 300 million gross tons while maintaining a 22 percent global new order share.

Current ABS President and Chief Operating Officer John McDonald is expected to assume the role of Chairman and CEO starting January 1, 2026, pending Board of Directors approval.

During his tenure, Wiernicki navigated the organization through challenges including the pandemic, the marine and offshore industry downturn, and technology and regulatory changes. “In spite of these events, we were able to move forward with a number of strategic investments that have allowed us to become an industry recognized technology and safety leader,” Wiernicki stated.

In September, at London International Shipping Week 2025, Wiernicki underscored the human element in maritime operations. “Behind every smart ship, every digital dashboard, and every data stream, there is still a human being making critical decisions,” he said. “Investment in their training and continuous development is essential. It is not just about efficiency, it’s about dignity, safety, and long-term resilience.”

Wiernicki has been vocal about the maritime industry’s regulatory challenges, particularly regarding the IMO Net Zero Framework. “Shipping and the IMO are on different trajectories,” he stated at the launch of the 2025 ABS Sustainability Outlook. “There is no clear pathway for green fuel availability and scalability and infrastructure support. The industry needs a framework but we need one that marries ambition with reality.”

Riviera’s LNG Shipping and Terminals Conference returns to London in November 2026.","LNG remains a robust long-term pillar of energy security, offering unprecedented opportunity across the value chain, delegates at this year’s LNG Shipping and Terminals Conference heard.

Substantial and accelerated growth in LNG supply was forecast, expected to trigger the lower prices needed to stimulate new demand, particularly across emerging Asian economies. Lower LNG prices are also driving growth in the FSRU market, creating new opportunities to convert older LNG carriers into FSRU or FSU units.

The solid orderbook extending to 2028 reflects deep confidence in future demand. Fleet renewal is being driven by proactive responses to regulatory change, turning compliance mandates into strategic modernisation opportunities. Key discussions centred on how to navigate the complexities of the EU ETS, FuelEU Maritime and IMO’s Net-Zero Framework to future-proof assets.

BioLNG was recognised as the most cost-effective option for meeting immediate FuelEU requirements, providing a practical pathway to decarbonise fleets. Delegates also examined continuous emissions monitoring systems, which can deliver immediate EU ETS cost savings through more accurate data. Further optimisation is being achieved via AI and virtualisation in route and terminal operations, while wind-assisted propulsion systems, such as rotor sails, are achieving estimated fuel savings of 5–7 tonnes a day on LNG carriers.

Methane slip, which varies widely by engine type and load condition, is prompting manufacturers to guarantee engine performance and accelerate the development of abatement technologies. Solutions under consideration include converting existing engines to spark-ignited gas systems to reduce slip immediately. At the same time, concerns around LNG heavies, the heavier, long-chain hydrocarbons (C6+ compounds) present in LNG cargoes, highlighted the need to standardise testing protocols and address legal gaps in charter parties related to cargo quality. There was also considerable interest in a new approach for safer, simpler, smarter LNG transfer put forward by Trelleborg, built around tighter training, better data and smarter co-operation.

As always, the conference delivered valuable networking opportunities, including a lively drinks reception and dinner. Attendees gave high marks to the conference app, which enabled networking, access to presentations, and live participation in Q&A sessions. Some 267 questions were submitted over the two days.

On this symbolic day, the UK reminded departing delegates that the IMO stands as a testament to what nations can achieve together. The Chair, Sveinung Oftedal, closed the meeting by reminding Member States that they are united by a shared cause, rooted in expertise and mutual respect.

We have a year – time that can be used to strengthen, align, and advocate for a robust global framework. The Center will use this year to continue our support for the development of guidelines, to broaden consensus, and to maintain industry momentum toward a global framework that can provide certainty, incentives, and a just transition.

According to MMMCZCS, though the Net-Zero Framework (NZF) was not adopted, the Chair reassured delegates that real progress was made and that the next intersessional will go further still. While the decision to postpone by one year was not the outcome that was hoped for, it is far from defeat for decarbonization.

The NZF was built upon the 2023 IMO GHG Strategy, which was unanimously adopted in 2023 and was approved by an overwhelming majority back in April. The NZF remains a sound market-based policy, broadly supported by industry, that can provide the needed certainty of a single global framework, while supporting a just transition for developing countries.

In an exclusive interview to SAFETY4SEA, Kasper Møller Nielsen, Sustainability Partner at Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller Center for Zero Carbon Shipping, emphasized that collaboration is essential to addressing the challenges of the transition.

Furthermore, developing the comprehensive guidelines necessary to implement a framework of this scale was always going to be a daunting task. The coming year provides time to make sure that these guidelines are robust and that more countries can be confident in supporting adoption. The productive intersessional discussions on guidelines following the extraordinary MEPC showed that constructive dialogue remains at the heart of the IMO.

Commitment to decarbonization will continue to shape the industry – especially with existing regional and national measures supporting the business case for sustainable investments. Postponement does not change the need to invest, experiment, learn, and begin to scale solutions that reduce emissions, MMMCZCS explained.

Over the next year, the Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller Center for Zero Carbon Shipping underlines its support IMO Member States in developing effective guidelines, provide clarity to the industry where possible, and engage in global dialogue to address concerns. The process will be challenging, but the Center remains committed to fostering collaboration among Member States and the maritime sector to enable the adoption of the NZF.

We are disappointed with the decision to postpone this crucial meeting by one year. The effects of climate change do not wait, and our dedication and work continue stronger than ever. We appreciate the leadership of many Member States in the room and stand ready to continue our work to support the IMO.

That’s not a distance problem – that’s a consistency problem. Voyage-level visibility turns those hidden differences into actionable insight for shippers and forwarders

… Eduardo Ramos, Senior Data Analyst at OceanScore, added that short-sea operations are less predictable than long-haul ones, with every delay or underutilized sailing compounding emissions and cost exposure.

Carrier consistency: The new benchmark for Scope 3 efficiency

Carrier selection therefore plays a decisive role on feeder-dominated routes. Opting for high-volume, lower-intensity operators can materially reduce Scope 3 exposure, while reliance on volatile feeders risks inflated totals.

Carriers with narrower, more stable distributions offer predictable Scope 3 outcomes, whereas those with wider spreads increase reporting uncertainty and cost pass-through risk.

“Consistency is the new benchmark,” said Smith. “You can’t control if a ship sails full or half-empty – but you can choose carriers who operate predictably and efficiently.”

Key Area Data Point Takeaway Variability 9–80 gCO₂/t-km range (10× gap) Operational consistency drives efficiency, not ship size. Feeder Impact 40–60 gCO₂/t-km vs 7–16 for larger ships Feeder volatility inflates Scope 3 totals. Delays 9.3 → 38.1 gCO₂/t-km (2-day idle) A single port delay can quadruple emissions. Carrier Performance Arkas (17.8), MSC (20.3), Maersk (19.8), CMA (24.0), X-Press (30.3), Boluda (30.1) Consistency matters more than size or distance. Utilization & Speed 70% load = 20–30% less CO₂; +1 knot = +5% CO₂ Steady utilization and speed discipline are key reduction levers for Scope 3 emissions. Reporting Accuracy EU ETS & FuelEU make averages obsolete Voyage-level data prevents cost overstatement.

Utilization drives efficiency and predictability

OceanScore data reveals that most voyages operate between 37–67% utilization, with higher load factors strongly correlating with lower carbon intensity per tonne. CMA CGM records the highest proportion of heavily loaded voyages (52–72%), MSC shows wider variability, and Maersk maintains the most balanced performance, clustering between 57–67%.

A vessel operating at 70% utilization emits roughly 20–30% less CO₂ per tonne-kilometre than one at 50%. Across the corridor, MSC generally shows better efficiency, CMA CGM higher average intensity, and Maersk steady mid-range performance.

Ahead of next week’s session of the Nordic Council, the Clean Arctic Alliance today called on Nordic governments to adopt a resolution on polar fuels during the meeting, and together commit to support an International Maritime Organization (IMO) regulation that would require cleaner maritime fuels, which would result in lower emissions of black carbon by ships when operating in the Arctic.

The deadline for concrete proposals for such a regulation to be submitted to the thirteenth session of the IMO’s technical committee that addresses pollution prevention and response (PPR13, February 2026) is December 5th.

“Ahead of a crucial meeting of the IMO next February, the Clean Arctic Alliance is calling for the Member States of the International Maritime Organization to develop and adopt a mandatory regulation which would require that only polar fuels can be used by shipping in the Arctic”, said Dr Sian Prior, Lead Advisorto the Clean Arctic Alliance. “A resolution on polar fuels adopted by Nordic governments next week would send a strong message to IMO Member States that action is urgently needed to protect the Arctic from the impacts of shipping emissions.”

“Black carbon is a climate superpollutant produced when fossil fuels are burned”, said Prior. “Black carbon has a disproportionate impact because it both heats the atmosphere – and when released from ship exhausts and when near to the Arctic it settles onto snow and ice, speeding up the melting and exposing darker land and sea beneath, which continue to absorb more heat. It is the loss of the planet’s reflectivity – or albedo – which is contributing to the fast pace of warming seen in the Arctic.”

“Black carbon emissions from ships burning oil-based fuels have more than doubled in the last decade, yet a simple and easy solution is to require shipping to use widely available distillate fuels with lower black carbon emissions when operating in and near to the Arctic”, said Prior.

About Black Carbon, Polar Fuels, and the Arctic

Black carbon is a short-lived climate pollutant, produced by the incomplete burning of fossil fuels, with an impact more than three thousand times that of CO2 over a 20 year period. It makes up around one-fifth of international shipping’s climate impact. Not only does it contribute to warming while in the atmosphere, black carbon accelerates melting if deposited onto snow and ice – hence it has a disproportionate impact when released in and near to the Arctic.

The melting snow and ice exposes darker areas of land and water and these dark patches then absorb further heat from the sun and the reflective capacity of the planet’s polar ice caps is severely reduced. More heat in the polar systems – results in increased melting. This is the loss of the albedo effect.

Declines in sea ice extent and volume are leading to a burgeoning social and environmental crisis in the Arctic, while cascading changes are impacting global climate and ocean circulation. Scientists have high confidence that processesare nearing points beyond which rapid and irreversible changes on the scale of multiple human generations are possible. Scientists say it is now too late to save summer Arctic sea ice, and research has shown that “preparations need to be made for the increased extreme weather across the northern hemisphere that is likely to occur as a result.”

Black carbon also has a negative impact on human health including premature death and harmful effects on the cardiovascular system (heart, blood and blood vessels), and recent research has found black carbon particles in the body tissues of foetuses, following inhalation by pregnant mothers.

The need to reduce emissions of black carbon because of both the climate and health impacts has been long recognised. On land, considerable effort has been made to ban dirtier fuels in power stations, to install diesel particulate filters on land-based transport, and to improve the burning of dry wood – all to reduce emissions of black carbon and improve air quality. However, at sea the same efforts have not yet been made.",https://cyprusshippingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/New-Project-5-3.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 13:00:32.890776

It also shouldn’t tolerate the EU’s carbon tax on goods.
The IMO’s proposed global carbon tax should be a wake-up call to the U.N.-EU attempt to impose a sweeping radical climate agenda on all countries.","The United States should take necessary action to kill off the IMO global carbon tax.

T he United States should be an international leader in the fight against energy poverty and for energy freedom.

Because, as of now, many countries are using their power through international bodies to impose their harmful, anti-energy climate agenda on countries who don’t share their ideological objectives.

This problem has recently been highlighted by the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) proposed global carbon tax on the shipping industry. Until just a few days ago the IMO, a specialized agency of the United Nations, was set to impose its “Net-Zero Framework,” what is in effect a tax on carbon dioxide emissions from ships that exceed certain thresholds to be paid for by shipping companies. The IMO would have collected the revenue and then distributed it for such things as rewarding “low-emission ships” and for U.N. income redistribution schemes to “mitigate negative [climate] impacts on vulnerable States.”

This tax is especially egregious because it is a violation of the sovereignty of the U.S. and other nations. A U.N. international body would be imposing a tax on Americans, something that appears to be a first. The tax, according to the State Department, could increase global shipping costs by 10 percent or more.

It’s also yet another example of Europe and the U.N. trying to dictate the domestic climate policies of other countries. The State Department made it clear that it understood the fundamental problem this posed when it stated that the U.S. would penalize nations “that sponsor this European-led neocolonial export of global climate regulations.”

Fortunately, the Trump administration helped to delay a vote on the IMO tax plan for a year, but it is still looming. A tax delayed is not a tax canceled.

The IMO tax, though, is far from the only effort to impose climate policies on other countries. This past July, the U.N.’s top court, the International Court of Justice, issued a nonbinding advisory opinion that reads more like a climate manifesto than an example of logical legal reasoning. It concluded that member states have a duty to reduce and regulate greenhouse gas emissions.

It also stated the “failure of a State to take appropriate action to protect the climate system from GHG [Greenhouse Gas] emissions — including through fossil fuel production, fossil fuel consumption, the granting of fossil fuel exploration licenses or the provision of fossil fuel subsidies — may constitute an internationally wrongful act which is attributable to that State.”

While a nonbinding opinion, there is a very real possibility that this opinion will be used in various ways to justify greenhouse gas regulation in policy contexts across the world, as well as in litigation in other jurisdictions.

Then there’s the European Union’s carbon border adjustment mechanism, which is in effect a carbon tax imposed on goods based on their carbon intensity (i.e. how much carbon dioxide is emitted during production). The EU’s reason for the tax is clear: “to encourage cleaner industrial production in non-EU countries.”

Once again, here’s that “European-led neocolonial export of global climate regulations.” The EU isn’t imposing a tax based on the specific attributes of a good itself. Instead, it’s trying to use trade to influence and change the climate policies and production methods of other countries, in part to protect what remains of European industries as decarbonization bites.

It isn’t enough that EU nations have adopted harmful policies that punish energy use and increase prices for their own citizens. They need to make sure other countries hurt themselves too, including developing countries that need fossil fuels to advance the well-being of their citizens.

The world can go down a misguided path of restricting energy to address climate change. Or nations can collaborate to unleash energy, innovation, and abundance to improve the lives of individuals today while also being in a much better position to address any real environmental challenges that arise, including any connected to climate change.

The United States should certainly take whatever action is needed to kill the IMO global carbon tax as well as the climate hysteria that is engrained right now in almost all of the work of the U.N. It also shouldn’t tolerate the EU’s carbon tax on goods.

But our country can’t just be on defense, we need to be on offense, too. This requires leading nations in an effort to reject climate extremism and to help solve energy poverty by allowing countries to use energy as they deem fit to meet their own objectives.

There are around 750 million people in the world without electricity. According to the World Bank, there are about 2 billion people “without access to safely managed drinking water services.” There are also about 700 million people who live in extreme poverty, defined as surviving on less than $2.15 per day.

Developing countries have more important issues to worry about than climate change. Getting rid of affordable and reliable energy isn’t just unjustified, it is, given the struggles of so many of their people, immoral. And the need for affordable and reliable energy is certainly not limited to developing countries. It’s a necessity for all nations.

The IMO’s proposed global carbon tax should be a wake-up call to the U.N.-EU attempt to impose a sweeping radical climate agenda on all countries.",,N,,2025-10-27 13:00:45.156120

Redefining the Green Corridor Sommadossi said the events of the past week should also trigger a broader rethink of what constitutes a truly green shipping corridor.
The future of green shipping will be built, not negotiated.”","Member States of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) have voted to delay for one year the adoption of draft amendments to MARPOL Annex VI, which would have created the world’s first truly global carbon-pricing mechanism for shipping. The decision, taken at the second extraordinary session of the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC/ES.2) held in London from 14–17 October 2025, marks a setback for international decarbonization efforts, in favor of a status quo that benefit oil and gas producers but not shipowners, investors and ports already under pressure to meet tightening emissions targets.

The postponement leaves the sector without a formal global market framework just as regional regulation is gathering pace, from Europe’s maritime carbon pricing to new clean-port standards in Asia and North America. NatPower Marine said the outcome underlines the growing gap between political negotiation and industry action, as ports and shipping lines continue to invest in clean-energy infrastructure despite the lack of a global mechanism.

Stefano D.M. Sommadossi, CEO of NatPower Marine and NatPower UK, said: “While the IMO’s postponement is disappointing, it cannot be a pause button for the industry. Shore power and near-shore electrification are proven, scalable and capable of delivering deep emissions cuts today. Every corridor we electrify removes thousands of tons of CO2, NOx and SOx from the system while improving air quality for coastal communities. The opportunity to lead is now, not in a year’s time.”

He continued: “No sector has got regulation before innovation, it has always been the other way round. Airplanes, cars, radio, Internet, AI were invented and adopted before regulation, and regulation followed the path set by innovators.

It is clear that the larger players and most innovative shipping operators and owners have already decided to go green because it is a strategic advantage and a cost cutting option in the years to come. So innovators and initiators will progress during this regulatory postponement. We at NatPower are accelerating our plan to deliver near shore electric propulsion and cold ironing in 120 locations globally.”

The potential losers of this postponement are the emerging countries that were relying on IMO global carbon pricing to finance investments. The good news is that those investments can be made with private capital, provided that their locations are included in the green corridors and routes of the initiators.

New electric fuel for ships is already benefitting from the sheer convenience and it is a low hanging fruit for decarbonization, and it is happening right now. Without waiting to choose among different alternative cleaner molecules (e-methanol, ammonia and hydrogen), the immediate opportunity is near shore electric propulsions and cold ironing.

The existing regulations in EU and China, and their ambitions to become the powerhouses of Energy Transition, are more than sufficient to trigger adoption and change.

Across Europe, Asia and the Americas, a wave of electrification projects, from single-port upgrades to full Green Corridors, is building a global network of clean maritime routes. It shows what genuine international cooperation can achieve when backed by real infrastructure and investment.

Green Shipping Corridors: the model for immediate progress

Through its investment in true Green Shipping Corridors, NatPower Marine is connecting high-traffic maritime routes with clean electricity for propulsion and cold ironing, replacing fossil-fuel use both in port and on near-shore legs. The company is planning to invest more than £3 billion to deliver 120 clean-port locations by 2030, creating an integrated global network of zero-emission maritime energy hubs.

For example, the corridor between Heysham Port and Northern Ireland, developed in partnership with Peel Ports Group, has started construction. It will eliminate more than 10,000 tons of CO2 annually from Irish Sea routes and forms part of a wider £250 million UK rollout of shore-power and e-ship-charging infrastructure.

Sommadossi said: “The IMO’s delay underlines the challenge of reaching consensus at a global level. But while negotiations stall, regional regulation is accelerating, and the landscape is becoming more fragmented. The EU Emissions Trading System now prices maritime emissions, and FuelEU Maritime sets carbon-intensity limits for vessels trading in Europe. The UK is preparing to bring shipping into its own ETS, Singapore is expanding its network of green corridors, and California is already enforcing at-berth emission rules. The message is clear: decarbonization is no longer waiting for a single global mechanism, it is happening route by route, region by region.”

This patchwork of regional measures is driving urgency for practical, scalable solutions that can operate across multiple regulatory systems. As global policy tightens, the infrastructure to deliver compliance and emissions reduction is struggling to keep pace, creating both challenge and opportunity for the industry.

That urgency is echoed in new research showing the accelerating pace of green-shipping regulation and innovation worldwide.

According to the World Maritime University (WMU) and the Shanghai International Shipping Institute (SISI) in their Global Green Shipping Development Report (2024–2025), regulatory pressure on ports and shipping is now accelerating across all major economies.

The WMU/SISI report also confirms that ports are increasingly being recognized as the key enablers of maritime decarbonization, with shore power expected to become a mandatory standard in many jurisdictions. The study highlights that “ships in ports will use more shore power or zero-carbon energy in the future” as emission requirements tighten, a view strongly echoed by NatPower Marine.

“This global trend validates our approach,” said Sommadossi. “Shore power and e-charging infrastructure are not optional extras; they are the foundation for clean shipping. Every port that plugs, in our standardized network, becomes part of the global energy transition.”

Energy integration: powering the maritime transition

To ensure clean electricity is available where and when vessels need it, NatPower Marine is supported by 20 GW of renewable generation and over 100 GWh of battery-storage capacity developed by its parent, NatPower Group. Located in strategic coastal regions, these assets deliver stable, low-cost renewable power through private-wire connections and smart Power Purchase Agreements, supporting vessel charging and port operations without burdening national grids.

This integrated approach forms what Sommadossi describes as “the backbone of a clean-shipping network,” linking renewable generation directly to maritime demand and enabling real decarbonization today.

NatPower Marine believes the IMO’s delay could, paradoxically, open space for innovation and collaboration. While waiting for a global mechanism, countries, ports and fleets can lead the way and show what success looks like by developing their own clean-energy routes, projects that cut emissions while creating industrial and economic growth.

Redefining the Green Corridor

Sommadossi said the events of the past week should also trigger a broader rethink of what constitutes a truly green shipping corridor.

“So far, most green corridors have been defined around alternative fuels and fuel-supply routes,” he said. “But that only addresses part of the challenge. A true green corridor must include the full chain of clean-energy infrastructure, from shore power and propulsion charging to renewable generation and grid integration. That is the only way to deliver zero-emission voyages from berth to berth, at an affordable cost.”

He added that NatPower Marine’s approach, combining e-ship charging, port-grid integration and large-scale battery storage, offers a practical blueprint for this next generation of corridors.

“If the past week has shown anything,” he concluded, “it is that we cannot wait for definitions and policy to catch up with reality. The future of green shipping will be built, not negotiated.”",https://www.ajot.com/images/uploads/article/_large/Stefano-Sommadossi-CEO-NatPower.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 13:00:54.934057

This indicates broad support for the NZF and that progress can still be made on preparing for implementation.” The NZF is aimed at reducing GHG emissions from ships, in line with the GHG Strategy.
John Maggs, CSC’s representative at IMO, said: “IMO member states also don’t have to wait a year for the NZF to tackle shipping’s contribution to the climate crisis.
“The NZF may be delayed but the work hasn’t stopped, and when adoption comes next year, implementation can be quick.
“Scaling back ambition at this critical moment would risk slowing the momentum needed to achieve meaningful progress in maritime decarbonization.","As a meeting of the International Maritime Organization (IMO)’s Intersessional Working Group on Reduction of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions from Ships (ISWG-GHG 20) closes in London, the Clean Shipping Coalition (CSC) applauds IMO member states for rising above last week’s rancor, when the IMO decided to hold off on adoption for one year, by pushing ahead with preparations for adoption of the Net Zero Framework (NZF).

Delaine McCullough, CSC’s president, said: “While last week’s IMO decision to delay its NZF was unwelcome, let’s be clear – this is just a postponement and not the end of the NZF.

“During this week’s ISWG meeting, IMO member states have constructively engaged in preparing the guidelines that will be necessary once the NZF is adopted. This indicates broad support for the NZF and that progress can still be made on preparing for implementation.”

The NZF is aimed at reducing GHG emissions from ships, in line with the GHG Strategy. The NZF includes a global fuel standard (GFS), requiring ships “to gradually reduce how polluting its ship fuel can be (i.e., how much greenhouse gas is emitted for each unit of energy used, across a fuel’s life cycle)”. It also includes a mechanism for setting prices on the GHG ships emit, to encourage the shipping industry to lower emissions as per the global fuel standard.

John Maggs, CSC’s representative at IMO, said: “IMO member states also don’t have to wait a year for the NZF to tackle shipping’s contribution to the climate crisis. At the IMO’s MEPC 84 meeting in April 2026 they will get a chance to slash GHG emissions and the cost of the energy transition by strengthening the Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII), the IMO’s cornerstone energy efficiency measure.

“By transforming the CII into an energy efficiency powerhouse, the IMO and its member states can quickly get shipping climate action back on course.”

Dr Alison Shaw, IMO manager, Transport & Environment, said: “While adoption of the IMO NZF was paused last week, negotiations this week advanced on the implementation guidelines nonetheless.

“The framework’s success will hinge on strong, coherent guidance that both incentivizes long-term green e-fuel production and use, and safeguards against unsustainable fuels with uncaptured environmental impacts. Many member states acknowledged the importance of both aims, though uncertainty over the framework’s eventual adoption remained a clear backdrop to discussions.”

Andrew Dumbrille, co-founder and director, Equal Routes, said: “This week’s meeting signaled that IMO member states will inevitably need to account more comprehensively for not only potential environmental harms but also human, health, social, Indigenous Peoples’ rights and community well-being of the full well to wake marine fuels energy pathway.

“Despite the implementation delay of the IMO’s GHG framework, work continues in earnest to create a just and equitable path for the shipping sector to meet its 2050 net zero ambitions.”

Anaïs Rios, senior shipping policy officer, Seas At Risk, said: “Wind propulsion is back in the spotlight at the IMO this week, with countries voicing support and industry data strengthening the case.

“The NZF may be delayed but the work hasn’t stopped, and when adoption comes next year, implementation can be quick. Governments must now ensure that these guidelines enable a global scale up of wind propulsion: One of the few solutions that cuts fuel bills, slashes emissions and keeps shipping competitive. The technology is here, now the rules need to catch up.”

Jenny Helle, expert on decarbonization of aviation and shipping, Carbon Market Watch, said: “The global shift toward cleaner shipping fuels and technologies is already happening.

“Scaling back ambition at this critical moment would risk slowing the momentum needed to achieve meaningful progress in maritime decarbonization.

“This week, the IMO member states have shown support for the development of clear, enforceable, and science-based guidelines, robust life-cycle emissions accounting, a reward scheme for clean fuels and technologies, as well as revenue distribution to support the transition in small island developing states and least developed countries.”

The new IMO regulation, which would place a cost on bunker fuels’ GHG from 2028, is designed to reduce the price gap between conventional and sustainable fuels.
Vassilis Kikilias, Greece’s Minister of Shipping, said after the vote that the framework has “unfair treatment of LNG fuel” and would likely cause serious disruptions in global trade and lead to inflation.
In a recent study commissioned by SEA-LNG, Rystad Energy estimates the well-to-tank GHG intensity of LNG bunker at 13.9 grams of CO2e/megajoule in 2024, compared with 18.8 grams of CO2e/Mj in 2019.
But some industry participants said whether the IMO regulation is adopted or not could depend on geopolitics, rather than its content per se.","Fossil fuels could remain the preferred marine energy at the expense of low-carbon fuels, with the International Maritime Organization’s new decarbonization rules hanging in the balance, according to industry participants.

Supporters of the UN agency’s Net-Zero Framework were hoping the regulatory piece could kickstart the industry’s energy transition from conventional, oil-based fuels to methanol or ammonia with much lower greenhouse gas emissions intensity.

But IMO member states earlier this month voted to delay the framework’s adoption by a year, and those involved in the talks said its implementation could be rescheduled towards the end of this decade — if it ever occurred.

“The delay will in reality lead to a reopening of text because a revision of dates is required,” Danish Maritime Authority’s Chief Advisor Thomas Blomgren-Hansen said, as the regulation can only enter into force 16 months after adoption based on international law.

“That could lead a complete renegotiation, putting the whole deal at risk [and] delaying the transition for an even longer period,” Blomgren-Hansen said on LinkedIn.

S&P Global Commodity Insights estimates oil-based fuels made up 97% of the global bunker mix in 2024, followed by LNG at 2%.

The new IMO regulation, which would place a cost on bunker fuels’ GHG from 2028, is designed to reduce the price gap between conventional and sustainable fuels.

The monthly average delivered bunker price for 0.5% sulfur fuel oil, the most common bunker type, was $483.73/metric ton in Singapore in September, compared with $579.17/mt very low sulfur fuel oil equivalent for LNG, $691.92/mtVLSFOe for B24 biobunker fuel with 24% used cooking oil methyl ester, and $1,897.44/mtVLSFOe for 100% sustainable methanol, according to the Platts bunker cost calculator.

The IMO’s decision to delay the adoption has created uncertainties among shipping and bunker companies in pursuit of a low-carbon transition, even though member states will have a chance to improve the framework’s design, many industry participants said.

“After what happened … I can understand why people don’t want to double down on net-zero fuels,” Cargill’s shipping head, Jan Dieleman, said during the Global Maritime Forum on Oct. 21.

Delayed adoption

In April, EU member states, Singapore, Brazil and some others won a 63-16 vote to approve the new rules, which still need to be adopted based on the IMO’s regulatory process.

The US, Russia, Venezuela and some Middle Eastern oil-producing countries have maintained their opposition to the framework, which they argue is attached with punitively high carbon costs, overly stringent decarbonization requirements, and harsh on transition fuel consumers.

Saudi Arabia proposed to postpone the framework’s adoption amid the deep rift, and its motion is backed by a slim majority including China, India and some major flag states like Panama and Liberia that supported it in April.

Despite an EU mandate to adopt the IMO regulation, Greece and Cyprus — two EU members that are among the world’s top shipowning nations — abstained from the postponement vote.

Vassilis Kikilias, Greece’s Minister of Shipping, said after the vote that the framework has “unfair treatment of LNG fuel” and would likely cause serious disruptions in global trade and lead to inflation.

IMO member states will continue to develop implementation guidelines to address concerns over the framework, including how the carbon revenue would be used and a lifecycle assessment methodology for GHG, according Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez.

“The framework is in place, what we need to do is to develop the guideline,” Dominguez told the GMF. “What we paused is the adoption itself, not further work.”

Classification DNV estimates LNG could be a non-compliant fuel at the turn of this decade based on the current regulatory design, but IMO member states could in theory prolong its use by setting a low default emissions factor.

“LNG just got another improvement in its relative competitiveness versus the fully green fuels,” consultancy Vespucci Maritime CEO Lars Jensen said, citing increased uncertainty over the investment case for green fuel production due to the framework’s delayed adoption.

Outlook

LNG can reduce emissions by 20%-30% compared with oil-based fuels, and its supporters said ships with LNG-capable propulsion can later switch to bio-LNG or e-LNG for deep decarbonization when the low-carbon fuels become widely available.

“The methane pathway is currently the only practical, realistic and scalable solution to the decarbonization of the global maritime industry,” according to a statement from SEA-LNG, an industry association set up to promote marine LNG with Shell and TotalEnergies among its members.

The association will work with others to “continue to develop meaningful, scientific studies to support the IMO’s critical work” in the coming year, SEA-LNG said following the postponement vote.

In a recent study commissioned by SEA-LNG, Rystad Energy estimates the well-to-tank GHG intensity of LNG bunker at 13.9 grams of CO2e/megajoule in 2024, compared with 18.8 grams of CO2e/Mj in 2019.

His new book, Making Waves: PR strategies to transform your maritime business, will be published by Rethink Press on Amazon on November 4.

The sound of screeching breaks can be heard around the world. There can be little doubt the bruising confrontations at the International Maritime Organization (IMO) earlier this month are thrusting maritime further into the mainstream and the optics are not great.

Splash reported that shipping has suffered its biggest setback in 40 years as delegates at the IMO, under pressure from the US, voted to delay the IMO Net Zero Framework for a year. A measure backed by many in the IMO six months ago is now on life support.

Maritime has hardly taken its public relations in the mainstream media seriously for decades and now there is a reckoning. Check this stinging rebuke from the Wall Street Journal: “This week we warned that a United Nations agency you’ve never heard of was about to impose the first global carbon tax—on shipping. We’re pleased to report it blinked. The whole project smacked of the taxation without representation that America was founded to resist.” Ouch.

We cannot say we did not see this coming. There were clear signs of fracturing relationships during last month’s London International Shipping Week when ABS CEO Christopher Wiernicki dropped a bombshell saying: “Shipping and the IMO are on different trajectories.”

Many have warned you cannot choose to be low profile. The news can come to you. And if you have not built a reputation communicating good behaviour you cannot expect the mainstream to give you the benefit of the doubt when a story like this breaks and a schism within the sector develops.

This is now a massive public relations challenge for maritime. If the sector does not stand up for itself the vacuum will be filled by negativity and misinformation.

As we all know the decarbonisation question is incredibly difficult for our sector. And maritime must now up its game and educate the mainstream about its “emissions Everest”, setting out the immense cost to decarbonise the industry – up to $1.9trn. And further explain how difficult it is to find an alternative fuel to power ships the size of the Empire State Building with 120,000 hp engines.

Failure to get this right risks a deeper reputational backlash. Today, as is well documented within the industry, shipping is responsible for 3% of global emissions but that could rise to 18$ by 2050 as other sectors like road, rail and aerospace decarbonise much more quickly and easily leaving maritime exposed as the laggard.

In addition, maritime should now double down and highlight the billions being invested in decarbonisation and innovation. The industry can point to some seriously impressive results: between 2009 and 2019, carbon dioxide emissions fell by approximately 14%, according to Clarkson estimates, despite a roughly 40% increase in cargo volumes. Quite an achievement, and one we should be shouting from the rooftops, thanks to slow steaming and new greener technology. In comparison, emissions from road transport rose by about 20%, while those from air transport grew by around 25%.

Maritime can further point to the huge efforts it is making to tackle emissions, from wind power to retrofits deploying batteries, to greener alternative fuels, to high-tech AI routing efficiencies and weather mapping, as well as hull cleaning.

For all the trials and tribulations at the IMO, this is an incredible effort and should now be championed, not just in the maritime press but celebrated across mainstream and social media. Now in light of the crisis engulfing the IMO this campaign is needed more than ever.",https://splash247.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMO-HQ-building-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-26 17:16:28.539669

Saudi Arabia had joined with the United States, pressuring the member states before Singapore tabled the adjournment to give the IMO more time.
Many had left the first session, saying the IMO was giving confusing signals and creating more problems than solutions for the industry.
Many wondered if the framework would even be adopted, or if it was the first step in its death knell.
The feeling was that the workgroup moved forward, “moving past obstruction and into real progress,” said Jamie Yates, Climate & Renewable Energy Manager for Pacific Environment.","The IMO’s International Maritime Organization’s Intersessional Working Group on Reduction of Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Ships wrapped up a week of closed-door meetings with observers agreeing there had been progress and a promising outlook for the future. Observers said the working group had been able to rise above the rancor of the prior week’s special session of MEPC (Marine Environment Protection Committee) and get back to work on the Net-Zero Framework.

“We observed constructive participation from all parties — including those with prior concerns — which led to real progress on key technical guidelines,” said Dr. Annika Frosch, Research Fellow at UCL Shipping and Oceans Research Group. “Even previously contentious topics, such as the Net Zero Fund, experienced broad and active involvement from many delegations, helping to clarify priorities like establishing the Governing Board and fundamental principles to guide the fund’s future work.”

Many others, especially in the NGO community, expressed a renewed sense of optimism at the close of the working session on Friday, October 24. Delaine McCullough of the Clear Shipping Council highlighted that it had become clear that the adjournment was “just a postponement and not the end” of the framework. Emma Fenton, Senior Diplomacy Director at Opportunity Green, noted that countries had come together to work on the supporting guidelines that will provide the much-needed clarity.

The week before, member states that had supported the Net-Zero Framework in April 2025 moved away, and became cautious, in part due to strong pressure and threats from the United States and others. Saudi Arabia had joined with the United States, pressuring the member states before Singapore tabled the adjournment to give the IMO more time.

Many had left the first session, saying the IMO was giving confusing signals and creating more problems than solutions for the industry. Many wondered if the framework would even be adopted, or if it was the first step in its death knell. Even those who believed there would be progress had to concede that the regulation was now likely not to come into force till January 1, 2029.

“Understanding what happened at the IMO in October and why is now central not just for any chance of future adoption, but for just and equitable climate action generally,” commented Dr. Tristan Smith, Professor of Energy and Transport at UCL Shipping and Oceans Research Group. “This lost momentum can be recovered, but we have taken a step closer to the abyss that is dangerous climate change.”

The working group tackled the key challenges in the framework, and while there were no formal decisions, observers are saying there was steady progress in the discussion of the details for the implementation. Hot topics included how the regulation should incentivize energy transition, how the fund should be set up, and how the lifecycle and sustainability of different fuels should be evaluated and certified. Lifecycle analysis was widely discussed, and support seemed to be emerging to support differentiating rewards for different fuels. The role of biofuels was also a key topic.

Wind propulsion was also back in the spotlight, notes Anaïs Rios, Shipping Policy Officer for Seas at Risk. The International Windship Association highlights strong momentum for wind-assisted propulsion, reporting that there are nearly 100 large vessels with wind propulsion, representing around five million DTW. They expect the fleet will roughly double in the next 12 months and that this momentum will carry into the framework discussions. Similarly, John Maggs, Clean Shipping Coalition’s Representative at IMO, is calling for transforming the CII into an energy efficiency powerhouse to get shipping’s climate action back on course.

Christiaan de Beukelaer, Senior Lecturer in Culture and Climate at the University of Melbourne and an IMO observer, noted that the obstructionist states in the first week opposed adoption due to a lack of detail, and the second week opposed discussing details ahead of adoption. However, “under the conciliatory guidance of Working Group Chair Sveinung Oftedahl, the vast majority of delegations in the room worked on ensuring that the IMO can deliver on its unanimously-adopted 2023 GHG Strategy through the Net-Zero Framework. This made the saboteurs sound like a broken record, which the room quietly ignored.""

The feeling was that the workgroup moved forward, “moving past obstruction and into real progress,” said Jamie Yates, Climate & Renewable Energy Manager for Pacific Environment. Natacha Stamatiou, IMO GHG Lead, Global Shipping for the Environmental Defense Fund, agreed, noting, “Luckily, this week, more voices joined the conversation, and the discussions took on a constructive and more respectful tone. It was a meaningful step toward rebuilding the confidence, transparency, and integrity we need to deliver the pollution cuts future generations deserve.”",https://maritime-executive.com/media/images/article/Photos/Navy_Govt_CoastGuard/imo-hq-flags.jpg,N,,2025-10-26 17:16:33.383808

Columns (3) to (4) examine the impact of intensity geopolitical risk, measured by multiplying the mean value by the corresponding annual geopolitical risk level.
This can be attributed to the marked increase in geopolitical risks post-2021, driven by a higher frequency of global geopolitical events (see Fig.","Global shipping, accounting for ~3% of global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions1, poses an urgent climate challenge in a world striving for deep decarbonization2. As the world intensifies its efforts to combat climate change, the International Maritime Organization (IMO), responsible for regulating global maritime transport, has continuously updated its objectives. The current goal is to achieve zero-carbon emissions by 2050, thereby deepening shipping’s contribution to climate mitigation3. However, decarbonizing global shipping faces significant challenges4. Some challenges have been widely discussed. For example, long-term projections under different scenarios for global trade reveal a 1–5-fold increase in future seaborne trade5,6. This growth implies that the shipping sector will require amounts of alternative energy, low-emission technologies, more efficient design, and upgraded port infrastructures to offset the effects of trade growth and meet the IMO 2050 goals7,8. However, the development of these alternatives remains nascent, requiring substantial investments of time and financial resources from nations to bridge the current implementation and ambition gaps9,10,11,12.

Geopolitical risks are emerging as another critical challenge to decarbonization efforts in global shipping. Geopolitical risk denotes systemic disruptions arising from interstate conflict, territorial disputes, economic sanctions, regional instability, or armed confrontation, and is commonly classified into action risks (e.g., military interventions, sanctions) and threat risks (e.g., terrorism, regional instability, and rising nationalism)13. These risks disrupt global trade flows, alter shipping routes, and affect fuel supply chains14,15,16, all of which contribute to fluctuations in maritime carbon emissions. For instance, recent geopolitical events, such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the tensions in the South China Sea, and the Palestine-Israel conflict, have forced vessels to take longer, less efficient routes, thereby increasing carbon emissions17,18. Additionally, geopolitical crises force countries to focus on domestic and regional issues, particularly basic security concerns like energy and food. This shift in focus could lead to a slowdown in global technological development, casting doubt on future progress and investment in decarbonization technologies9. Beyond physical disruptions, more critically, geopolitical risks could influence nations’ willingness to collaborate on decarbonization initiatives, undermining collective efforts to achieve climate targets19.

Recent work examines the localized impact of geopolitical events on maritime operations and concerns about the decarbonization process20,21. Studies by Lyu et al.22, and Xu et al.23 quantified CO₂ increases from rerouted shipping lanes during the Russia–Ukraine conflict and Red Sea crisis, while Shapovalova et al.24 and Hoffart et al.25 demonstrated how sanctions, disrupted fuel corridors, and geopolitical uncertainty alter fuel procurement patterns and delay emissions reduction strategies. However, systematic analyses remain scarce regarding how geopolitical risks reshape national decarbonization commitments across diverse contexts, which is a critical gap given that policy ambition drives sectoral transitions26,27.

However, quantitatively assessing the impacts of geopolitical risks on shipping decarbonization efforts is constrained by two main obstacles: First, establishing a robust causal link requires moving beyond traditional spatial emission attribution to actor-level time-series data, which is essential for causal verification. Existing studies have primarily examined localized shipping emission shifts around major geopolitical events28,29. Although extensive Automatic Identification System (AIS)-based ship emission datasets can capture immediate changes30, they fail to establish causality and remain largely observational. Second, the delayed effects of geopolitical risks are difficult to capture, resulting in a notable gap in longitudinal and cross-national comparative studies. Geopolitical risks exert a long-term impact through structural shifts in global trade and energy markets, reshaping national decarbonization strategies such as maritime operations, fuel procurement strategies, green technology investments, and international climate cooperation31. Nations’ decarbonization efforts vary due to differing geopolitical pressures and environmental priorities, further underscoring the need for research on their evolving and heterogeneous impacts.

This study addresses these gaps by answering a research question, to what extent do geopolitical risk influence the willingness of countries to reduce emissions in the maritime sector? We constructed a dataset of 518,190,352 words from 52 countries and ten major shipping media outlets between January 2010 to April 2024. Using natural language processing (NLP), we assessed attitude shifts towards decarbonization at both general and national levels. We then employed quasi-experimental causal inference to evaluate the effects of geopolitical risks including benchmark, multi-period and heterogeneity analyses. We validated the effects by analyzing actual CO2 emissions of global vessel navigation based on the updated Ship Traffic Emission Assessment Model (STEAM) model. The algorithmic framework and model evaluation are described in the Methods.

Our findings indicate that geopolitical risks can reduce national willingness to decarbonize, with heightened geopolitical risks contributing to the further deterioration of decarbonization attitudes. To validate this causal relationship, we analyzed global shipping carbon emissions and found that geopolitical risks escalate emissions and reshape long-term emission patterns. Moreover, the effects of geopolitical risks vary across countries. Nations with substantial maritime trade, advanced economies, and high carbon intensity are more likely to prioritize economic stability and security over environmental goals. When combined with existing research32, our results suggest that this decline in decarbonization ambition could potentially delay the IMO’s zero-carbon target by up to 50 years. In so doing, this research provides critical insights for policymakers seeking to navigate the complex intersection of climate action and international relations.

Temporal trends in attitudes towards shipping decarbonization

To examine the spatiotemporal evolution of the shipping decarbonization attitudes under varying geopolitical risks exposure, we utilized nation-level decarbonization attitude scores derived from NLP-based sentiment analysis of news text big data alongside the Geopolitical Risk Index developed by Caldara and Iacoviello13. The national decarbonization attitude score ranges from −1 to 1 and is proxied as the ratio of the total sentiment score of all text documents in that country for the year to the total sentiment score of all countries worldwide. It reflects the overall attitude of stakeholders or practitioners in the country’s shipping industry toward decarbonization goals, ranging from positive to negative or neutral, which affects the efficiency of their subsequent decarbonization actions. Figure 1a reveals a strong correlation between major geopolitical events and shifts in decarbonization attitudes. Before 2019, attitudes exhibited moderate fluctuations, reflecting a gradual alignment with climate goals. However, post-2019, geopolitical tensions increasingly overshadowed environmental priorities, underscoring the challenge of sustaining momentum amid crises. The 2022 Russia–Ukraine conflict marked a turning point, triggering a pronounced and sustained decline in attitude scores across many nations from an average of 0.707 to 0.556. Subsequent events, including the Nord Stream pipeline explosion and the Palestine–Israel conflict, further exacerbated negative trends.

Figure 1b illustrates the geographical variations of geopolitical risk and annual decarbonization attitude across selected countries. The geopolitical risk index exhibits a general increase, with a more pronounced rise in the Global North compared to the Global South. Specifically, regions such as Europe, East Asia, and North America display increases in geopolitical risk, with countries like Russia, and the United States exhibiting particularly high levels of risk escalation. This disparity underscores differing geopolitical pressures between the Global North and Global South.

The line graphs for each country reveal the temporal dynamics of national decarbonization attitudes. Key observations indicate greater volatility and frequent changes in decarbonization attitudes until 2018, likely reflecting evolving policy responses and strategic adjustments as nations established frameworks for shipping sector decarbonization. However, the shipping industry’s attitude toward decarbonization has improved since 2018. This is mainly due to two factors: the greenhouse gas emission reduction strategy adopted by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has catalyzed relevant international green shipping policies, and green shipping investment has undergone a structural transformation. Specific instances include: the launch of the global ship financing initiative known as the “Poseidon Principles” and the active response from financial institutions; the signing of the “Clyde Bank Declaration” by 22 countries to jointly build a “green shipping corridor”; and the rapid development of green shipping finance—the issuance of the industry’s first green bond by Japanese shipowner NYK Line is a clear testament to this. Nevertheless, a discernible deceleration in decarbonization momentum is observed post-2020. This slowdown is particularly evident in several Global North countries, such as European nations and Middle Eastern states, where heightened geopolitical risks appear to coincide with a diminished commitment to decarbonization. In Europe, for instance, countries like the United Kingdom, Germany, and France exhibit a decline in the growth rate of decarbonization attitudes after 2021. Similarly, Middle Eastern countries such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates display a notable decline. Conversely, countries in Southeast Asia (such as Thailand, Singapore, and Indonesia) display more consistent and less volatile decarbonization attitudes, with comparatively subdued changes.

Detecting the impact of geopolitical risks on national decarbonization attitudes

We quantify the causal relationship between geopolitical risk and national decarbonization attitudes using a difference-in-differences analysis with staggered treatment (staggered DID) analysis (see “Methods”). Figure 2 presents the empirical regression results and parallel trends test results. Figure 2a reports the main estimates, incorporating nation-level control variables. The coefficient of Geo_risk×Intensity is negative and statistically significant at the 1% level. Specifically, the result indicates a decrease of 14.38 percentage points in decarbonization attitudes following the treatment.

Figure 2b provides support for parallel trends, the main causal assumption of DID designs, which requires that treatment and control groups follow similar outcome trends before the intervention, thereby allowing post-treatment divergence to be attributed to the causal effect. Prior to the occurrence of geopolitical risk (−1 Period), the coefficient estimates are insignificantly different from 0, indicating no significant difference between the treatment and control groups before the shocks. Following the onset of geopolitical risk, the decarbonization attitudes decrease significantly in the sample experiencing geopolitical risk, consistent with the benchmark regression results. Figure 2b further illustrates a persistent negative shift in decarbonization attitudes following major geopolitical disruption.

Figure 2c provides the detailed benchmark regression results, with all regressions controlled for country and time fixed effects. The estimates remain consistent across different controls, underscoring the detrimental effect of geopolitical risks on national decarbonization attitudes. Columns (1) to (2) show the effect of non-intensity geopolitical risk, measured as the average risk level for each country over the study period. Columns (3) to (4) examine the impact of intensity geopolitical risk, measured by multiplying the mean value by the corresponding annual geopolitical risk level. The coefficients of intensity geopolitical risk (columns 3 and 4) amplify both the significance and scale of the observed impacts, emphasizing the instantaneous impact of geopolitical risks on national decarbonization attitudes. Columns (2) and (4) include nation-level control variables to account for additional factors that may simultaneously affect a country’s decarbonization attitude. All coefficients are negative and statistically significant at the 5% level or better. Specially, the coefficients of Port development and Carbon peak are negative and significant at the 1% level, indicating that countries with higher port throughput and peak carbon dioxide emissions are more susceptible to geopolitical risks, causing them to waver their decarbonization stance. This finding provides empirical evidence for the Tragedy of the Commons in the current climate actions of the shipping sector.

Comprehensive robustness tests reinforce the reliability and validity of our findings (see Supplementary Results 2).

We also observe pronounced temporal volatility in national maritime decarbonization attitudes in Fig. 1b, which may reflect the sensitivity of sustainability commitments to evolving geopolitical dynamics. To further explore this relationship, we performed a staged regression analysis to examine how the causal relationship between geopolitical risk and national decarbonization attitudes evolves over time. We divided the time period into three distinct time spans: 2010–2013, 2014–2017, and 2018–2021. As shown in Fig. 3, geopolitical risks had no significant impact on national decarbonization attitudes in the first stage (Column 1). However, in the second and third stages (Columns 2 and 3), the coefficients of Geo_risk×Intensity are all negative and statistically significant at the 1% level, with geopolitical risks in the third stage exerting increasingly detrimental effects. This suggests that geopolitical risk has a significant impact on national decarbonization attitudes, and this impact deepened over time.

We conducted another two-stage regression analysis, excluding the initial period of 2010–2013. The remaining time period was divided into two equal spans: 2013–2018 and 2018–2023. The coefficients of Geo_risk×Intensity are consistently negative and statistically significant (Columns 4 and 5), indicating a causal relationship between geopolitical risk and diminishing national decarbonization attitudes. We observe a statistically significant relationship at the 1% level in the later stages, reflecting a stronger causal link between geopolitical risks and declining decarbonization attitudes over time. It suggests that heightened geopolitical risks substantially contribute to the deterioration of decarbonization attitudes. This can be attributed to the marked increase in geopolitical risks post-2021, driven by a higher frequency of global geopolitical events (see Fig. 1a). However, this effect diminishes in the second period, comparing −0.1591 and −0.1285. As discussed in reference to Fig. 1b, IMO has adopted a more comprehensive and frequent set of climate-responsive measures since 2018. This suggests that climate policies need to be continuously strengthened and monitored to effectively counteract external risks.

The heterogeneity in national decarbonization attitudes

Building on the benchmark and multi-period regression analyses, we proceed to examine how national decarbonization attitudes vary across countries when confronted with geopolitical risks, thereby providing a deeper understanding of heterogeneous responses. To examine these differences, we classified countries into two groups: the top 50% and the bottom 50%, which enables us to highlight the variations between nations with differing economic scales, military strengths, and cultural backgrounds in their responses to geopolitical challenges. Detailed indicator settings and regression results are provided in Supplementary Results 2.

Figure 4 illustrates the heterogeneity analysis of national decarbonization attitudes in response to geopolitical risks, highlighting how different countries are variably affected by national characteristic factors. The coefficients for almost all groups are significantly negative, revealing that increased geopolitical risk correlates with a decline in decarbonization willingness. However, the degree of this effect varies significantly across nations.

First, we examined the level of economic development, degree of openness, and carbon emission intensity to analyze the heterogeneity of national decarbonization attitudes influenced by national macroeconomic and institutional factors. The coefficients for all groups are significantly negative, with the high groups being significant at the 1% level and lower than those of the low groups. This indicates that countries with higher levels of economic development, greater openness, and higher carbon emission intensity are more likely to scale back their decarbonization ambitions in response to geopolitical risks. This trend underscores the complex relationship between economic structures, energy intensity, and climate policy willingness, especially in the context of global geopolitical volatility.

Second, we explored the heterogeneity of national decarbonization attitudes influenced by national military capabilities and social stability by examining three indicators: military expenditure (MEP), quantity of weapons purchased (QWP), and the origin of refugees (ROI). The coefficients for all groups are significantly negative. Notably, the coefficients for Low_MEP and Low_QWP show greater reductions, with average decreases of ~20.21% and 17.73%, respectively. The coefficient of High_ROI is lower than that Low_ROI, with an average decrease of ~17.17%. This indicates that countries with certain military and social stability characteristics are less prone to reduce their decarbonization ambitions in response to geopolitical risks. It suggests that countries facing greater social and political pressures prioritize maintaining social stability, potentially limiting the impact of geopolitical risks on their decarbonization commitments.

Finally, we investigated the impact of religious and cultural factors, including religious populations (RPO), power distance (PDI), and uncertainty avoidance (UAI). The findings highlight the importance of religious and cultural factors in shaping national responses to geopolitical crises, revealing that such factors can influence policy decisions in diverse and complex ways. The coefficients for RPO groups are all significantly negative, with a decrease of 18.91% for Low_RPO compared to a 14.74% decrease for High_RPO. The coefficients of Low_PDI and Low_UAI are negative and significant at the 1% level, while no significant causal effects were found in the high groups. The results indicate that cultures with more evenly distributed power and higher risk tolerance may be more adaptable in adjusting their decarbonization policies in response to external geopolitical factors. In contrast, no significant causal effects were found in the high groups of PDI and UAI, suggesting that countries with higher PDI (more hierarchical societies) and higher UAI (greater resistance to change) may be less responsive to geopolitical risks when altering their decarbonization objectives.

Verifying the association between carbon emissions and geopolitical risks

Building on our earlier findings on the evolving attitudes toward shipping decarbonization and the disruptive role of geopolitical risks, we provide empirical evidence linking these risks to actual shifts in global shipping emissions. Drawing from a comprehensive dataset of over 100,000 vessels, we quantified the impact of geopolitical crises on maritime CO₂ emissions and carbon intensity (DIST). This analysis demonstrates how geopolitical instability reshapes shipping CO2 emission patterns (see “Methods”).

Figure 5 highlights that geopolitical risks have led to an overall increase in carbon emissions, reinforcing the observed decline in decarbonization ambition. While regional conflicts, such as the Russia–Ukraine conflict (Fig. 5a) and the Nord Stream pipeline explosion (Fig. 5b), resulted in moderate emission increases, disruptions within major shipping corridors induced far greater surges in both total CO₂ emissions and carbon intensity across vessel types worldwide (Fig. 5c, Supplementary Figs. 12–17). This pattern reinforces our earlier findings that nations with high trade dependence tend to deprioritize decarbonization efforts amid geopolitical uncertainty. This is evidenced by increased emissions along key shipping corridors and a heightened reliance on carbon-intensive trade routes following geopolitical disruptions.

Specifically, the escalation of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, compounded by the Nord Stream pipeline blast, triggered a 1.5% increase in global shipping CO2 emissions (Fig. 5a, b). This pattern was reflected across most major shipping chokepoints, where emissions rose by 1.4% to 15.3%, with energy transport vessels being particularly affected (detailed in Supplementary Figs. 12–17). The outbreak of the Palestine–Israel conflict led to a substantial increase in carbon emissions from vessels compelled to navigate alternative routes around the Cape of Good Hope on Pacific and Indian Ocean routes (Fig. 5c). Carbon emissions from vessels transiting the Cape of Good Hope (chokepoint 12 in Fig. 5c) increased by 61.3% over a six-month period. Notably, shipping emissions between October 2023 and April 2024 rose by 1.36 million tonnes compared to the same period in the previous year.

Concurrently, the carbon intensity indicators DIST and TIME experienced increases of 9.40% and 35.96%, respectively, reaching 28.71 tonnes CO₂ per nautical mile and 0.51 tonnes CO₂ per hour. Simultaneously, ship carbon emissions exhibit a distinct north-south divergence. Carbon emissions from vessels originating in Europe declined, whereas emissions from vessels from West Africa saw a increase. These findings reinforce our earlier analysis, which highlighted the heterogeneous nature of national decarbonization responses to geopolitical risks. While some nations intensified their reliance on carbon-intensive trade routes, evidenced by rising emissions along major shipping corridors and increased energy transport disruptions.

Natural language processing to analyze decarbonization attitudes

Assessing and quantifying the decarbonization attitudes of the global shipping sector and countries relied on seaborne trade is essential for evaluating the feasibility of current climate targets, beyond mere economic and technical assessments. To achieve this, we compiled a comprehensive dataset from the top 10 global shipping industry news websites, as well as national data from Google News and government policies from 52 countries, spanning the period from 2010 to 2024. This extensive dataset comprises 518,190,352 words. The national-level data was analyzed by categorizing publishers such as corporations, industries, and government agencies, within their respective countries. Further details on data sources, collection methods, and processing steps can be found in Supplementary Methods 1 and 2.

This study explores attitudes toward shipping decarbonization on two levels. First, by assessing the industry’s perceptions and responses to decarbonization efforts, it captures the industry’s general attitude, defined as the perceived feasibility of meeting decarbonization targets, ranging from highly negative to highly positive. Second, national attitudes and their evolution are analyzed using NLP on news data, reflecting policies, strategies, and official positions adopted by governments to address climate change and promote sustainability in shipping. National-level data is analyzed by categorizing publishers from corporations, industries, and government agencies as nested entities within their respective countries, with sentiment scores ranging from extremely negative to extremely positive.

Sentiment analysis, a widely used tool in NLP, is particularly valuable in the context of increasingly accessible online text data. It enables the examination of emotional responses to specific events and the evolution of attitudes over time. To conduct the sentiment analysis, we evaluated four NLP methods for model selection, including Lexicon-based models, machine learning, BERT-based open-source models, and transfer learning-based closed-source models. Given the complexity and emotional nuances of our text data, we ultimately chose a closed-source large language model (LLM) based on transfer learning. By designing prompts, building application programming interfaces, and leveraging the Zero-Shot task processing capability of the LLM, we enabled the model to interpret and complete specified tasks, producing the required information. Due to the complexity of the language and the subtlety of sentiment expression, we applied a transfer learning-based model for sentiment classification. This method was selected for its enhanced capacity to capture domain-specific semantic variation and to identify attitudes within nuanced discourse. Benchmarking against annotated data demonstrated an average 9.897% improvement over alternative approaches. A detailed account of model selection and comparative analysis can be found in Supplementary Methods 2.

Accordingly, our modeling scheme is designed as shown in Supplementary Methods 2. First, we preprocessed all texts and transformed them into a format readable by the LLM. We designed customized prompts for both global and national text data, enabling the LLM to assess their relevance to the decarbonization topic. The LLM then evaluated the decarbonization attitude of each text, categorizing them as positive (1), neutral (0), or negative (−1), and provided supporting reasons for these assessments. Finally, we generated normalized output; a sample of the output can be found in Supplementary Methods 2.

Next, we grouped the national text data outputs by year and country. By calculating the mean sentiment scores for each group, we captured the comprehensive decarbonization attitudes of each country in a specific year. This process yielded in a 15\(\times\)52 dataset (encompassing 15 years from 2010 to 2024 and 52 countries) along with corresponding mean scores. A detailed sample of our processing results can be found in Supplementary Methods 2.

Impact evaluation using staggered difference-in-differences analysis

(1) Model specification

To evaluate the impact of geopolitical risk on national attitudes towards emission reduction, we employed a staggered difference-in-differences model to analyze changes in national attitudes towards decarbonization before and after geopolitical risks. Details on the method selection are presented in Supplementary Methods 5. The following benchmark regression model was constructed.

$${Attitud}{e}_{{it}}={\alpha }_{0}+{\alpha }_{1}{Geo}{{\_}}{ris}{k}_{{it}}\times {Intensit}{y}_{{it}}+\gamma {Contro}{l}_{{it}}+{\mu }_{i}+{\upsilon }_{t}+{\lambda }_{{it}}$$

(1)

Where \({Attitud}{e}_{{it}}\) represents the attitude of country i towards decarbonization in year t; \({Geo\_ris}{k}_{{it}}\) represents whether country i is exposed to geopolitical risks in year t; \(Intensit{y}_{it}\) represents the geopolitical risk intensity of country i in year t; \({Contro}{l}_{{it}}\) are a set of country-level control variables to control for country characteristics. \({\mu }_{i}\) indicates individual fixed effects, \({\upsilon }_{t}\) represents time fixed effects, and \({\lambda }_{{it}}\) is a randomized perturbation term. Considering the strong correlation between decarbonization attitudes of a country in different years, we also performed country-level robust clustering standard errors. We focus on the coefficient \({\alpha }_{1}\). If \({\alpha }_{1}\) is significantly smaller than 0, it indicates that geopolitical risk substantially reduces a country’s incentives to decarbonize, potentially leading to delays in achieving decarbonization targets.

(2) Measurement of key variables and data description

The explained variable is the country’s decarbonization attitude, derived from sentiment analysis results.

The core explanatory variable in our study is geopolitical risk. When conducting the DID analysis, it is essential to divide the sample into treatment and control groups based on their exposure to policy shocks. However, geopolitical risks invariably affect all countries, making it impractical to create strictly separate treatment and control groups. To address this challenge, we constructed a policy-like experimental DID model that incorporates risk intensity. To determine whether a country is affected by geopolitical conflict (\({Geo\_ris}{k}_{{it}}\)), we calculated the mean value of the geopolitical risk index for each country during the study period. Countries with an index above the mean were assigned to the treatment group, while those below the mean were placed in the control group. Furthermore, we set the treatment intensity indicator \({Intensit}{y}_{{it}}\) as the corresponding geopolitical risk level for each year. Thus, the interaction term \({Geo\_ris}{k}_{{it}}\times {Intensit}{y}_{{it}}\) serves as the treatment effect variable.

The fundamental premise of a staggered DID model is the parallel trend assumption, which requires the treatment group (subject to geopolitical risk) and the control group (not subject to geopolitical risk) exhibit parallel trends in their changes over time prior to the onset of geopolitical risks. This study employed an event study approach for parallel trend testing, detailed in Supplementary Results 1.

We employed seven control variables to account for potential confounding factors that could influence the relationship between geopolitical risks and national attitudes toward decarbonization. Each variable was selected based on its potential impact on decarbonization efforts and its relevance to the specific context of our study. Descriptive statistics for these variables are presented in Supplementary Methods 5.

(3) Causality tests

In addition to verifying the parallel trend assumption, we conducted multiple robustness tests to ensure the validity of our results. Details of these tests can be found in Supplementary Results 2.

Test 1: placebo tests

To eliminate the possibility that the observed differences between treatment and control groups were due to time changes, we advanced the impact times of geopolitical risk by 1–8 periods and re-ran the regressions. The result showed that the coefficients of all assumed cross-terms were insignificant, indicating no systematic time trend differences between the treatment the control groups. This confirms the robustness of our benchmark regression.

Test 2: heterogeneity treatment effect test

Although our benchmark regression accounted for national-level characteristic variables, unobserved variables might still introduce estimation bias. To address this, we performed a constrained mixed placebo test using a randomized trial approach with fake treatment units and fake treatment times. The results demonstrated that all coefficients were near zero and followed a normal distribution, indicating that most regression results were not statistically significant. Furthermore, the average treatment effect was insignificant at the 1% level, confirming that our benchmark regression is robust against estimation bias due to omitted variables.

Test 3: propensity score matching (PSM) estimation

The robustness of a staggered DID also relies on the homogeneity assumption of treatment effects. If these effects vary over time or across countries, the regression results may be biased. We addressed this by testing the weights of our benchmark regression estimators. Furthermore, considering the complex entry and exit processes in our model, we adopted the counterfactual estimation method for causal inference to construct imputation estimators for regression. Both tests reported insignificant coefficients, confirming that heterogeneity bias in the treatment effects does not compromise our main conclusions.

To mitigate potential biases arising from significant differences in observable characteristic variables between the treatment and control groups before the occurrence of geopolitical risks, we employed a propensity score matching (PSM) method. This approach enabled us to identify and match control samples with observable characteristics most similar to each treatment group sample. The results showed that all coefficients remained significantly negative, demonstrating that our benchmark regression results are robust even after accounting for potential selection bias.

Test 4: variable transformations

We conducted four additional robustness tests on variable transformations. These included reconstructing the core explanatory variable, standardizing the geopolitical risk index to a range of 0 to 1, and excluding samples from periods 1 to 2 before and after the occurrence of geopolitical risks. The results showed that the core explanatory variables remained significant at the 1% level, further confirming the robustness of our benchmark results.

Bottom-up estimation of the shipping CO2 emissions

The CO2 emission inventory of shipping here is estimated using the updated STEAM. The inventory contains CO2 emissions from the main engine, auxiliary engine, and boiler of ships. We applied AIS data from January 2021 to April 2024 and updated ship technical specification data to the emission calculations. The AIS data underwent noise reduction treatment, including the removal of duplicate signal points, eliminating drifted points, etc. We corrected and interpolated missing and erroneous data in the specification information of ships using regression analysis. For more details, please refer to the Supplementary Methods 6. A global day-by-day shipping CO2 emission inventory (0.05° × 0.05°) was constructed primarily based on the following formula.

$$E={E}_{{ME}}+{E}_{{AE}}+{E}_{B}$$

(2)

$${E}_{{AE}}={P}_{{AE}}\times {\left(\frac{{V}_{{actual}}}{{V}_{{design}}}\right)}^{3}\times {T}_{v}\times E{F}_{{AE}}$$

(3)

$${E}_{{AE}}={P}_{i,{ae}}\times {T}_{v}\times E{F}_{{AE}}$$

(4)

$${E}_{B}={P}_{i,b}\times {T}_{v}\times E{F}_{B}$$

Where \(E\) represents the total emissions of the ships; \({E}_{{ME}}\), \({E}_{{AE}}\) and \({E}_{B}\) represent the emissions (g) of the main engine, the auxiliary engine, and the boiler, respectively; \({V}_{{actual}}\) is the ship’s real-time speed (knot h-1); \({V}_{{design}}\) represent the ship’s design speed (knot h-1); \(\frac{{V}_{{actual}}}{{V}_{{design}}}\) represents the load factor of the main engine of the ship according to the propeller law; \({T}_{v}\) represents the duration (h) of the ship’s voyage at the speed \({V}_{{actual}}\); \(i\) represents the four operational modes of the ship (berthing, anchoring, maneuvering, or cruising); \(E{F}_{{ME}}\), \(E{F}_{{AE}}\) and \(E{F}_{B}\) represent the emission factors (g kW-1 h-1) of the main engine, auxiliary engine, and boiler, respectively, and their reference values are given in IMO (2021).",https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs43247-025-02852-7/MediaObjects/43247_2025_2852_Fig1_HTML.png,N,,2025-10-26 08:16:28.491484

The administration also moved to pull the U.S. from discussions with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in February, ordering federal scientists to halt work on all climate assessment-related activities.

More recently, Trump and his Cabinet have taken aim at several European Union- and United Nations-backed climate-focused rules and regulations.

While EU leaders have publicly defended these policies, vowing not to roll them back completely, ramped up pressure from the Trump administration appears to have created more wiggle room in some negotiations.

The Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive

Just this week, the Department of Energy sent a letter to EU officials urging the bloc to roll back the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive.

This directive, set to take effect for some companies in 2027, would require those affected to provide reports on ESG effects and establish liability for ESG violations. The primary aim of the rule is to limit harm to the environment and human rights throughout EU and non-EU supply chains.

Under the current language, companies that fail to comply with the regulations will face a fine of 5% of the company’s global net turnover.

The rule has been heavily criticized by U.S.-based companies, who claim it would cause major barriers to trade between the U.S. and the EU.

“[T]he CSDDD, as it is worded today, poses a significant risk to the affordability and reliability of critical energy supplies for households and businesses across Europe and an existential threat to the future growth, competitiveness, and resilience of the EU’s industrial economy,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright wrote in the letter sent this week, which was cosigned by the Qatari government.

However, while the EU has given no indication that it plans to walk back the directive, European officials appear willing to negotiate some provisions.

Earlier this week, the European Parliament said it would further negotiate changes to the rule during a scheduled vote and hopes to finalize any amendments by the end of the year.

The Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism

The EU is just weeks away from imposing the world’s first large-scale carbon border tariff, much to the chagrin of the Trump administration.

The bloc’s carbon border adjustment mechanism will go into effect in January 2026, with the aim of lowering greenhouse gas emissions associated with its foreign imports.

In early September, Wright said this rule would create “huge legal risks” for U.S. firms selling oil and gas across the pond, threatening trade negotiations established between the administration and the EU during the summer.

“The whole trade talks would fall apart if Europe or the U.S. don’t hold up their end of the deal,” Wright told the Financial Times. “So I think those regulations significantly threaten the ability to implement the trade deal that was agreed to.”

All members of the EU agreed to support plans to modify the carbon tariff in May by exempting any companies that import less than 50 metric tons annually of its covered goods. This change, which was adopted last month, exempts roughly 90% of importers from the carbon fee.

Deforestation ban

The Trump administration is also facing pressure from the U.S. paper and pulp industry to block the EU’s deforestation ban, set to take effect in a matter of months.

The deforestation law, first approved by the EU in June 2023, aims to reduce the number of products consumed in Europe that contribute to deforestation while also lowering carbon emissions and tackling deforestation worldwide.

Under the law, any products made from commodities such as coffee, palm oil, soy, cocoa, cattle, wood, and rubber must not have been imported from recently cleared forests and must not have contributed to forest degradation.

The law, which was delayed last year, was set to take full effect at the end of this year.

EU leaders further moved to soften the rules earlier this week, proposing delaying reporting requirements.

Under the latest proposal, the deforestation ban will still go into effect on Dec. 30, but will offer relief to small operators and larger businesses in low-risk countries, such as the U.S., by not requiring full checks and enforcement for an additional six months to one year, depending on the company’s size.

The European Commission announced it was considering delaying the entire rule by another year earlier this month — a move many liberal members of the European Parliament said was to appease Trump.

International carbon shipping tax

The Trump administration clinched a major win last week by successfully blocking a vote on a carbon tax on the global shipping industry.

The administration had for months said it would impose unfair burdens on the U.S., as it would impose a minimum tax of $100 for every ton of carbon dioxide emitted over the lowest threshold of emissions set. Those that exceed higher thresholds will be forced to pay a $380 fee.

The measure, which was included in a net-zero framework put forth by the International Maritime Organization, had appeared poised to pass.

However, the Trump administration heavily lobbied IMO members to consider punting the vote approving the tax by one year.

On Wednesday, Wright revealed that he called nearly 20 countries, saying the U.S. has “the world’s most influential megaphone by far.”

Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins also said she lobbied nations such as Antigua and Jamaica, calling the administration’s efforts to block the vote “all hands on deck.”

As part of this ramped-up pressure, administration officials levied threats against nations that planned to vote in favor of the measure, including imposing tariffs, visa restrictions, and port controls.

Steve Moore, a former economic adviser to Trump, told the Washington Examiner that the administration should continue to use these tactics to further push the EU on other climate-related policies.

TRUMP PREVAILS AGAINST GLOBAL SHIPPING CARBON TAX PLAN, DELAYING VOTE BY A YEAR

“We should basically say we’re out of the United Nations … that puts a lot of pressure on these countries to heed our advice,” Moore said.

“I think that Trump’s stern opposition to these climate change measures is going to force a lot of countries to realize that they’re futile,” he added.","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP25296747887024-e1761323471227.jpg?resize=1024,683",N,,2025-10-26 06:16:28.149501

Around 80% of all the goods we trade, from oil and iron ore to cars and clothing, move by sea. Every day, huge ships connect producers and consumers across continents.

In this episode of Beyond the Charts, we’re unpacking how this massive system works and how it’s changing, based on insights from the UNCTAD Review of Maritime Transport 2025. We’ll look at what’s driving global shipping today, from shifting trade routes and new technologies to the growing pressures of geopolitics and climate goals, and what all of this means for the future of trade.

Let’s start with the big picture.

Growth amid volatility

After the pandemic shock, maritime trade has bounced back, but not quite the way it used to. In 2024, global seaborne trade reached 12.7 billion tons, up 2.2% from the year before. That’s slightly above the average growth of the past decade but well below the boom years of the early 2000s. In other words, shipping recovered, but the long-term trend points to slower, more uneven growth. UNCTAD expects trade to rise by just 0.5% in 2025, essentially flat.

Why the slowdown? Global trade faces a tricky mix of headwinds: weak demand, persistent inflation, and tighter financial conditions. Even the WTO projects that overall merchandise trade will grow barely 0.1% this year.

Beyond short-term shocks, there’s a deeper story: the link between global trade and GDP is weakening. Economies are growing, but each unit of GDP now generates less cross-border trade than before. That’s why shipping volumes aren’t surging even as recoveries take hold.

And yet, volatility remains the defining feature. Think about it: trade collapsed in 2020, roared back in 2021, slowed again with the Ukraine war, energy crisis, and inflation in 2022–23, and then was disrupted once more by the Red Sea crisis. These stop-start cycles make life hard for shippers and ports, which swing between capacity crunches and quiet docks.

Here’s a fascinating detail from the UNCTAD report: in 2024, while total trade volume rose 2.2%, shipping output in ton-miles jumped nearly 6%. That means ships were sailing farther on average—a direct effect of longer detours and rerouted trade. So even modest growth in trade can mean much higher demand for shipping if supply chains stretch out. But if routes shorten again, the same ships could suddenly be in excess supply.

For now, those longer voyages are keeping ships busier and freight revenues higher. The question is, what happens when the world’s sea lanes normalize?

Geopolitics redrawing the map of trade

Not since the Suez Canal crisis of the 1960s has the geography of global shipping been this disrupted.

Geopolitical tensions and climate shocks are literally redrawing the world’s sea routes, forcing ships to take longer, costlier detours.

Take the Red Sea. It’s one of the most important arteries of global trade, linking Asia and Europe through the Suez Canal. But since late 2023, escalating conflict around the region has made it too risky for many vessels to pass through. By May 2025, traffic through the Suez Canal had dropped almost 70% from 2023 levels. Instead, ships began sailing thousands of extra miles around Africa’s southern tip—the Cape of Good Hope.

The Panama Canal has faced its own crisis, not from war, but from climate. A historic drought lowered water levels and forced authorities to restrict the number of ships passing through in 2024. Between the Red Sea and Panama disruptions, vessels were suddenly traveling much longer routes, causing massive delays and driving up costs.

The numbers tell the story. While total trade volume in 2024 grew just 2.2%, total shipping output in ton-miles jumped nearly 6%. Container ships saw an even sharper rise,

up almost 19%.

In short, the same cargo now needed more ships and more sailing time to move. That kept freight markets tight, even without a surge in trade volumes.

But there’s a trade-off. Longer voyages mean higher fuel and insurance costs, more emissions, and slower deliveries. According to UNCTAD, global shipping emissions rose 5% in 2024, partly because of these extended detours.

And it’s not just the Red Sea or Panama.

The war in Ukraine has completely reshaped energy routes. Russian oil that once flowed to Europe now travels on longer-haul voyages to Asia, while Europe imports oil from the U.S. and the Middle East instead. That “shuffle” has pushed up average voyage distances for tankers.

Meanwhile, tensions around the Strait of Hormuz, which handles 11% of world maritime trade and over a third of all seaborne oil, continue to keep the world on edge. The flare-up between Iran and Israel in mid-2025 sent tanker freight rates soaring due to rising war-risk premiums.

Even trade policy is reshaping shipping lanes.

In 2025, the U.S. introduced new tariffs and proposed port fees on certain foreign-built or -operated vessels. These measures are still evolving, but they could change how global fleets are deployed and which ports they frequent.

All this is driving a deeper shift in how supply chains are organized. Companies are diversifying production and sourcing, moving away from over-centralized models. We’re already seeing stronger export growth from Southeast Asia—countries like Vietnam, Thailand, and Indonesia—as well as from India and Mexico.

ow, it’s important to separate what’s temporary from what’s structural.

Some of these detours, like the Red Sea reroutes, will probably end when security improves. But others may be here to stay. Climate-driven water shortages, like those at the Panama Canal, could become more frequent. And geopolitical rivalries aren’t going anywhere. That means global shipping might have to stay permanently more flexible, adapting to an era of shifting trade corridors.

The impact of all this isn’t shared equally.

For businesses, longer routes mean higher logistics costs and more uncertainty.

For policymakers, it highlights the need for secure trade corridors and better regional connectivity. And for consumers, it often translates into higher prices for imported goods.

But the harshest impact falls on developing countries, especially small island and landlocked nations. As UNCTAD’s foreword puts it:

“Small island developing States watch their import bills soar while their export competitiveness erodes. Landlocked developing countries sometimes pay transport costs three times the global average, and that gap widens with each disruption.”

In other words, the great rerouting of global trade isn’t just a story about ships and canals. It’s a story about how distance, politics, and climate are reshaping the cost of being connected to the world.

Container shipping: Navigating new routes and capacity shifts

If you’ve ever seen those giant ships stacked high with colorful containers, you’ve seen the workhorses of global trade.

Container shipping keeps the world’s supply chains running, moving everything from electronics to furniture to clothing in standardized steel boxes that make global trade possible.

But after a wild few years, this sector is now in the middle of a reset, adapting to new trade routes, new partnerships, and a lot of uncertainty.

Let’s start with how trade routes themselves are changing.

The big East–West corridors, connecting Asia with Europe and North America, still dominate global container traffic. But growth is shifting elsewhere. South–South trade routes like Asia–Africa, Asia–Latin America, and intra-Asia were the most dynamic in 2024. As developing economies industrialize and trade more with one another, we’re seeing more direct shipping links between these regions.

This isn’t just about new markets; it’s also about resilience. Shippers are deliberately diversifying routes and building more flexible supply chains to avoid dependence on any single chokepoint or trade lane. In other words, global trade is learning to hedge against shocks.

Now, the industry side of the story.

After the pandemic, container lines made record profits as freight rates hit historic highs. From 2021 to 2022, they went through what UNCTAD calls a “cash-flow boom.” Carriers used that windfall to order a wave of new, larger ships.

Those vessels are now being delivered just as demand growth is slowing. In 2024, total container shipping capacity jumped nearly 10%, the biggest annual increase since 2008, raising fears of too many ships chasing too little cargo. When that happens, freight rates usually fall.

And rates have indeed been swinging wildly.

The Red Sea crisis in early 2024 sent them soaring close to pandemic peaks. By the end of the year, they had cooled, but they stayed well above pre-crisis levels. Then, in the first half of 2025, they spiked again, this time because exporters rushed to ship goods ahead of possible tariff changes and amid rising geopolitical risks.

The report sums it up neatly: trade policy uncertainty, new domestic shipbuilding programs, and shifting alliances are making this one of the most volatile periods in container shipping history.

Speaking of alliances, the industry map is being redrawn.

The long-standing 2M alliance between Maersk and MSC ended in 2025. Maersk joined Hapag-Lloyd to form the new Gemini Cooperation, while ONE, HMM, and Yang Ming created the Premier Alliance.

Meanwhile, MSC, now the world’s largest carrier, has decided to go solo.

These new partnerships aim to match capacity with shifting trade flows, but they’re also causing short-term confusion for shippers about routes, schedules, and reliability.

So where does that leave the industry?

The container sector is coming down from the extreme highs of 2021–22 and entering a more balanced but uncertain phase. Fleet capacity is growing faster than trade volumes. Routes are becoming more diverse. Alliances are reshaping.

UNCTAD expects containerized trade to keep expanding, though at a slower pace than fleet growth. For businesses, that could mean lower freight costs than in the boom years, but also more volatility as carriers adjust.

Energy cargoes: fossil fuels down, gas up

The makeup of what the world ships by sea is changing—and nowhere is that more visible than in the energy trade. For decades, bulk energy cargoes like oil and coal dominated maritime shipping. Today, decarbonization goals and geopolitics are reshaping those flows, some changes temporary, others structural.

Let’s start with coal.

Despite the global shift toward cleaner energy, coal remains a heavyweight in dry bulk shipping. In fact, 2024 saw a 3.3% jump in seaborne coal trade, reaching its highest level since 1980. The main reason? Strong demand from Asia—especially China and India—and industrial stockpiling by several importers.

But as UNCTAD points out, this is a “temporary rebound” rather than a comeback. In the long run, coal’s share in maritime trade is flattening out, while gas and cleaner fuels slowly gain ground. The center of gravity has decisively moved eastward: European and North American imports are shrinking, and Asia now dominates both demand and trade routes.

That means longer voyages, for instance, coal shipments from Colombia or Russia traveling farther to reach Asian ports. Yet, even with occasional demand spikes, the broader trend is clear: a gradual decline in coal’s role as climate policies tighten over the coming decade.

Oil tells a similar story: long-term pressure from the energy transition, but short-term turbulence from geopolitics. In 2024, seaborne crude oil shipments fell by 1.5%, and refined petroleum products slipped 0.7%, extending a pattern of stagnant growth seen since 2010. But interestingly, ton-miles, which measure both cargo and distance, rose: up 1.6% for crude and 6.5% for refined products.

Why? Because the war in Ukraine and related sanctions have forced a massive reshuffling of routes. Europe has cut pipeline imports from Russia and is now buying oil from the U.S. and the Middle East, while Russia sends its barrels east to Asia.

So even though less oil is moving overall, ships are sailing much farther. Tanker markets stayed firm in 2024, not at the wild peaks of 2022–23, but still profitable thanks to those longer hauls. And new players like Brazil and Guyana are emerging as exporters, driving even more long-distance shipments to Asia.

Then there’s liquefied natural gas, or LNG, the most dynamic fossil fuel in maritime trade right now.

Often seen as a “bridge fuel” in the energy transition, LNG has become central to global energy security. In 2024, LNG trade volumes rose 1.1%, but ton-miles surged a massive 12.2%. That means much longer voyages, from Africa and the U.S. to Asia and Europe, as new export terminals came online in both regions.

UNCTAD expects this momentum to continue in 2025 as more liquefaction capacity ramps up. The LNG fleet is growing fast, with a record order book and new routes forming as the U.S. joins Qatar and Australia among the top exporters.

And beyond these fuels?

There’s already talk of hydrogen and ammonia as potential clean-energy cargoes of the future. But for now, UNCTAD notes, they’re more relevant as alternative ship fuels than as major traded commodities.

Critical minerals

For most of the 20th century, oil was the world’s “strategic commodity.” In the 21st, a new set of materials is taking that title—critical minerals. These are the metals that power clean energy and high-tech industries; think about lithium, cobalt, nickel, copper, and more. They’re what make electric-vehicle batteries, wind turbines, solar panels, and smartphones possible. And as demand for all these products soars, seaborne trade in these minerals has surged, turning ships into the new arteries of the green economy.

The report calls this one of the defining shifts of our time. Asia, and especially China, has become the central destination for many of these minerals because that’s where most of the processing and manufacturing happens. Meanwhile, Africa, Latin America, and Oceania are the main sources. Think copper from Chile and Peru, cobalt from the DRC, bauxite from Guinea, and nickel ore from Indonesia almost all flowing toward Asia.

But here’s the catch: production and trade are highly concentrated.

The report notes that global trade in critical minerals “remains concentrated in a handful of exporters,” which makes supply chains vulnerable to both political and logistical shocks. One striking example: in 2023, the DRC accounted for more than 80 percent of all seaborne cobalt exports. That level of dependence mirrors the old reliance on a few oil producers decades ago.

Naturally, this has set off a geopolitical scramble. Importing countries are racing to secure supply.

The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act and the EU Critical Raw Materials Act both aim to diversify sources and expand domestic processing. On the other side, resource-rich countries are asserting more control, imposing export restrictions, as Indonesia has done for nickel, or adding local-content rules to keep more value at home.

For maritime trade, this means bigger cargo volumes and new routes. UNCTAD reports steady growth in seaborne shipments of bauxite, nickel ore, manganese ore, and copper concentrates, mostly carried by bulk carriers.

Strategically important lanes now link Africa, Latin America, and Australia with Asia’s industrial centers, above all, China. If you trace copper and cobalt flows on UNCTAD’s maps, Asia clearly sits at the heart of this new network.

Is this shift temporary? Hardly.

UNCTAD’s projections show global demand for these energy-transition minerals could nearly triple by 2030 and quadruple by 2040. That means decades of expansion in mining, processing, and, crucially, shipping.

While recycling and technology might ease the pressure later, the near-term reality is clear: the ocean trade in critical minerals is entering a long-term growth phase. And just like oil once did, these materials are already reshaping alliances, with countries forging new strategic partnerships around minerals to secure their place in the clean-energy supply chain.

Decarbonizing the fleet

Even as ships carry the materials needed for the world’s green transition, the shipping industry itself faces one of its toughest challenges yet: decarbonization.

Maritime transport is incredibly efficient for moving huge amounts of cargo, but because of its sheer scale, it’s still a major emitter. Big ships burn fossil fuels, and the sector accounts for about 3% of all global emissions. UNCTAD calls this “the gap between ambition and reality”, a gap the industry now has to close.

And it’s not getting easier. In 2024, shipping emissions rose about 5%, partly because vessels had to take longer routes and sail faster to meet delivery schedules. Meanwhile, more than 90% of the global fleet still runs on conventional fuels. Only 8% can currently use cleaner alternatives.

To change that, regulators are moving fast. In July 2023, member states of the International Maritime Organization adopted a climate strategy aiming for net-zero emissions from shipping by around 2050, with interim goals for 2030. Then, in April 2025, the IMO’s environment committee approved draft measures under a new Net-Zero Framework, a global system that combines technical and economic tools to drive change.

Here’s how it works:

First, a fuel standard: ships will need to reduce the greenhouse gas intensity of the fuel they use over time.

Second, a pricing mechanism: ships that exceed emissions targets will have to buy “remedial units,” contributing to a new Net-Zero Fund, while cleaner ships could earn rewards. That fund would then help finance innovation, port infrastructure, and a just transition for developing countries.

So, what does a low-carbon future look like at sea?

It won’t be one single fuel or technology, but a mix. LNG is already being used as a transition fuel, making up over a third of all new ship orders in 2024. Methanol is gaining ground quickly, while ammonia and hydrogen are seen as the next generation of zero-emission fuels, though technical and safety hurdles remain. At the same time, efficiency improvements—better hull design, slow steaming, smarter routing, and even wind-assist technologies—are helping ships burn less fuel.

The orderbook shows how fast the industry is pivoting.

As of May 2025, more than half of all ships on order, about 53% by tonnage, are being built to run on alternative fuels. But this creates a “zero-carbon fuel dilemma.” Ships last 20 to 30 years, and no one knows which future fuel, be it ammonia, hydrogen, or something else, will win. That uncertainty makes it challenging for shipowners to commit today.

Existing regulations are also tightening. Since 2023, measures like the Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index (EEXI) and the Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII) have forced ships to meet efficiency benchmarks. Those that don’t must either slow down or retrofit—both of which affect costs and capacity.

And if the IMO’s carbon-pricing plan is approved, operating costs will rise further for high-emission vessels, giving shipowners another reason to go green.

But going green won’t be cheap. UNCTAD estimates annual investment needs between $8 and $28 billion for new or retrofitted ships and an additional $30 to $90 billion a year for onshore infrastructure, things like green-fuel production, storage, and port refueling systems. Many older ships will likely be recycled, converted, or replaced in the coming decade as the fleet turns over.

In short, the decarbonization of shipping is no longer a distant goal; it’s a massive industrial transformation already underway. And while the road to zero-carbon seas will be long and costly, the direction is now set: global shipping is finally starting to clean up the cargo that makes the world go round.

Ports and People

Maritime trade isn’t just about ships and cargo. It’s also about the ports and the people that keep this massive system running. The last few years have stress-tested both, pushing ports to become smarter l and more efficient while also reminding the world just how vital human labor is to global trade.

Ports are where sea meets land, and they’ve been under pressure. Even in 2024, congestion was rising. UNCTAD data show that the average vessel waiting time increased from 5.2 to 6.4 hours in developed countries and from 10.2 to 10.9 hours in developing ones. Those few extra hours may not sound like much, but across thousands of ships, they ripple through the entire supply chain, adding costs and delays that businesses and consumers ultimately feel.

To fix this, ports are going digital. Tools like Maritime Single Windows and Port Community Systems are transforming how information flows—allowing ships, customs, and port authorities to exchange data electronically instead of relying on paper or siloed systems. This means faster cargo clearance, smoother vessel scheduling, and more predictable turnaround times. UNCTAD’s data even show that ports using these systems tend to score higher on logistics and trade facilitation indicators. Automation, from yard cranes to container tracking, is speeding things up even further.

But digitization brings new risks. As ports become more connected, they also become more vulnerable to cyberattacks that can cripple operations.

Then there’s the human side of the story. Ports depend on people, and the workforce itself is evolving. There’s been progress on gender diversity; in 2024, women held 39% of management and administrative roles in reporting ports. But in hands-on operational jobs like cargo handling, that figure drops to just 2%. Automation could help change that by making physically demanding roles more accessible, but it’ll take active policy support to close the gap.

At sea, the situation is even more urgent. The industry faces a growing seafarer shortage, worsened by the tough conditions exposed during the pandemic. The report highlights that protecting seafarers’ rights, fair treatment, shore leave, repatriation, and safe working conditions under the Maritime Labor Convention is essential to attract and retain skilled crews. Without them, global trade literally stops.

As automation advances and autonomous ships edge closer to reality, the kinds of maritime jobs will change. Some traditional roles may disappear, but new ones, in technology, data, and remote operations, will emerge. Managing this transition fairly, through training and upskilling, is key to keeping the system both efficient and humane.

Digitalization and human welfare now sit side by side as priorities. “Smart ports” using data, AI, and IoT are becoming the norm, enabling faster, cleaner, and more reliable trade flows. And international frameworks, from the IMO’s Facilitation Convention, which mandates digital port systems, to the WTO’s Trade Facilitation Agreement, are pushing for universal adoption, especially in developing countries that risk being left behind.

Looking ahead

Maritime trade has always been called a barometer of the global economy, sensitive to every breeze or storm. And right now, it’s sailing through both: short-term turbulence and long-term transformation.

The challenge is knowing which is which.

Structural shifts are the deep, lasting changes: a slower pace of global trade, new routes shaped by emerging markets, the reshaping of energy cargoes as the world goes green, the rise of critical minerals, and the twin revolutions of decarbonization and digitalization within shipping itself. These are the forces that will define maritime trade for decades to come. To stay ahead, shipping lines might focus on high-growth routes in the Global South, invest in dual-fuel vessels, or build expertise in moving new cargoes like critical minerals.

Meanwhile, cyclical forces, like geopolitical uncertainty, will keep testing the system. The trick is to stay resilient enough to ride out those waves without losing sight of the horizon. A port might expand and digitize, but it also needs contingency plans for sudden disruptions. A shipping company might enjoy a temporary freight spike, but if it rushes to order too many new vessels, it risks repeating an old mistake and being caught in the next downturn.

Ultimately, maritime trade isn’t just about ships or cargo; it’s about connection. It reflects how economies rise, adapt, and endure through change. If the industry can stay steady through today’s turbulence, it won’t just weather the storm; it’ll help steer global trade toward a more resilient and sustainable future.

The IMO Net-Zero Framework was designed as a key step in the United Nations’ efforts to tackle climate change by targeting one of the world’s most polluting sectors — global shipping. If adopted, the framework would have required vessels to drastically cut emissions by switching from fossil fuels to greener alternatives such as renewable energy-based fuels and wind-powered systems.

The framework also proposed a pricing system for shipping emissions, often described as a carbon levy, which would have encouraged investment in cleaner technologies while funding climate adaptation in developing nations, including Small Island Developing States (SIDS) like Saint Lucia.

A sudden shift in course

The measure was expected to pass easily during the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC)’s meeting in October, following months of negotiations and a breakthrough in April 2025. However, optimism faded when the United States’ White House issued a public statement on October 10, calling the proposed emissions pricing “an unsanctioned global tax regime” that would place “unfair burdens on shipping and the American people.”

The United States’ rejection of the proposal prompted immediate reactions from other major players. The European Union reiterated its support for the deal, while the IMO’s Secretary General Arsenio Dominguez urged countries to act “in good faith” and maintain a united front in combating climate change.

But behind closed doors at the IMO’s London headquarters, negotiations began to unravel. With Saudi Arabia and Russia joining the US in opposition, the once strong coalition in favour of the deal began to splinter.

In a surprise move, Saudi Arabia proposed an adjournment of the meeting for one year, effectively halting progress on the framework. The motion passed with 57 countries voting in favour, 49 opposing, and 21 abstaining.

The decision means the framework, and any formal commitment to reducing shipping emissions, will now be delayed until at least October 2026, when the committee reconvenes.

Island nations left at anchor

The postponement has significant implications for small island nations that are already facing the brunt of climate change. St. Lucia Times understands that the majority of SIDS had initially expressed support for the framework, viewing it as an important step towards securing climate financing and promoting sustainable maritime trade. However, following opposition from major economies, some island states reportedly backed away from endorsing the deal amid uncertainty over its financial implications.

Neighbouring St Vincent and the Grenadines publicly confirmed its decision not to support the proposed framework. Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves argued that while his country remains committed to tackling climate change, the proposed measures could place additional strain on small, import-dependent economies.

“While we are committed to addressing climate change, international regulations must recognise the unique vulnerabilities of economies like ours,” Gonsalves said, warning that compliance penalties and increased shipping costs could ultimately “be transferred to consumers, potentially destabilising fragile economic ecosystems.”

The Bahamas and Antigua and Barbuda, both of which agreed to the deal’s terms in April, were two countries that abstained

For Saint Lucia, the government’s official position on the matter remains unclear. However, regional observers note that small island nations are often placed in difficult positions during such global negotiations. They are forced to balance their commitment to climate action with the economic realities of their dependence on maritime imports and exports.

Charting the next course

Although the NZF has been delayed, work on its technical guidelines will continue later this month when the IMO’s Intersessional Working Group on Greenhouse Gas Emissions meets to refine the framework’s implementation strategies.

Climate policy experts say that while the adjournment represents a setback, the year-long pause could allow for renewed dialogue between developed and developing nations — provided that consensus remains the ultimate goal.

For the Caribbean, and for Saint Lucia in particular, the delay highlights a familiar challenge: the struggle to have the voices of small and climate-vulnerable nations heard in global decision-making arenas.

Oct 24, 2025 (Bloomberg) –US Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum floated the concept of storing natural gas produced in Alaska’s North Slope and shipping it directly from there, a proposal he said has drawn interest from unnamed foreign investors.

“It could be a second project, just tapping into that gas field and figuring out a way to move it out by ship,” Burgum said Friday during remarks at an event held by the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, a Washington nonpartisan research institute.

Shipping the gas would require the fuel to first be liquefied through an export facility, which requires billions of dollars to build. Icy North Slope conditions would most likely make it difficult to construct an export plant there, though Burgum said there are months at a time when there is a path through the ice.

The planned Alaska LNG project currently under development includes a new pipeline about 800 miles (1,288 kilometers) long that would deliver the gas from the North Slope to an export facility in Nikiski, Alaska, as well as the residential area of Anchorage, which is facing a decline in domestic gas. The plant would have a capacity of 20 million metric tons per year.

Developer Glenfarne Group is leading the Alaska LNG project. A spokesperson for Glenfarne did not immediately respond for requests for comment on the possibility of shipping gas from the North Slope directly.

The long-proposed Alaska LNG project has been pitched for decades and revived under the Trump administration. The state of Alaska has a stake in the current project along with Glenfarne, through the Alaska Gasline Development Corp.

Burgum last told reporters this week that the front-end engineering and design study for the project, including the pipeline, was still underway and could be finished by December. A formal decision to move forward with Alaska LNG has not yet been made.

The plan, which was designed to set a unified global standard for decarbonizing international shipping.

Originally introduced in April 2025, the framework aimed to create the world’s first industry-wide carbon pricing mechanism and establish a global approach to cutting greenhouse gas emissions at sea. Supporters, including the European Union, China, and the United Kingdom, called it a critical step toward climate accountability and regulatory clarity.

However, fierce opposition led by the United States, Saudi Arabia, and Russia derailed the vote. Washington labeled the proposal a “green tax” that would harm trade and consumer interests, while other nations warned it could undermine competitiveness. Behind the scenes, delegates described days of intense lobbying and diplomatic pressure, making it clear the measure lacked the support needed for adoption.

The final count saw 57 countries favoring a delay and 49 opposing it. IMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez acknowledged disappointment but urged members to continue working toward consensus. U.S. officials, meanwhile, celebrated the result as a major win.

We will continue to champion maritime decarbonisation, backed by nearly $F1 billion investment through UK SHORE – a program to address maritime emissions and create skilled jobs — and our Maritime Decarbonisation Strategy.","AS COP30 approaches next month, the urgency of climate action is intensifying. But for Pacific islanders, it is a daily reality — one that shapes lives, communities, and futures.

The struggle is not theoretical. It is personal, immediate, urgent, and often painful.

Over recent months, I’ve had the privilege of travelling across the Pacific and hearing firsthand stories of resilience and adaptation.

In the Western Division of Fiji, communities spoke of rising floodwaters and the damage they cause — to homes, crops, and livelihoods.

In Tuvalu, I saw coastal erosion up close, where land reclamation projects are not just infrastructure, but acts of survival.

In Kiribati, infrequent rainfall is making access to water more difficult, straining families and public services.

And in Kadavu, I witnessed mangrove planting — a quiet but powerful response to the creeping loss of coastline.

These experiences have stayed with me. They speak to the difficult decisions Pacific communities are making every day. My message is simple: you are not alone.

In the UK, we recognise that fossil fuels and a carbon-intensive future are the root drivers of climate change – and the consequences are already being felt across the Pacific.

These are not just technical shifts, but moral choices. Every tonne of carbon avoided and every clean energy investment made helps ease the burden on communities already living on the frontlines of this crisis.

That’s why actions like phasing out coal and accelerating decarbonisation matter.

On October 1, Great Britain completed 12 months coal-free in our energy infrastructure – a landmark moment in our journey to a fossil-free future.

The closure of Ratcliffe-on-Soar, our final coal-fired power station, came a year ahead of schedule. In just a decade, coal’s share of electricity generation in Great Britain fell from around a third to zero.

According to the World Resources Institute, this is the second-fastest coal power phase-out in the world.

The UK has also cut emissions by 50 per cent between 1990 and 2022, becoming the first major economy to do so, while growing and diversifying our economy.

This transition has not been easy. It has required tough decisions by successive British governments and the British public. But it reflects our national commitment to decarbonise our power sector by 2030 and to become a clean energy superpower. We are investing in renewables, supporting clean energy jobs, and sharing our journey with international partners.

Great Britain’s coal-free milestone is especially significant given our history.

We were the first country in the world to burn coal for electricity. Coal powered our Industrial Revolution and shaped our economy for generations.

But today, our actions are helping build a coal-free world.

In 2015, the UK became the first national government to commit to phasing out unabated coal, setting a target date of 2025.

This is part of a wider trend: the UK leads globally through the Powering Past Coal Alliance, which now includes 180 members across every continent.

The UK’s International Climate Finance (ICF) program — representing a commitment of over $F30 billion — is delivering real impact across the globe. Since its launch in 2011, it has helped more than 100 million people adapt to the effects of climate change and provided nearly 70 million with improved access to clean energy.

It has contributed to the reduction or avoidance of over 86 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions, protected more than 413,000 hectares of forests and ecosystems, and mobilised £14 billion in climate finance, equally split between public and private sources.

Globally, coal power remains the largest source of energy-related CO₂ emissions. The latest data shows coal capacity is still rising – by 2 per cent last year, reaching 2,130GW. One major economy opens two coal-powered stations a week. However, to keep 1.5°C within reach, we need to retire an average of 126GW of coal capacity per year – roughly two coal plants every week – for the next 17 years.

That’s why the UK recently stood firmly behind the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) Net Zero Framework (NZF) — a landmark proposal to decarbonise global shipping by incentivising cleaner fuels and aiming for net-zero maritime emissions by 2050.

Approved in principle earlier this year, the NZF was a major step toward aligning the sector with the Paris Agreement and sending a clear signal to industry that the age of fossil-fuelled shipping is ending.

At the IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) meeting last week, however, the Framework’s adoption was postponed by at least one year. Despite this, the UK stood alongside our Pacific Island partners in support of the NZF’s immediate adoption. We remain committed to advancing the Framework and building consensus. We will continue to champion maritime decarbonisation, backed by nearly $F1 billion investment through UK SHORE – a program to address maritime emissions and create skilled jobs — and our Maritime Decarbonisation Strategy.

My visit to Tuvalu concluded with a fatele ceremony – a communal performance by one island community, where the steady pulse of central drumming set the rhythm for dancers encircling them to rise in tempo and intensity.

As the movement and sound built to a unified crescendo, it stirred an almost involuntary urge among those watching to take part (I’m pleased to say I did!). It was more than a cultural moment; it was a living metaphor for the kind of collective global effort we need to confront climate change — with the Pacific at its heart and a call for all to join in.

The UK is listening and acting. As we look ahead to COP30 in Brazil and the exciting prospect of a Pacific COP at COP31, the UK is proud to support Pacific priorities on climate, including decarbonisation. Our own coal-free milestone — marking 12 months without coal-fired power — is our moment to step into the global choreography of climate action. It reflects our commitment to a fossil-free future and our belief that climate action must be shared, sustained, and deeply felt.

The tempo is rising. The world must respond – together.",https://www.fijitimes.com.fj/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-25-174431.png,N,,2025-10-25 15:16:29.879869

It is unclear what the diplomatic consequences of the postponement will be on the vote for the Net Zero Framework.
Will pressure from the United States and other fossil fuel-producing countries succeed in further weakening the work of countries in favour of decarbonising maritime transport over the next year?
And what influence will the United States' threats to not only states, but also their officials have?","The Net Zero Framework (NZF) is the International Maritime Organisation's (IMO) plan for decarbonising the maritime transport sector, aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20-30% by 2020 and achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.

Tentatively approved last April with 63 states in favour and 16 against, the NZF was due to be formally adopted yesterday, Friday 17 October, on the last day of the second extraordinary session of the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC/ES.2), opened on 14 October at the IMO headquarters in London.

Yet the United States, with the support of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Singapore and other countries, managed to prevent its adoption through threats and an attempt to change the procedural rules, which, if passed, could have proved to be a trap that would have effectively blocked its adoption indefinitely.

Throughout the week, the most important flag states, those with the largest number of registered ships and which transport the largest quantities of goods, remained silent. However, according to Lloyd's List, the states representing well over 50% of global tonnage have changed their position since April. At that time, they were in favour of adopting the NZF. Now, many have decided to abstain or vote against its adoption. The IMO meeting therefore ended with 57 states in favour (49 against) of postponing the vote on the adoption of the NZF until next year.

Threats and attempts to change procedural rules

In the months and weeks leading up to the meeting, the United States threatened tariffs and retaliation against countries that supported the plan. On 10 October, in a joint statement, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright and Secretary of Transport Sean Duffy reiterated the threats, and indicated that the United States was prepared to take retaliatory measures against officials from the various states. Retaliation could include blocking ships flying the flags of those countries in US ports, placing restrictions and fees on visas, and imposing sanctions on officials who, according to Rubio and Duffy, “support climate policies promoted by activists.”

As reported by Lloyd's List, the United States has also sought to block the adoption of the Net Zero Framework by proposing a change to the procedural rules, calling for a shift from “tacit” to “explicit” acceptance, which would make it easier to block the plan.

Since 1973, the decision-making system within the IMO has been one of tacit acceptance: that is, an amendment to the MARPOL Convention enters into force 10 months after its formal adoption by the MEPC, unless one-third of the parties to the MARPOL Convention, or countries representing 50% of the world's gross tonnage, object.

Explicit acceptance, on the other hand, requires that after formal adoption, at least two-thirds of the contracting governments must write to the IMO to confirm their acceptance. As reported on the IMO website, the explicit acceptance process “is time-consuming and most amendments adopted in this way have never entered into force”. The Net Zero Framework was developed with the tacit acceptance system in mind, and switching to explicit acceptance at this stage of the process would effectively ensure that it would never enter into force.

Most countries, led by Denmark, Canada, Australia, Kenya and some EU states, urged the MEPC to maintain tacit acceptance. Brazil, which will host COP30 on climate change in December, defended the NZF and tacit acceptance, accusing the United States of threatening multilateralism, condemning the use of “methods that should never be used between sovereign nations” and adding that “we hope this will not replace negotiations as the normal way of making decisions.”

India also defended implicit acceptance, while, according to Lloyd's List, China's position was more ambiguous, as on Tuesday it expressed support for the NZF but on Wednesday seemed to lean towards explicit acceptance.

On Friday, Singapore, previously in favour of the NZF, proposed that nations postpone the vote until next year. The proposal was supported by Saudi Arabia, which, along with other fossil fuel-producing countries, has opposed the Net Zero Framework since the beginning of the discussions.

The European Union has split

The European Union normally votes as a united front at the IMO and, in the case of a vote on the adoption of the NZF, should have supported it with a yes vote. However, according to observers, three of its major maritime states, Greece, Cyprus and Malta, were considering abstaining from the vote during the week. This news was later debunked by Malta.

Yet, during the vote on Singapore's motion to postpone the vote on the adoption of the NZF until next year, according to Lloyds List, Greece and Cyprus abstained, violating EU rules and reflecting the strong concerns of their maritime industries about the increased costs of using fossil fuels.

“Crucially, the EU must continue to strengthen its own green shipping ambitions and retain its own maritime policies which now stand as the only substantive regulations to tackle shipping emissions in the void left by the IMO NZF,” said the NGO Transport & Environment in a press release after the meeting, according to which “Bold regional action is still possible with or without the US.”

Reactions from NGOs and observers

“Adoption through explicit ratification of the current amendments leads to delays and prolonged uncertainty that could last for years or decades,” warned the World Shipping Council, pointing out that this kind of uncertainty is what prevents shipping companies from making the green investments needed to achieve the IMO’s decarbonisation goal.

“By delaying adoption of its Net Zero Framework, IMO has today squandered an important opportunity to tackle global shipping's contribution to climate breakdown,” claimed John Maggs, representative of the Clean Shipping Coalition at the IMO. “However, all is not lost – not by a long shot, as there is an immediate opportunity to slash GHG emissions from shipping, minimise fuel burn and the overall cost of the energy transition and that is to strengthen and make enforceable the Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII), the IMO’s cornerstone energy efficiency measure. There's no time to waste, at MEPC 84 April 2026 member states need to focus all their attention on transforming the CII into the energy efficiency powerhouse needed to quickly right this ship and put it back on route to being a climate solution.”

“The collapse of MEPC talks and the one-year delay in adopting IMO’s Net Zero Framework aren’t just procedural, we all know they’re political,” said Eman Abdalla, Strategic Advisor in the Global Maritime and Supply Chain, on the outcome of the meeting. “What’s at stake isn’t the headline target for 2050, it’s the credibility of the transition itself. The more we delay operational, scalable measures, the more we will pay later; financially and environmentally. Leadership in shipping must now shift from conference rooms to companies, cargo owners, and financiers who can move faster than politicians.”

“Although the Net-Zero framework is far from perfect, its adoption would have been an important step in maintaining the IMO’s commitment and in sending important signals to an industry that not only demanded a global framework but actively supported this agreement,” Maggs added.

According to Bloomberg, the delay in voting could represent a setback for climate diplomacy and multilateral environmental regulations ahead of next month's COP30 climate summit in Brazil.

“We are not conducting climate negotiations here, but geopolitical negotiations,” said Faig Abbasov, director of the maritime sector at the NGO Transport & Environment, speaking from the sidelines of the talks. “The United States is waging war on multilateralism, UN diplomacy and climate diplomacy, at this meeting, inside the building and outside.”

“The delay leaves the shipping sector drifting in uncertainty. But this week has also shown that there is a clear desire to clean up the shipping industry, even in the face of US bullying”, added Alison Shaw, IMO manager at Transport & Environment. “The world cannot let intimidation and vested interests dictate the pace of climate action. Climate-ambitious countries must use this moment to build a strong majority in support of meaningful decarbonisation. They will be the ones that benefit from the economy of tomorrow, not the geopolitical power games of the past.”

What is going to happen now?

It is unclear what the diplomatic consequences of the postponement will be on the vote for the Net Zero Framework. Will pressure from the United States and other fossil fuel-producing countries succeed in further weakening the work of countries in favour of decarbonising maritime transport over the next year? Or will the European Union and other states in favour of the NZF be able to find alternative ways forward?

And what influence will the United States' threats to not only states, but also their officials have? Will they be intimidated after seeing the results of US sanctions against the UN rapporteur for human rights in the occupied Palestinian territories, Francesca Albanese, who cannot even open a bank account or carry out financial transactions in any country?

And what to make of the suggestion from Australian billionaire Andrew Forrest, advocate of stricter global regulations to halt climate change, who sent IMO delegates a letter stating that he is “ready to support any country or individual being blackmailed or threatened”? “You are not alone,” Forrest added. “I am committed to working with others to ensure that justice prevails and bullying tactics do not win out.” Are we really in a world where sovereign states need to be protected by billionaires in order to develop regulations against climate change?",https://www.renewablematter.eu/assets/Uploads/64-glistatiunitihannobloccatolE28099adozionedelnetzeroframework_ballerini54853114232_eb89758999_k.jpg,N,,2025-10-25 08:56:13.634223

Two floating LNG units (FLNGs) were ordered by Mexico’s Amigo LNG at Dubai Drydocks in the United Arab Emirates.
Hanwha placed two LNGC orders under its own account in July and August, marking the first LNG carrier orders in the United States since the 1970s.
As of September 2025, South Korean shipyards held 65% of the global LNG orderbook, while Chinese yards accounted for 33%.
Drewry Maritime Research is a division of Drewry Group, a UK-based maritime consultancy that provides market analysis, research, and advisory services across shipping sectors including LNG, containers, and offshore.","Global orders for liquefied natural gas (LNG) vessels have dropped sharply in 2025, according to Drewry Maritime Research. Only 38 vessels were ordered in the first nine months of the year, compared with 86 in the same period of 2024—a 56% decline.

The orderbook-to-fleet ratio has continued to weaken, pressured by higher deliveries and low new orders. Drewry attributed the slowdown to delayed final investment decisions (FIDs) in 2024 and early 2025, high newbuild prices, and increased uncertainty stemming from the U.S. Section 301 trade measures, as well as stricter environmental rules such as the EU Emissions Trading System and FuelEU Maritime.

By the end of the third quarter of 2025, only 17 LNG carriers (LNGCs) had been ordered, compared with 73 in the same period last year.

In contrast, LNG bunker vessels (LNGBVs) have seen stronger demand, with 19 orders placed. Two floating LNG units (FLNGs) were ordered by Mexico’s Amigo LNG at Dubai Drydocks in the United Arab Emirates.

Drewry forecasts that total orders for 2025 will reach about 50 vessels, down from 96 in 2024, with the global orderbook currently at 335 vessels and an orderbook-to-fleet ratio of 41%. The consultancy expects further weakening until new orders recover, likely starting in 2026.

Ordering activity showed signs of recovery in the third quarter.

Nine LNGCs were ordered, surpassing the eight placed in the first half of the year.

Hanwha placed two LNGC orders under its own account in July and August, marking the first LNG carrier orders in the United States since the 1970s. These vessels will be partly built in South Korea and completed and flagged in the U.S. The decision is viewed as a strategic response to the U.S. Trade Representative’s Section 301 requirement that 1% of U.S. LNG exports be carried on U.S.-built and -flagged LNG carriers, a costly condition given the estimated $250 million per vessel price.

As of September 2025, South Korean shipyards held 65% of the global LNG orderbook, while Chinese yards accounted for 33%. No LNGC orders have been placed at Chinese shipyards this year, reflecting market uncertainty caused by U.S. trade regulations and potential port fees targeting Chinese-built vessels. However, Chinese yards have secured 58% of LNGBV orders.

Drewry noted that while 2025 marks a downturn, investments are expected to accelerate from 2026 due to rising LNG project approvals, expanded shipyard capacity, and the need to replace aging fleets.

Drewry anticipates continued demand for LNGBVs and small-scale LNGCs through 2030, driven by the expansion of LNG-fuelled fleets—projected to exceed 1,000 vessels by 2027—and growing bunkering infrastructure. The firm cautioned, however, that high newbuild costs, regulatory uncertainty, and the International Maritime Organization’s pending Net-Zero Framework may influence the pace of recovery.

“While last week’s delay was unwelcome, it’s only a postponement, not the end of the NZF,” said Delaine McCullough, CSC President. “At this week’s ISWG meeting, IMO member states engaged constructively in preparing implementation guidelines. This shows broad support for the NZF and signals that progress is still possible.”

The Net-Zero Framework aims to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from shipping in line with the IMO GHG Strategy. Key elements include:

Global Fuel Standard (GFS): Gradually limits the greenhouse gas emissions per unit of energy in ship fuels, considering full fuel life-cycle emissions.

GHG Pricing Mechanism: Encourages the shipping industry to reduce emissions in alignment with the GFS.

John Maggs, CSC representative at IMO, noted, “Member states won’t have to wait a year to tackle shipping’s climate impact. At MEPC 84 in April 2026, they can strengthen the Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII), the IMO’s core energy efficiency tool. Enhancing the CII can bring shipping climate action back on course quickly.”

Dr Alison Shaw, IMO Manager at Transport & Environment, added: “Even with the adoption pause, negotiations advanced on implementation guidelines. Success will depend on guidance that both incentivizes green e-fuel production and prevents unsustainable fuels with hidden environmental impacts.”

Andrew Dumbrille, Co-Founder and Director of Equal Routes, emphasized: “IMO member states must consider environmental, human, health, social, and Indigenous Peoples’ rights in shaping the full marine fuels pathway. Despite the delay, work continues to create a just path for the shipping sector to meet 2050 net-zero goals.”

Anaïs Rios, Senior Shipping Policy Officer at Seas At Risk, highlighted wind propulsion’s potential: “The Net-Zero Framework may be delayed, but support for wind propulsion is growing. Governments must ensure guidelines enable its global adoption—it reduces fuel costs, cuts emissions, and keeps shipping competitive.”

Jenny Helle, Carbon Market Watch, said: “The shift toward cleaner fuels and technologies is already underway. Rolling back ambition now would slow maritime decarbonization.

A crucial meeting of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) held in London between October 14-17, was expected to adopt a landmark deal: the Net-Zero Framework, a global mechanism to price carbon emissions from ships and use the proceeds to help developing countries transition to green shipping. Instead, after four days of tense and acrimonious negotiations, the decision was deferred for a year.

The setback marks a turning point in global climate governance. What began as a technical discussion on emission standards turned into a geopolitical tussle. Oil producing nations, led by Saudi Arabia, mounted a vigorous campaign against the framework, while the United States openly warned of trade retaliation, investigations, regulations, financial penalties, sanctions and port restrictions on ships owned, operated, or flagged by countries supporting the framework, if the agreement passed.

In the end, the proposal to suspend adoption by a year was passed by a narrow 57–49 vote–halting progress on a deal that could have been the first truly global carbon-pricing regime in any industry.

The Net-Zero Framework was no reckless “global tax,” as its opponents alleged. It was a carefully designed system, backed by detailed assessments by the IMO, UNCTAD, and the World Maritime University, showing that developing nations would be net beneficiaries. The plan proposed a Net-Zero Fund–financed by carbon levies on ships–to channel billions into developing countries through grants, technology transfer, and capacity-building. The intent was clear: those with the ability to pay would contribute, and those with the greatest need would receive support to modernize their fleets, ports, and fuels.

Advt

For India, the framework represented not a cost, but an opportunity. As an oil-importing, developing economy with rising ambitions in green shipbuilding, alternative fuels, and ship recycling, India stood to gain significantly. A global carbon price would have spurred demand for low-emission vessels, giving Indian shipyards a competitive edge under the government’s ₹69,725 crore maritime development program cleared by the Union Cabinet in September. The credit-note scheme, a key plank of the programme, linking ship recycling at Alang in Gujarat to new ship orders could have gained early traction, with older vessels being retired sooner under stricter emission norms.

Equally important, the framework would have strengthened India’s plans to become a hub for green hydrogen and ammonia–fuels seen as key to the decarbonisation of shipping. By pricing fossil fuels higher, the framework would have narrowed the cost gap between conventional and green fuels, driving investment and offtake.

India, with its low-cost renewable potential and ongoing National Green Hydrogen Mission, was well placed to capture this market. Now, with the delay in finalising a deal at the IMO, that demand signal has weakened, and regional mechanisms–such as Europe’s Emissions Trading System for shipping–will dominate the early market. Europe’s scheme is expected to raise over €10 billion annually, revenues that could have instead contributed to a shared global fund for developing nations.

Fragility of multilateralism

The broader fallout, though, lies in what this episode reveals about the fragility of multilateralism. The IMO, long viewed as a model of consensus-driven rulemaking, was shaken by power politics and procedural brinkmanship. The United States’ hardball tactics–threatening to ignore any global carbon price and penalise those who supported it–were described by observers as unprecedented in a UN agency. For many smaller islands and African states, the outcome felt like a betrayal of global cooperation.

India’s role in this moment of reckoning was particularly crucial. Just a few months ago, India supported the Net-Zero Framework, recognising its balance between ambition and equity. This time, however, it chose caution –aligning with the delaying bloc. While the reasoning may have been diplomatic prudence, the optics were unfortunate. When much of the Global South looked to India for leadership, New Delhi’s silence left a vacuum. Brazil and South Africa, by contrast, stood firmly for adoption and were seen as voices of equitable climate action.

The consequences for India go beyond the maritime domain. The country’s aspiration to lead the Global South and to be a bridge between developed and developing nations depends on its ability to combine moral leadership with pragmatic action. Supporting a measure that embedded fairness and finance for developing countries would have strengthened that claim. Instead, India’s neutrality at a defining moment may be construed as retreat.

In the end, the IMO’s delay is not just about ships or carbon. It is about the direction of global governance itself. The oceans connect us all, and the decisions taken–or postponed–in one conference room can shape the future of industries, economies, and nations. For India, the choice is stark: to drift with the tide of hesitation or to steer with purpose toward a cleaner, fairer maritime future.

But while the United Nations has backed off for now, the measure will be on the table again sometime next year.
It will also block voluntary U.S. contributions to the United Nations if the organization levies a carbon tax on shipping.","The United States earned its independence by fighting a war to protest various indignities imposed by the crown, including levies that prompted the colonist slogan ""taxation without representation."" Those at the United Nations seeking to implement a global money grab through shipping taxes might be wise to re-examine history.

Last week, the U.N.'s International Maritime Organization tabled a proposal to create a global tax on carbon emissions derived from international maritime activity. The plan, which would raise up to $15 billion annually, was hatched by European nations and Brazil under the guise of fighting global warming by getting the maritime sector down to ""net zero"" by 2050. Three percent of climate change, the IMO maintains, is attributable to global shipping.

But the proposal met fierce resistance from President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans. Trump threatened to retaliate against countries that supported the tax and to withhold U.S. funding from the United Nations if it enacted the plan. In advance of the tabled vote, the president took to social media to declare that the United States would ""not stand for this global green new scam tax on shipping and will not adhere to it in any way, shape or form.""

Good. The tax would represent a massive drag on global commerce and would burden American consumers with billions in higher costs despite never having been approved by any of their elected representatives in Washington. Taxation without representation, indeed. The net-zero pipe dream is an economic albatross that undercuts markets in favor of bureaucratic central planning and has already crippled the European Union. Trump did the Europeans a favor, saving them from themselves.

But while the United Nations has backed off for now, the measure will be on the table again sometime next year. Enter Rep. August Pfluger, a Texas Republican, who proposes legislation to ensure that the United States not be subject to a U.N. tax or penalty unless the Senate approves such a measure. It will also block voluntary U.S. contributions to the United Nations if the organization levies a carbon tax on shipping.

""This legislation,"" Rep. Pfluger told Fox News last week, ""would kill their global carbon tax scheme permanently by depriving all U.S. funding to any U.N. agency that attempts to impose a tax on the American people and ensuring Congress has a say in all taxes, fees and penalties on American citizens or companies.""

Rep. Pfluger's legislation protects Americans from overreaching U.N. bureaucrats. Congress should pass his bill once the government shutdown ends.",https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/static-4/teaser_images/www.newstribune.com_default.jpg,N,,2025-10-25 08:56:49.898472

These vessels, which account for approximately 85 percent of the international shipping industry’s carbon dioxide emissions, would be required to meet annual GHG fuel intensity targets or offset excess emissions through banked credits, purchases from other ships, or contributions to a new IMO Net-Zero Fund. The framework aligns with the IMO’s 2023 Strategy on Reduction of GHG Emissions from Ships, aiming for a 40 percent reduction in carbon intensity by 2030 and net-zero emissions close to 2050.

The Postponement and Increasing Political Pressures

The IMO’s most recent extraordinary MEPC session ended without adoption of the IMO Net-Zero Framework after a motion to adjourn proposed by Saudi Arabia, which passed by a narrow margin of votes. The adjournment followed heightened political pressure and shifting positions among key Member States, including vigorous opposition by the Trump administration. On October 10, 2025, days before the extraordinary MEPC session, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, and Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy issued a Joint Statement “unequivocally reject[ing]” the IMO Net-Zero Framework and encouraging other nations to reject the adoption of the new measures at the then-upcoming session.[1] Although the Trump administration’s stance on the measures does not come as a surprise, given that U.S. delegates exited the April session early and did not participate in the vote, the Joint Statement goes so far as to threaten retaliatory actions against nations that supported the measures at the October extraordinary MEPC session, including:

“Pursuing investigations and considering potential regulations to combat anti-competitive practices from certain flagged countries and potential blocking vessels registered in those countries from U.S. ports;

Imposing visa restrictions including an increase in fees and processing, mandatory re-interview requirements and/or revisions of quotas for C-1/D maritime crew member visas;

Imposing commercial penalties stemming from U.S. government contracts including new commercial ships, liquified natural gas terminals and infrastructure, and/or other financial penalties on ships flagged under nations in favor of the [IMO Net-Zero Framework];

Imposing additional port fees on ships owned, operated, or flagged by countries supporting the framework; and

Evaluating sanctions on officials sponsoring activist-driven climate policies that would burden American consumers, among other measures under consideration.” [2]

According to news reports of the extraordinary MEPC session, several countries that had previously backed the measures, and approved the IMO Net-Zero Framework in April 2025, abstained or changed their votes. EU members Greece and Cyprus, home to major shipping fleets, abstained. China, the world’s largest shipbuilder, switched from supporting the measure in April to voting for the delay. Other opponents included major fossil fuel producing countries, such as Saudi Arabia and Russia, many of which have argued that the IMO Net-Zero Framework sows global division and overlooks the potential economic impacts on citizens and economies. Major shipping nations such as Singapore and Liberia also objected.

The criticism of the framework focuses primarily on lack of sufficient supply for clean fuels that would meet the IMO Net-Zero Framework’s GHG intensity targets. Currently, while cooking-oil derived maritime fuels have the potential to meet the framework’s targets, supply constraints mean that these fuels will not be available in sufficient quantities to meet projected demand, raising the risk of financial penalties that could ultimately drive up consumer costs in an era of persistent inflation. When coupled with pressure from certain groups to exclude soy and palm-oil based maritime fuels from the framework, until costs come down for the production of e-fuels, some countries and groups see significant compliance challenges in the near-term. Similarly, although the IMO Net-Zero Framework incorporates a credit-purchasing system as a compliance pathway, recent studies call into question the availability of these credits to meet demand given the limited ability to bank credits for future years and the lack of fuels capable of meeting the IMO’s GHG intensity targets. Additionally, while the framework contemplates investment in port modernization/electrification and supporting low carbon fuel production using funds generated from the credit system, projected revenues do not appear sufficient help scale next generation low carbon fuels for the shipping industry at this time.

What to Watch Ahead of 2026

Despite the adjournment, technical work on the IMO Net‑Zero Framework continues. The Intersessional Working Group on the Reduction on Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Ships is expected to continue developing detailed guidelines for implementing the IMO Net-Zero Framework. The guidelines were originally expected to be approved at the 84th session of the MEPC in Spring 2026, but it is not clear whether the Intersessional Working Group is still working towards that goal. Over the next year, Member States are expected to pursue consensus-building, and the extraordinary session is set to reconvene around October 2026. If adopted at that time, the IMO Net-Zero Framework could still potentially enter into force for reporting year 2028, though this timeline is now uncertain.

The one-year delay is likely to amplify the existing uncertainty for the shipping industry, as there will be increased pressure from nations opposed to the measures to abandon or roll back the measures as previously approved. On the other hand, with global efforts on pause, there is increased risk of incremental or overlapping regional regimes to address GHG emissions from shipping. Stakeholders should monitor developments that could advance independently during the adjournment and consider potential interactions with any future IMO mechanism.

We will continue monitoring developments related to the proposed framework. Please reach out to your Vinson & Elkins team to discuss these matters and their implications for your business.

“While last week’s IMO decision to delay its Net Zero Framework was unwelcome, let’s be clear - this is just a postponement and not the end of the NZF”, said Delaine McCullough, Clean Shipping Coalition president. “During this week’s ISWG meeting, IMO member states have constructively engaged in preparing the guidelines that will be necessary once the NZF is adopted. This indicates broad support for the NZF and that progress can still be made on preparing for implementation.”

The IMO’s Net-Zero Framework is aimed at reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from ships, in line with its GHG Strategy. The NZF includes a global fuel standard (GFS), requiring ships “to gradually reduce how polluting its ship fuel can be (i.e. how much greenhouse gas is emitted for each unit of energy used, across a fuel's life cycle)”. It also includes a mechanism for setting prices on the GHG ships emit, to encourage the shipping industry to lower emissions as per the global fuel standard.

“IMO member states also don’t have to wait a year for the NZF to tackle shipping’s contribution to the climate crisis. At the IMO’s MEPC 84 meeting in April 2026 they will get a chance to slash GHG emissions and the cost of the energy transition by strengthening the Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII), the IMO’s cornerstone energy efficiency measure”, said John Maggs, Clean Shipping Coalition’s Representative at IMO. “By transforming the CII into an energy efficiency powerhouse, the IMO and its member states can quickly get shipping climate action back on course.”

“While adoption of the IMO Net-Zero Framework was paused last week, negotiations this week advanced on the implementation guidelines nonetheless”, said Dr Alison Shaw, IMO Manager at Transport & Environment. “The framework’s success will hinge on strong, coherent guidance that both incentivizes long-term green e-fuel production and use, and safeguards against unsustainable fuels with uncaptured environmental impacts. Many member states acknowledged the importance of both aims, though uncertainty over the framework’s eventual adoption remained a clear backdrop to discussions.”

“This week's meeting signaled that IMO member states will inevitably need to account more comprehensively for not only potential environmental harms but also human, health, social, Indigenous Peoples Rights and community well being of the full well to wake marine fuels energy pathway”, said Andrew Dumbrille, Co-Founder and Director of Equal Routes. “Despite the implementation delay of the IMO's GHG framework, work continues in earnest to create a just and equitable path for the shipping sector to meet its 2050 net zero ambitions.""

“Wind propulsion is back in the spotlight at the IMO this week, with countries voicing support and industry data strengthening the case”, said Anaïs Rios, Senior Shipping Policy Officer, Seas At Risk. “The Net Zero Framework may be delayed but the work hasn't stopped, and when adoption comes next year, implementation can be quick. Governments must now ensure that these guidelines enable a global scale up of wind propulsion: One of the few solutions that cuts fuel bills, slashes emissions and keeps shipping competitive. The technology is here, now the rules need to catch up.”

“The global shift toward cleaner shipping fuels and technologies is already happening“, said Jenny Helle, Expert on Decarbonisation of Aviation and Shipping at Carbon Market Watch. “Scaling back ambition at this critical moment would risk slowing the momentum needed to achieve meaningful progress in maritime decarbonisation. This week, the IMO member states have shown support for the development of clear, enforceable, and science-based guidelines, robust life-cycle emissions accounting, a reward scheme for clean fuels and technologies, as well as revenue distribution to support the transition in small island developing states and least developed countries.”",http://img.scoop.co.nz/stories/images/1908/scoop_image.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 23:16:31.836241

Back in the day, about the only time you would come across a robustly and publicly displayed America First message would be when traveling rural, mostly southern highways, when suddenly from the trees would pop out a brightly lettered John Birch Society call to action: “Get US Out of the United Nations!”

If only we had listened. Back then such a proposition was considered to be as far out of the mainstream as the back roads along which the pop-ups appeared, but in recent years the idea has become serious currency, especially in the America First movement. As well it should. Grassroots conservatives across America understand in their guts and hearts the dangers the United Nations and its affiliate organizations pose to the United States and to liberty.

The problem is, even though the imperatives of nationalism travel these days along slick silicon interstates rather than homesteading along abandoned rustic roads, our political leaders, including more than a few conservatives, continue to blink and miss them. It is as if they are driving blindfolded, or have fallen asleep, on their way to one global political crisis after another.

That they need to wake up—it’s always dangerous to drive with your eyes closed—was underscored just this past week when the Trump administration had to undertake a full court press to derail a UN globalist carbon tax that would have devastated the country’s shipping industry and imposed severe costs upon American consumers, all without any input from U.S. citizens.

The Wall Street Journal called it the ultimate taxation without representation, a levy imposed without any democratic accountability. It is just the latest but quintessential example of how the UN frustrates and defeats national sovereignty; how it commits our nation to a redistribution of wealth away from its own people; how it ties the hand of future voters and their elected representatives; how it confiscates our hard-earned dollars at will.

It is the latest demonstration of why the United States needs to get out of the UN immediately, and to run in the opposite direction as fast as it can.

The Shipping News

Let’s get to all that by first examining the specifics of the now-postponed (for one year) carbon tax on shipping vessels.

For the past several years and possibly longer, the U.N.’s International Maritime Organization (IMO) has worked diligently to erect a so-called “Net-Zero Framework” that would effectively impose a global tax on fossil-fuel emissions from ocean shipping—the first ever across an entire sector—complete with remedial payments into a central fund.

Its architects have celebrated it as a necessary piece of climate housekeeping and, as late as last week, expected the IMO’s governing body to enact it. The ostensible idea was to decarbonize the shipping industry by requiring all oceangoing ships exceeding 5,000 gross tonnage to track their emissions using a Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII), which measures the amount of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions per unit of used energy.

Ah, the old Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII), that will get you every time. Specifically, starting in 2028, large international vessels would have had to use a fuel mix containing much less carbon or get tagged for $100 per ton or $380 per ton of CO2 emissions. The gross-tonnage threshold would have covered vessels responsible for roughly 85 percent of the international shipping industry’s CO2 emissions. Ships meeting a direct-compliance target would have escaped the levy altogether; those falling between a base and direct-compliance target would have been charged $100 per ton, while non-compliant vessels faced a $380-per-ton penalty.

Bottom line, the IMO expected to collect $10-$12 billion per year for a Net-Zero Fund for various green energy investments.

Now this is where it all gets kind of wacky, or murky, or shady—one of those ‘y’ words. Proponents of the IMO strategy will tell you otherwise, that the fund use is highly regulated and use of the funds strictly delineated, but in fact the use of the central fund was loosely defined, meaning bureaucrats could, in the IMO’s own words, invest in new low-emission ships, upgrade port infrastructure, support island states threatened by rising sea levels, or support—wait for it— “just transition initiatives in developing countries.”

Wealth redistribution that they could use for just about anything, if I may translate the last permitted use. As Secretary of State Marco Rubio put it on X, it would have been a slush fund for “progressive climate pet projects.”

As might be expected, the scheme did not get past one Donald J. Trump, who wrote on social media:

Rubio, Duffy, and Wright cited estimates forecasting global shipping costs to rise by 10 percent or more because of the carbon tax.

“The NZF (Net Zero Fund) proposal poses significant risks to the global economy and subjects not just Americans, but all IMO member states to an unsanctioned global tax regime that levies punitive and regressive financial penalties, which could be avoided,” the secretaries continued. “The United States will be moving to levy remedies against nations that sponsor this European-led neocolonial export of global climate regulations. … Our fellow IMO members should be on notice.”

Neo-colonial was a nice touch, by the way, though I prefer regulatory imperialism, not to split hairs.

Member states did blink after the administration’s missive. The IMO punted—delaying action for a year after a motion to adjourn carried on a tight vote, with 57 countries supporting the delay, 49 opposed, and 21 abstaining.

Unfortunately, the pattern of the entire scheme was a familiar one. A global body constructs an elaborate revenue scheme in the name of climate, development, or justice; costs flow to wealthier developed nations; power accretes to the bureaucracy; and the world’s largest payer—the United States—is asked, yet again, to fund its own sacrifice to the globalist gods. It should be pointed out, too, that estimates performed in 2024 show that the emissions reductions that would have been achieved by 2030 were well short of the IMO’s target of 20 percent; the most reliable estimate was 8 percent. This after massive revenue extraction from American consumers.

And that tells us all we need to know about the motive for the tax. But don’t take my word for it. A 2024 analysis of low-carbon fuels by World Economic Forum strategic partner Deloitte Global explained it all: “Reaching net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 requires a fundamental transformation of society, from its current fossil fuel-centric model to an efficient, highly renewable and electrified energy system.”

This is exactly how globalism works in the modern world. It identifies an existential world-wide crisis; concocts an elaborate supranational mechanism to exploit it; and then treats democratic resistance as a moral failure. The effect—intended—is to make national sovereignty look small-minded and backward, even selfish, while elevating rule by acronymic bodies you never voted for and cannot abolish.

Even worse, the shipping tax isn’t a one-off; it’s the role model. Cue the aviation industry next.

Forever yours, my lovely forever wars

What all this points out is that UN action, by default, is an intrusion on sovereignty. It does not represent agreements negotiated between nations by the people’s elected representatives but rather ideological edicts dreamed up by unelected bureaucrats, rubber-stamped by ambassadors of the global elite.

The intent is to bind nations to a global chassis in which decision-making migrates away from voters and toward international bodies, “experts,” and permanent institutions. The only sovereignty is the sovereignty of those permanent institutions. These insentient and corporatized bureaucracies do not just tax but, through redistribution, come to own and control the wealth of the world. The compilation of their visions into holy screeds of international “frameworks” and “treaties” is the only vote-counting that matters.

There is another vital consequence of this, one so often overlooked: The era of the United Nations is also the era of Forever Wars, and that is no coincidence. According to Uppsala/PRIO data, the number of active state-based conflicts reached 59 in 2023 involving 34 countries and 61 in 2024—the highest since records began in 1946—underscoring how the post-1945 UN era features more simultaneous conflicts than earlier decades. UCDP is a highly credible program of Uppsala University in Sweden that tracks organized violence, while the Peace Research Institute Oslo (PRIO) is an independent research organization that compiles reports on such things as global conflict trends.

The history of the UN, which was created to keep the international peace, is a history of violent bloodshed and unleashed military industrial complexes, not to mention brutal civil wars. The hegemony of the international power structure might have reduced interstate conflicts, at least until recently, but globalization and the destabilization of the nation-state promoted intrastate warfare mercilessly.

In the end, there’s a simple test for any institution that claims to keep the peace: Does it keep the peace?

The United Nations has spent eight decades proving that it can’t, and it admits it. Just recently, the United Nations chief sharply criticized the powerful but deeply divided UN security council for its failure to end wars in Gaza, Ukraine, Sudan and more: “Peace demands action,” secretary-general Antonio Guterres told the 15-member council charged with ensuring international peace and security. “And peace demands leadership. Instead, we’re seeing deepening geopolitical divisions and mistrust.”

Far from taking action, UN groupies sing karaoke against a backdrop of international ballads of justice while warmongers paralyze any and all international tribunals for peace. Meanwhile, wars multiply, and American taxpayers pick up the bar tab. The truth is, the best deterrence to war is the existence of strong sovereign nations with their own national interests to protect and that are not cowed by fear of ridicule or admonishment by others. On the other hand, the international bureaucratization of governance breaks down the checks and balances that strong sovereign nations provide against the consolidation of international power.

More recently, there is another reason globalism does not deter but fuel war—it has now concentrated power in a globalist class that seeks hegemony over the world but does not have it. They are other globalist power cliques who seek the same domination, namely Russia and China and their allies, and they are the competition against Brussels and Davos.

That contest explains the Russia-Ukraine war as much as anything, along with the Biden regime’s weak submission to globalist dictats and provocations. While individual nations are no longer allowed under international “frameworks” to march to the beats of their own drummers, either for defense or for war, they are expected to engage on the front lines immediately when the globalist regime comes calling.

Trump’s speech was a defense of sovereignty and borders, a rejection of the “green energy scam,” and a reminder that deterrence—power responsibly wielded by accountable governments—stops violence in ways that war-crime tribunals and security council vetoes never can. In his speech Trump laid out for the assembled puppecrats what a truly sovereign nation—what a strong leader committed to sustaining that sovereignty—can accomplish.

“America is blessed with the strongest economy, the strongest borders, the strongest military, the strongest friendships, and the strongest spirit of any nation on the face of the earth,” Trump said. “This is indeed the Golden Age of America.”

Four months in a row, the president said, the number of illegal aliens admitted and entering the U.S. had been zero.

“In a period of just seven months, I have ended seven ‘un-endable’ wars,” he said. “No president or prime minister, and for that matter, no other country, has ever done anything close to that. It’s too bad that I had to do these things instead of the United Nations doing them—and sadly, in all cases, the United Nations did not even try to help.”

Trump—and all of us—know exactly what the UN thinks its purpose is: to fund an assault on our countries and our way of life. And so he drilled down finally to the real evil:

“The entire globalist concept of asking successful, industrialized nations to inflict pain on themselves and radically disrupt their entire societies must be rejected completely and totally, and it must be immediate.”

Sadly, the accounts payable for all this keeps rising. Earlier this year, the Pew Research Center ran the numbers. In 2025 the United States accounted for about 22 percent of the U.N.’s regular budget—roughly $820 million of a $3.5 billion net total—and more than 26.2 percent of the so-calledpeacekeeping budget. China was the next-largest contributor to the regular budget, Japan a distant third.

One hundred seventy-five member states each pay under 1 percent of the regular budget. So when American taxpayers express skepticism about underwriting institutions that scold our allies, cuddle our adversaries, and demand that we fund our own demise, that skepticism is not isolationism, it is a desire for survival.

It is a demand for liberty.

The need for a united nation—no ‘s’

Trump has indeed signaled his withdrawal from important parts of the globalist infrastructure in his nine months back in office.

The president has signed an executive order to initiate U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Climate Accord and the WHO, and in February 2025 he issued an order directing the government to reevaluate its commitment to three major U.N. bodies: the UN Human Rights Council (from which the U.S. will withdraw), UNESCO (which will be reviewed), and UNRWA (to which U.S. funds will be cut).

America First congressional leaders have also honed in on the UN and its affiliated organizations. This past year, for example, Wisconsin’s own U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany, now a candidate for governor, has been one of the clearest voices pushing hard against U.N. overreach, especially through the World Health Organization. His “No WHO Pandemic Preparedness Treaty Without Senate Approval Act” would force any WHO agreement to win a Senate supermajority approval, putting treaty power where it belongs.

Tiffany has also pushed to revisit our World Trade Organization membership.

“The WTO has repeatedly overlooked China’s unfair trade practices and human rights abuses, undermined American farmers and manufacturers, and eroded our national sovereignty,” Tiffany said. “American trade policies should be made by American officials who are elected by American voters and accountable to American workers, not dictated by unelected international bureaucrats in Geneva. It’s time to pursue a better approach to trade—one that puts American industry, jobs, and economic independence first.”

Amen, brother.

Behind all the numbers is a political truth: the people of the United States are fed up with funding a system that undermines American sovereignty while failing to achieve its advertised goals, even though our leaders appear not so courageous.

Of course all of America First knows what the next step needs to be, and that is complete withdrawal from the UN, precisely because cutting off its limbs—IMO, WTO, WHO—will never slay the beast if its heart is left to beat another day. In January, U.S. Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) introduced the Disengaging Entirely from the United Nations Debacle (DEFUND) Act of 2025, in essence a bill seeking a divorce decree based on irreconcilable differences.

“No more blank checks for the United Nations,” Lee said. “Americans’ hard-earned dollars have been funneled into initiatives that fly in the face of our values, enabling tyrants, betraying allies, and spreading bigotry,” Lee said.

Elon Musk, appointed by President Donald Trump to downsize the US government, has also publicly supported US withdrawal.

So where does that leave us? Well, with a straightforward policy program.

First, end the insanity. Withdraw from the United Nations and its affiliate dependent agencies, as Lee’s DEFUND bill would do. Second, build real alliances with other sovereign nations through concrete agreements designed and approved by elected officials. The difference between a treaty ratified by the Senate and a “framework” imposed by a U.N. body is the difference between democracy and authoritarianism. Tiffany’s WHO approach gets this exactly right.

Third, defend borders, and build energy security and industry at home. We must reject an environmentalism that transfers power from voters to bureaucrats, and from free economies to commanded ones.

Trump’s U.N. speech asked one of the right questions: What is the purpose of the United Nations? We all knew what the honest answer was. But the shipping-tax fight brings to light an even more important question for all Americans to consider:

What is the purpose of a sovereign United States?

We all know the answer to that, too. It is to protect our liberty and values and culture, and, by being strong, to keep the peace. Sovereign strength deters, and only sovereign strength delivers longevity.

The unity of nations was always a misnomer, double-speak for the unified power of an elite. What we need is the unity of a nation, not in policy but in purpose. The map to get there is out there on a rural road somewhere, faded but visible yet on an aging but still-standing sign calling us to action: Get the U.S. out of the United Nations!

We can still make that sign proud.",https://www.maciverinstitute.com/assets/components/phpthumbof/cache/united-nations-seal.542bbc6eb4cf186158fda16aaf5af3cb.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 21:56:10.413980

From fuel discussions to wind propulsion demonstrations, maritime training showcases and Clean Maritime Day exhibitions, University of Southampton and SMMI colleagues took part in a diverse programme of activity at LISW25. They represented the University, sharing research and building connections across the maritime community. Their presence throughout the week reflected the University’s growing role in shaping sustainable shipping, from advancing technical innovation to contributing to national and international policy discussions.

Powering Maritime Innovation

On Tuesday, 16 September, Professor Alan J Murphy delivered a keynote at Powering Maritime Innovation: Towards a UK Research Roadmap, highlighting key UK maritime research challenges and the importance of coordinated innovation. Alan also gave closing remarks as MarRI-UK Academic Chair, stressing the role of international collaboration in supporting the transition to net-zero shipping

That evening, Professor Mark Spearing , Vice-President of Research and Enterprise, represented the University of Southampton at the Investment Reception hosted by His Majesty’s Government, in partnership with Maritime UK, at Mansion House. The event brought together industry leaders, institutional investors, Government Ministers, and international ambassadors to celebrate the UK maritime sector’s contribution to economic growth.

Hydrogen Fuel for the Maritime Sector

On Wednesday, 17 September, Panos Manias represented the SMMI at MarRI-UK’s event on hydrogen as a clean maritime fuel. Panos explored hydrogen’s potential in decarbonising shipping and enabling next-generation uncrewed systems.

That same day, Panos also joined industry and policy leaders at the ShipZERO30 – HyWindships conference at the International Maritime Organization (IMO). Hosted by the Zero Emissions Ship Technology Association (ZESTAs), the event focused on real-world progress toward zero-emission shipping, bringing together innovators advancing hydrogen, electrification, and wind propulsion technologies.

Later that evening, Panos and Professor Stephen Turnock represented the University at the Maritime Innovation Networking and Drinks event hosted by ACUA Ocean in partnership with the University of Southampton and MarRI-UK. The gathering at St Katharine Docks showcased ACUA Ocean’s hydrogen-powered autonomous vessel, the USV Pioneer, and offered guests a close-up look at emerging technologies redefining clean, crewless operations at sea.

Solent: A Global Centre for Maritime Training and Skills

Also on 17 September, Maritime Solent hosted the Solent – A Global Centre for Maritime Training and Skills session, attended by Rosemary Nunn, Head of Industry Relations at the University of Southampton. The event highlighted the Solent region’s unique maritime training ecosystem and its collaboration between universities, colleges, and industry.

The launch of the new Solent Prospectus showcased this global leadership in maritime excellence, featuring institutions such as the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, National Oceanography Centre, Royal Navy, Lloyd’s Register, and the University of Southampton.

Wind Propulsion and Clean Maritime Day

On Wednesday afternoon, Professor Dominic Hudson and Dr Joe Banks attended the Wind Propulsion Session hosted by the Royal Institution of Naval Architects and the International Windship Association. With more than 160 delegates, the event underscored the growing momentum behind wind-assisted propulsion and the UK’s leadership in developing the technologies that will drive its adoption across global fleets.

On Thursday, 18 September, SMMI engineers and collaborators showcased the Winds of Change project at Innovate UK’s Clean Maritime Day, as part of the Smart Green Shipping exhibition. Visitors to Stand 11 explored sustainable wind propulsion technologies and engaged with industry leaders on low-carbon shipping innovations. We were pleased to discuss the potential of wind propulsion technology with the new shipping minister, Keir Mather , and to show him our wind tunnel exhibit.

It was good to see the University’s logo on at least two other stands and to talk with all of our industry partners about past and future projects.

The event also highlighted the role of public investment and policy in accelerating the clean maritime transition, with updates from the Department for Transport and Innovate UK on UK SHORE and the Maritime Decarbonisation Strategy.

Advanced Fuels and Future Concepts

Throughout LISW25, University of Southampton representatives engaged with sessions on alternative fuels, including focus on ammonia as a marine fuel and the ÆQUORIS roundtable on zero-emission LH2-powered ocean liners. These discussions focused on technical feasibility, regulatory frameworks, and collaboration opportunities for long-range sustainable shipping.

The discussions around hydrogen, ammonia and future vessel concepts underscored a central challenge: how to test and de-risk new fuels and technologies at scale, quickly enough to meet net zero targets. That is precisely the gap the University of Southampton is addressing through its recently announced Centre for Green Maritime Innovation (cGMI). Bringing together industry, regulators and researchers, the cGMI is being established to enable full-scale trials and accelerate the adoption of clean technologies.

By linking technical breakthroughs with real-world deployment, the centre will play a critical role in ensuring the UK can lead the global race to decarbonise shipping - an ambition that ran throughout London International Shipping Week.",,N,,2025-10-24 19:16:36.242517

The meeting is a key technical-negotiation forum for IMO’s process to develop and finalize mid- and long-term measures to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from international shipping.

Following the heated Net-Zero Framework debate the previous week, the meeting carried an unmistakable buzz. Then Erik Hjortland entered the stage and caught the attention with a clear message: the pathway to net-zero shipping is already within reach.

Real results from real operations

Odfjell’s chemical tanker Bow Olympus completed a transatlantic voyage earlier this year, powered by a dual propulsion solution: suction sails on deck, 100% waste-based, ISCC-certified biofuel meeting both IMO and the EU’s sustainability criteria in the bunker tanks.

The goal was to demonstrate the GHG reductions possible by utilizing options available here and now. The results might have surprised even the most hardcore optimists at Odfjell: it achieved a 20% consumption reduction due to the sails, and 85% reduction in well-to-wake greenhouse gas emissions due to the sustainable biofuel.

A scalable pathway

Scalability-wise, our VP Technology referred to DNV's 2023 research, which estimates a sufficient availability of sustainable biomass beyond 2050—for all sectors, including shipping. The supply estimates are cross-checked with 26 other reliable and credible sources, which show that DNV's predictions are quite conservative. The significance of this pathway is that it does not require capex, and as such, one can argue that the entire shipping fleet today is net-zero capable.

We have reduced the carbon intensity of our fleet by 54% since the 2008 benchmark through systematic efficiency improvements, including retrofitting of more than 140 energy-saving devices such as propeller upgrades, hull optimization, propeller ducts, LED lights, and sails. These measures have not only reduced emissions but also generated annual fuel cost savings of USD 20-30 million.

In contrast, 67% of the world fleet has not installed a single energy-saving device (according to Clarkson Research, 2024), leaving an enormous untapped potential for further emission reductions in the industry—and cost savings.

“We cannot energy-efficiency ourselves to zero, but we can get very far, very fast—and sustainable biofuels and wind power can take us the rest of the way,” Erik said. “With 10,000 tonnes of sustainable biofuel bunkered this year and more to come, we’re not just talking —we’re doing.”",https://st-484u2x1fcj.nf.cdn.netflexapp.com/media/l/1200x630/1761306646/5044-cd605195-9591-4d64-a640-5dec10ced726.JPG,N,,2025-10-24 18:00:35.671824

Governments also discussed the IMO Net-Zero Fund, which experts say must be equitable to ensure climate-vulnerable countries are not left behind in the transition.
“Many member states acknowledged the importance of both aims, though uncertainty over the framework’s eventual adoption remained a clear backdrop to discussions,” Shaw said.
IMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez encouraged leaders to view the delay as a pause on adoption, not on the underlying work.","The International Maritime Organization continued work on its Net-Zero Framework at working group talks in London this week, despite voting to postpone the framework’s adoption by one year just days earlier.

The NZF contains the world’s first global greenhouse gas pricing system for shipping, i.e. a carbon tax, designed to help the industry achieve its 2023 Revised Strategy goals of achieving net zero emissions by or around 2050. The framework’s carbon pricing revenues are expected to reach up to $15 billion annually from 2030.

The ISWG-GHG-20 meeting saw governments engage in discussions on the framework’s guidelines, a contrast to the chaotic negotiations the week before that led to the adoption delay.

Countries disagreed sharply on the role of biofuels in shipping’s transition. Brazil, Indonesia and several African countries pushed for a “technology neutral” approach favoring existing biofuel sources including food and feed stock like soy and palm oil. The EU and Pacific Island states opposed this position, citing sustainability and scalability concerns, and favored renewable e-fuels as a long-term solution.

Researchers, civil society groups and international campaigners have warned against using food and feed-based biofuels on environmental, climate and human rights grounds. Mexico, the UK and several Pacific Islands expressed support for addressing these concerns through Life Cycle Assessment guidelines that account for indirect land-use change emissions. The LCA guidelines are set to be finalized in April 2026.

Member states and industry expressed broad support for including wind propulsion as a zero- or near-zero energy source alongside solar and shore power.

Governments also discussed the IMO Net-Zero Fund, which experts say must be equitable to ensure climate-vulnerable countries are not left behind in the transition.

The US, Saudi Arabia and other oil-producing countries objected to further work on the guidelines, calling it premature until the NZF is adopted. Several delegates noted that these same countries had argued the previous week that the NZF could not be adopted due to missing policy clarifications.

Dr. Alison Shaw, IMO Policy Manager at T&E, said the framework’s success will depend on strong guidance that incentivizes green e-fuel production while safeguarding against unsustainable fuels like crop-based biofuels. “Many member states acknowledged the importance of both aims, though uncertainty over the framework’s eventual adoption remained a clear backdrop to discussions,” Shaw said.

Next Steps

The IMO will reconvene for technical working group talks from April 20-24, 2026, followed by the 84th session of the Marine Environment Protection Committee from April 27 to May 1.

MEPC 84 is planned to finalize decisions on clean energy under the NZF, including the LCA guidelines, which are essential for evaluating the environmental impact of marine fuels and determining vessels’ compliance with the framework.

Days after the IMO delay, more than 200 industry leaders gathered in Antwerp for the Global Maritime Forum Annual Summit, where participants reported feeling “hopeful and energised” despite the setback. IMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez encouraged leaders to view the delay as a pause on adoption, not on the underlying work. “This extra year gives us the chance to connect with all the stakeholders and parties in order to address the questions that were raised, including the lack of clarity around the framework,” Dominguez said.",https://gcaptain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/2022-07-11T050025Z_666471803_RC2G9V9UXH5H_RTRMADP_3_SHIPPING-EMISSIONS-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 16:16:27.629962
