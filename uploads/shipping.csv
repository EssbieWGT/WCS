Using a consequential LCA, which accounts for emissions avoided through the displacement of carbon-intensive materials in end products by those produced with captured carbon, emissions savings were 7.9% across the value chain.
“Under the current attributional treatment recommended in the IMO guidelines, utilisation pathways can appear to deliver no emissions savings because avoided emissions from product displacement are excluded.
GCMD assessed the ghg savings of its value chain against permanent storage of the captured CO2.
In a hypothetical scenario where onboard carbon capture rates are boosted to 40%, carbon capture and permanent storage leads to emissions savings of 21%, while utilisation of the captured carbon brings 34% emissions savings.","The emissions reductions impact of deploying carbon capture technologies in the maritime industry may be understated using accounting methods recommended by IMO guidelines, limiting incentives for shipowners to invest in such systems, according to a new report.

The regulatory issue was one of the findings of a GCMD report on its pilot project to demonstrate a full value chain for onboard capture carbon dioxide; the project involved the capture and offload of over 25 tonnes of CO2 on Evergreen containership Ever Top.

Using an attributional lifecycle analysis (LCA) of the project’s carbon value chain gave a net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions increase of 8.6% across the value chain when compared to a baseline of not using onboard carbon capture and storage (OCCS). The attributional LCA looks at the carbon value chain from a shipowner’s perspective and its scope ends at utilisation of the carbon, assuming the CO2 will be permanently stored, thus omitting the full impact of utilisation in end products.

The carbon captured onboard Ever Top was used as feedstock to recycle steel slag into post-carbonated slag (PCS) and precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC). PCC is a common component in the production of building materials like concrete — its usual production methods involve a carbon-intensive process using limestone.

Using a consequential LCA, which accounts for emissions avoided through the displacement of carbon-intensive materials in end products by those produced with captured carbon, emissions savings were 7.9% across the value chain.

“Under the current attributional treatment recommended in the IMO guidelines, utilisation pathways can appear to deliver no emissions savings because avoided emissions from product displacement are excluded. This in turn provides no incentive for shipowners and operators to invest in the substantial capital expenditure and operational expenses required to deploy OCCS,” the report said.

Efficiency improvements

Analysis of the pilot scheme identified several inefficiencies that had limited ghg emissions savings across the value chain, inefficiencies that could be addressed in future OCCS deployments.

The lack of a waste heat recovery system onboard Ever Top meant the fuel penalty when running the OCCS system was 5%, compared to 1.5% if a waste heat recovery system had been in place. Transport and logistics emissions for the value chain were high, including 26% from hose purging and 52% from the 2,200 km overland transport of the captured liquid CO2 by truck from port to processing plant.

Eliminating these and other “first-time” infefficiencies, by installing a waste heat recovery system and transporting the LCO2 overland by pipeline, boosts the emissions savings using a consequential LCA from 7.9% to 17.8%, the report said.

GCMD assessed the ghg savings of its value chain against permanent storage of the captured CO2. In a hypothetical scenario where onboard carbon capture rates are boosted to 40%, carbon capture and permanent storage leads to emissions savings of 21%, while utilisation of the captured carbon brings 34% emissions savings.

Professor Lynn Loo, CEO of GCMD, said the project “shows that onboard carbon capture, when thoughtfully integrated with utilisation pathways, can deliver real emissions reductions today while we continue to scale up low- and zero-carbon fuels. It also highlights how we measure and account for those reductions matter. If our frameworks continue to ignore avoided emissions and displaced carbon, we risk disincentivising investments in solutions that can meaningfully bend the emissions curve.”",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltdcfe6aab5515629e/bltb007cf58f2cb5eba/6862a60e3b0bdb354b242cbb/Evergreen-CO2-STS-Credit-GCMD.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2026-01-06 20:57:27.107661

The vessel operated on a roundtrip voyage from Singapore to Brazil, successfully using 65 tonnes of fuel blend with 20% MASH Makes biofuel in its auxiliary engine.

The trial confirmed that MASH Makes’ biofuel works as a drop-in solution — compatible with existing systems and able to reduce fossil fuel use in specific marine applications.

“This trial proves that MASH Makes’ biofuel is suitable for marine engines, and it marks an important milestone towards bringing the fuel into our operation,” said Henrik Røjel, head of decarbonisation and climate solutions, NORDEN.

The results point to a practical path for shipowners to cut emissions without waiting for new infrastructure.

If the new agreement by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) to cap and price excess emissions globally is ratified in October 2025, MASH Makes offers a solution that enables shipowners to start significantly reducing their emissions well before the agreement takes effect in 2028.

A seamless, scalable alternative to fossil fuels MASH Makes biofuel is produced by heating agricultural residues at high temperatures without oxygen.

The resulting bio-oil is comparable with ISO8217 standard fossil fuels. Unlike emerging fuels like green hydrogen or ammonia, which require new infrastructure, MASH Makes biofuel integrates directly with existing systems. It also offers flexibility for blending, including with VLSFOs and MGOs, without costly retrofits.

“Our biofuel meets the technical requirements of the shipping industry and can be used in unmodified engines. Our independent analysis shows that MASH Makes’ biofuel production process is carbon negative, which is driven by the permanent carbon sequestration achieved through the co-produced biochar and its use in sustainable agriculture, added Maria Jamarillo, senior analyst, boundless impact research & analysis.

For every tonne of biofuel produced, MASH Makes also generates 1.8 tonnes of biochar, a stable, carbon-rich material applied to soil.

MASH Makes biofuel is produced through pyrolysis, which converts agricultural residues into renewable energy.

Diversified value chains A particularly interesting scenario lies with multinational companies that operate vessels, and trade commodities, across multiple markets.","TIME FOR AMMONIA?

Research shows that ammonia is likely to become the most competitive fuel through the 2030s. If half the sector is running on ammonia in the 2040s, then fleets still running on methanol or LNG are expected to have a 30 to 50 percent higher cost of operating. That is not commercially sustainable.

So why are people not jumping on the ammonia bandwagon as fast as they can? At UCL’s Energy Institute, our multidisciplinary team works to answer these types of questions. And the answer to who will move first seems to fall into six key areas:

1. Progressive investment

When governments make transition part of their industrial strategy, we see powerful shifts.

In Scandinavia, geographical suitability, domestic gas resources, engineering skills, and strong industrial policy aligned to see Norway and Sweden lead the LNG transition. Now, Scandinavian firms are leading the way again with firms like Höegh Autoliners ordering ammonia-ready vessels.

2. Existing carriers

While policy sets the stage, existing infrastructure and cargo types also shape who moves first, and a clear group of early adopters are those already carrying cleaner fuels as cargos.

It’s easier for a vessel to use its cargo as fuel than to start from scratch. It also simplifies crewing and reduces the energy supply chain, such as bunkering.

3. High-value cargos

Market dynamics also matter. Consumers are often willing to pay a premium for carbonneutral products, meaning vessels transporting high-value goods can absorb the cost of zero-emissions shipping more easily.

One initiative, ZEMBA (Zero Emissions Maritime Buyers Alliance), is already showing how buyer influence can accelerate change, and their first tender for low-emission shipping was won by Hapag Lloyd in 2024.

4. Geographical advantages

Some nations also already have a hydrogen advantage, typically places with high sun or wind that have good existing maritime infrastructure. Countries like Australia and Saudi Arabia are likely to become major hydrogen (or ammonia) producers, making fleet conversion easier to realize.

Services most suited to make this change are those that operate between just two ports, allowing vessel design and refueling to be optimized. For instance, BHP has recently signed contracts for two ammonia dual-fueled bulk carriers for the Australia to China iron ore route.

5. Diversified value chains

A particularly interesting scenario lies with multinational companies that operate vessels, and trade commodities, across multiple markets. These firms can spread the risk of decarbonization across their value chains.

A great example is Japanese import/ export firm Itochu, which has the flexibility to experiment with low-emission solutions and is now investing in ammonia at scale.

6. Disruptors

And finally, let’s not dismiss the power of the individual. History shows us that disruptors can reshape entire industries, just think Steve Jobs and the iPhone. While shipping has long been seen as a risk-averse sector, leaders are starting to emerge with a “let’s do this” mindset, such as Alex Saverys at CMB.

But what is the point of all this theory? I hope it will help companies identify whether they are in a position to move first. The evidence clearly shows that the transition to renewable energy is well underway, and those that get ahead of the game are likely to be the longterm winners.",https://oceannews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMarEST_logo_CMYK.jpg,N,,2026-01-05 16:12:06.429314

Global Head of Clarksons Research, Steve Gordon, said: “With the geopolitical and industry consensus on emissions regulation stalling for the moment and continued challenges around ‘green’ fuel pricing and availability, trends in alternative fuel uptake have stabilised across 2025 with the share of orderbook tonnage adopting alternative fuel steady at 47% (end 2024: 50%, end 2015: 10%).”

Container ships dominated new orders in 2025 and continued to lead in alternative fuel contracting: 62% of boxship capacity will be alternative fuel capable. Ship sectors that can use cargo as fuel, such as LNG and LPG carriers, or have consistent trading patterns and supportive stakeholders such as container and pure car carrier operators, continue to have the highest take-up rates, the Clarksons analysis revealed.

LNG continues to be the leading alternative fuel of choice, accounting for 80% of orders, a 5% increase on the 2024 figure. This comes against a backdrop of continuing concern over the availability and bunkering facilities for other fuels such as green methanol and ammonia, Clarkson said. The analysts recorded 256 contracts for LNG-capable vessels (195 excluding LNG carriers), 66 methanol-capable ships, five ammonia units, 21 capable of using LPG, and nine hydrogen-ready vessels. Ships ordered with battery power numbered 171.

In terms of deliveries, a record number of 484 ships of almost 34 million gross tons (GT) joined the fleet, bringing the alternative fuel-capable fleet to 9% of the global fleet in GT terms. Taking into account this new record and the 47% of ships on order that are set to be alternative-fuelled, Clarkson estimates that more than 20% of the world fleet will be able to operate on alternative fuels by 2030.

Meanwhile, the take-up energy-saving technologies (EST) continues at pace. About 14,200 vessels are now fitted with energy-saving devices of various types, representing about 46% of the fleet. They include rudder bulbs, propeller ducts, Flettner rotors, wind kites, and air lubrication systems.

Climate negotiations at the International Maritime Organization (IMO) over the Net-Zero Framework have reached a serious deadlock—one that could significantly shape the future of international shipping and transportation. Economic pressure from the United States, including threats of punitive tariffs and port restrictions, has led to a shift in position by countries controlling more than half of the world’s maritime transport capacity.

According to reports from reputable maritime industry sources, these pressures have increased the likelihood of suspending the final vote on the Net-Zero Framework, placing all 176 IMO member states on the brink of a critical decision. This decision will determine the fate of the most important environmental agreement in the international transportation sector.

The Net-Zero Framework: A Threat or an Opportunity for Maritime Transport?

The Net-Zero Framework is the result of more than five years of intensive negotiations and aims to gradually reduce carbon emissions in the shipping industry, reaching net-zero emissions by 2050. The maritime sector produces approximately one billion tons of carbon dioxide annually, accounting for a significant share of global emissions.

The framework sets the following interim targets:

A 20% reduction in emissions by 2030

A 70% reduction in emissions by 2040

However, opposition from oil-producing countries, combined with increasing U.S. economic pressure, has disrupted the balance of negotiations and cast doubt on the implementation of this plan—directly affecting international shipping services and logistics costs.

A Divide in Europe: Concerns of Maritime Powers

Greece, Cyprus, and Malta—three major maritime nations in Europe—have announced their intention to vote against the official position of the European Union. Together, these countries control nearly 40% of Europe’s commercial fleet and are concerned about losing competitiveness if strict carbon pricing policies are implemented.

This unprecedented rift highlights the direct impact of climate-related decisions on global supply chains and the shipment of goods to ports around the world.

Suspension of Negotiations: A Likely IMO Scenario

The IMO Secretariat has proposed a “procedural suspension” as a temporary solution—allowing the postponement of the vote without setting a specific deadline. If the framework is fully rejected, it cannot be reintroduced for at least two years.

Even if approved, countries representing more than 50% of global tonnage could formally object and halt its implementation, raising serious concerns about policy stability in international shipping and transportation.

Postponement of the MEPC Meeting and the Future of Maritime Policy

The extraordinary session of the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC), originally scheduled for October 2025, has been postponed for one year and will resume in 2026. During this period, intersessional working groups will continue drafting implementation guidelines.

The Net-Zero Framework consists of two main pillars:

The Global Marine Fuel Standard

The Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions Pricing Mechanism

Nevertheless, the practical enforcement of these policies depends on achieving political consensus at the international level.

Conclusion: Implications for Multimodal Transport and Global Trade

The current deadlock in IMO negotiations could have a direct impact on multimodal sea and land transport, logistics costs, and the process of shipping goods to ports worldwide.

During a recent meeting in London, they indicated agreement on an interim emissions reduction target for 2030, though specifics on the magnitude of emissions cuts were not disclosed. The IMO is currently debating a more ambitious climate agenda that seeks to not only halve shipping emissions by 2050 but also establish a net-zero target.

Net-zero emissions involve reducing greenhouse gas emissions as close to zero as possible, balancing any remaining emissions through natural processes, such as reabsorption by oceans and forests. Absolute zero-emissions mean complete decarbonization without relying on offsets or carbon capture. The shipping industry is exploring alternative fuels like hydrogen and ammonia, which offer low-carbon solutions but also pose safety challenges due to their flammability and toxicity.

Max Mejia, president of the World Maritime University, emphasized the need for enhanced training for seafarers to proficiently manage these new technologies and fuels. The Philippines is poised to upskill its maritime workforce to facilitate this necessary transition. However, achieving consensus across global shipping companies and training centers is essential for successful adoption of these guidelines.

At a recent climate summit, 32 countries backed an absolute zero-emissions goal by 2050, with several Asian nations and major shipping stakeholders like Singapore supporting the net-zero target. In contrast, countries such as China, India, and Indonesia resisted calls for more ambitious goals. The global shipping sector is responsible for approximately 90% of international trade and emits about one billion tonnes of greenhouse gases annually, equating to the emissions produced by 121 coal power plants.

Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos, Jr. has actively called for enhancing educational programs to equip Filipino seafarers for the upcoming shift from traditional fuels to green ammonia between 2030-2040. In his speech at a Manila conference, he stressed the necessity of adapting the shipping industry to incorporate new technologies, including retooling existing ships and building modern vessels.

The European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) had previously considered banning Filipino seafarers from European ships due to training inadequacies but later recognized the progress made by Philippine authorities in upgrading training programs. EMSA is now investing over $4 million to further enhance the training framework for Filipino seafarers, highlighting a commitment to improving maritime training standards.",https://maritimefairtrade.org/wp-content/uploads/pwa/icon-192.png,N,,2026-01-04 01:56:25.673965

Currently, a significant meeting is underway in London, focused on advancing the global maritime sector toward achieving a mid-century net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions target. This week, the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) Intersessional Working Group on GHG Reduction (ISWG-19) is exploring options to price emissions from fossil fuel usage in maritime operations.

The discussions aim to clarify positions on three primary carbon pricing options: a crediting mechanism, a ‘strong’ levy, and a ‘weak’ levy. This debate sets the stage for a broader meeting of the Marine Policy Environment Committee (MEPC) next week, which will delve into carbon pricing alongside two other significant tracks: establishing a Carbon Intensity Indicator for ship efficiency standards and implementing a green fuel standard to lower the GHG intensity of marine fuels.

Carbon Pricing Mechanisms

All three proposed carbon pricing options rest on a Global Fuel Standard that dictates the maximum GHG intensity permissible over time, measured in CO2 equivalent per gigajoule of energy for maritime fuels. The ongoing discussions are part of a lengthy process initiated by the UN’s maritime arm to address the sector’s GHG emissions, owing to its exclusion from the Kyoto Protocol and subsequent climate agreements, which instead delegated regulatory authority to the IMO and the International Civil Aviation Organization.

Aviation has already adopted a carbon pricing scheme known as the Corsia decarbonization system. In contrast, shipping has yet to finalize a pricing approach. Recent observations indicate a shift in the EU’s position that aligns with a compromise “bridging proposal” favoring a credit mechanism. This change comes with backing from several countries, including Singapore, China, and Brazil. If the EU supports the credit mechanism, analysts suggest that the levy option may be sidelined in favor of this approach.

Perspectives on Carbon Pricing Options

Environmental NGO Seas At Risk notes that while the levy offers an equitable solution, the credit trading mechanism could facilitate an energy transition, particularly for zero or near-zero GHG emission fuels expected to be produced mainly in developing nations. However, concerns about revenue instability and market unpredictability linger. Most smaller and poorer developing countries advocate for the non-carbon credit levy, arguing it could generate approximately $1,500 billion by 2050, compared to only $150 billion projected under a credit mechanism.

Urgency for Agreement

Reaching a consensus in the coming weeks is critical, as the IMO aims to meet an October 2025 deadline for agreeing on mid-term measures as part of its revised GHG Strategy established in 2023. The maritime industry currently accounts for about 2% of global GHG emissions, and the IMO’s target to achieve net-zero “around” 2050 includes non-binding interim targets for 2030 and 2040.

While some refined proposals for mid-term measures have garnered support, experts caution that definitive breakthroughs may not occur this year. Delays extending into 2026 or beyond could push decisions close to three decades after the Kyoto talks transitioned responsibility for maritime GHG emissions to the IMO. Additionally, the implementation of adopted measures may take effect 16 months after MEPC approval, under a “tacit acceptance” procedure, emphasizing the pressing need for timely actions within the maritime sector.",https://maritimefairtrade.org/wp-content/uploads/pwa/icon-192.png,N,,2026-01-03 20:56:37.596814

This is the second consecutive time India has topped the vote tally, placing it alongside major maritime nations, such as Germany, France, Canada, the United Arab Emirates, Australia, Spain, Sweden, the Netherlands, and Brazil. The support India received reflects its emerging role as a committed, forward-looking voice in global maritime governance.

Why This Seat Matters for India

The IMO, a United Nations (UN) agency, works to make shipping safer and cleaner, and reduce pollution from ships, in line with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The IMO Assembly, comprising all member states, is its top decision-making body. The Assembly meets every two years to approve the work programme and budget, and to elect the Council. The Council acts as the executive body, steering the Organization’s work between Assembly meetings. Council members are elected under three categories: Category A includes countries most involved in providing international shipping services; Category B covers those with the largest stake in global seaborne trade; and Category C represents countries with specific maritime interests, ensuring broad geographic balance.

Holding a Category B seat allows India to play an integral role in shaping discussions on key issues, including shipping safety, decarbonisation, digitalisation, and seafarer welfare.

Around 95 percent of India’s trade by volume and about 70 percent by value is carried by sea. Moreover, India has been steadily expanding its maritime ambitions through initiatives such as the Sagarmala programme, Maritime Vision 2030, and Maritime Amrit Kaal Vision 2047, while aligning closely with global standards. A seat on the IMO Council complements these efforts and gives India a platform to support practical, balanced, and inclusive rules at a time when the global maritime sector is changing rapidly. It also provides India with a platform to learn from international best practices, share its experience, and bolster its own policies. The backing India received in the elections reflects confidence in its sound and consistent approach.

India’s presence on the Council underscores its growing role as a responsible global maritime player, particularly in supporting capacity-building and knowledge-sharing across the Global South. Holding a Category B seat allows India to play an integral role in shaping discussions on key issues, including shipping safety, decarbonisation, digitalisation, and seafarer welfare. As India expands its ports, develops shipbuilding capacity, and strengthens green logistics networks, its involvement in global decision-making ensures that its national priorities align with the international rules-based order and that the voice of the Global South is heard.

Supporting a Fair and Sustainable Transition

Climate action remains central to the IMO’s agenda as global shipping works towards net-zero emissions by 2050. India’s re-election to the IMO Council allows it to continue shaping this transition, while emphasising that decarbonisation must be effective, affordable, and fair, especially for developing maritime nations facing high compliance costs. India’s own experience gives weight to this position, enabling it to argue for practical pathways that balance climate goals with development needs, supported by innovation and targeted investments.

India’s green shipping efforts are already evident across its ports and maritime sector. Initiatives such as the Harit Sagar Guidelines and the Harit Shrey incentive scheme are encouraging cleaner vessels and lower emissions, supported by renewable energy usage, clean-fuel pilots, electric harbour craft, and progress in ship recycling. Work on green and digital shipping corridors, along with the Green Port Performance Index, is helping align port operations with climate resilience, efficiency, and environmental protection.

With a long coastline and an expanding port network, resilient and future-ready port cities are a strategic priority for India. Its Council role also reinforces its efforts to address regional environmental risks in the Indian Ocean, including pollution, ballast water discharge, and rising shipping traffic. It also enables India to combine its domestic reforms with international engagement to support cleaner maritime growth.

India’s hands-on experience, including anti-piracy patrols in the Gulf of Aden and sustained engagement in the Western Indian Ocean, lends credibility and strengthens regional maritime awareness through the Information Fusion Centre-Indian Ocean Region (IFC-IOR) and partnerships with the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (QUAD) members, the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) countries, and African coastal states.

Reinforcing Connectivity and Maritime Security Cooperation

More than 90 percent of global trade moves by sea, making the IMO key to maintaining global economic stability. As India’s role in maritime logistics and shipbuilding grows, staying closely involved in regulatory processes becomes increasingly important. Being on the IMO Council enables India to contribute to discussions on frameworks such as the International Ship and Port Facility Security (ISPS) Code and casualty investigation guidelines, helping guide how countries respond to threats at sea, from piracy to humanitarian crises. India’s hands-on experience, including anti-piracy patrols in the Gulf of Aden and sustained engagement in the Western Indian Ocean, lends credibility and strengthens regional maritime awareness through the Information Fusion Centre-Indian Ocean Region (IFC-IOR) and partnerships with the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (QUAD) members, the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) countries, and African coastal states.

India’s Council role also allows it to push for strategic and sustainable maritime connectivity. Initiatives like SAGAR (Security and Growth for All in the Region), green and digital shipping corridors with Singapore and Rotterdam, and cooperation with Japan’s Quality Infrastructure Partnership, along with emerging trade routes such as the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC) and maritime links with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC), enhance trade and connectivity, help reduce emissions, and make supply chains more resilient.

Through its global partnerships, engagement with regional actors, shipbuilding initiatives, and its role at the IMO, India can bridge the divide between developed and developing countries, build consensus, strengthen maritime security, and support a fair and steady global trading system.

At the same time, India remains aware of the impact of China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and of rising maritime risks in the Indo-Pacific, the South China Sea, and the Red Sea. Through its global partnerships, engagement with regional actors, shipbuilding initiatives, and its role at the IMO, India can bridge the divide between developed and developing countries, build consensus, strengthen maritime security, and support a fair and steady global trading system.

Placing People at the Centre of Maritime Development

Nearly 40 percent of the world’s population lives within 100 km of a coastline, making people central to sustainable maritime development. As major ports expand in close proximity to urban areas, local communities increasingly bear the environmental and social costs. Vulnerable groups such as fishers, informal workers, women, and migrant labourers are frequently the most affected. Emerging port cities in the Global South handle millions of cargo units each year, yet they continue to face governance challenges. Port-led growth can transform urban landscapes, affecting access to waterfronts, traditional livelihoods, and public spaces. For port expansion, digitalisation, and green transitions to truly benefit both cities and communities, it will be important to balance economic goals, policy needs, and environmental safeguards with the aspirations of local communities, while encouraging multistakeholder collaboration to ensure that growth benefits all.

India could strengthen its focus on community wellbeing at the IMO and champion these priorities while integrating local needs with broader development goals. Building on its existing initiatives, India can promote greater integration of local knowledge, indigenous perspectives, heritage-sensitive planning, and coordinated governance to create sustainable coastal regions. As one of the world’s largest suppliers of seafarers, India has a strong stake in safeguarding their welfare. Through initiatives such as Sagar Mein Samman, India supports training, mental health, gender equality, safety, and humane working conditions for seafarers. Its partnership with the International Seafarers’ Welfare and Assistance Network strengthens collaboration on infrastructure, facilities, and wellbeing for seafarers and onshore employees, as well as support for their families, aligning with global standards. Together, these initiatives give India a strong platform at the IMO to promote people-centred maritime development and inclusive policies for the Global South.

India can promote greater integration of local knowledge, indigenous perspectives, heritage-sensitive planning, and coordinated governance to create sustainable coastal regions.

Conclusion

India’s re-election to the IMO Council reflects its growing strength and its increasingly significant role in the maritime sector, especially as developing countries seek a stronger voice in global rule-making. This election hands India a timely opportunity to influence the future of maritime and ocean governance. As global trade patterns shift, India’s presence on the Council adds stability and direction. India’s growing port network and national initiatives enable it to demonstrate how maritime development can enhance efficiency, support local communities, and protect the environment, offering examples other developing countries can follow.

Over the next two years, India can further help deepen cooperation, build regional partnerships, encourage knowledge transfer, and promote a safe, sustainable, and inclusive maritime order. Most importantly, this presents India with another chance to shape the global maritime discourse, guided by a pragmatic and equitable long-term vision.

Heike Deggim, Director of IMO’s Maritime Safety Division, elaborated on the organization’s focus in the Arctic and its engagement with the Council.

The pressing issues that attract IMO’s attention include ensuring the safety, security, and sustainability of shipping in the Arctic. IMO aims to mitigate risks related to search and rescue operations, pollution response, maritime safety, and environmental protection in this fragile region. The organization’s Polar Code establishes mandatory requirements for vessels operating in polar environments, enhancing safety standards beyond existing regulations. However, there is recognition that additional measures are needed, particularly for boats not covered by the Polar Code, such as fishing vessels and pleasure yachts. IMO has invited its Member States to voluntarily implement Polar Code safety measures across these vessels.

Broader maritime concerns also occupy IMO’s focus, including the enhancement of navigational charts, establishment of search and rescue facilities, improvements in satellite and radio communications, and the creation of port reception facilities for operational waste. A significant aspect of IMO’s mission is contributing to global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from shipping, aiming for at least a 50% reduction in emissions by 2050. This initiative is aligned with the Paris Agreement and supported by various practical projects aimed at fostering technology development and operational best practices, particularly in developing countries.

In the Arctic, Member States are intensifying efforts to address black carbon emissions from ships and are advocating for extending the current ban on heavy fuel oil from the Antarctic to Arctic waters. Furthermore, addressing marine litter and microplastics is a key initiative; IMO is collaborating with the United Nations Environment Program to combat sea-based sources of marine litter.

Following its accreditation, IMO has engaged with the Arctic Council through formal channels, building upon past informal collaborations on projects such as the “Guide on Oil Spill Response in Ice and Snow Conditions.” Current collaborations involve the Arctic Shipping Best Practice Information Forum, enhancing the effectiveness of the Polar Code. Upcoming meetings will continue to strengthen the communication between IMO Member States and the Arctic Council.

Furthermore, IMO is actively developing specifications for ships’ equipment in polar waters, focusing on guidelines for navigation and life-saving appliances for vessels not covered by the Polar Code. Recent sessions have led to the creation of guidelines targeting pleasure yachts and fishing vessels operating in these regions.",https://maritimefairtrade.org/wp-content/uploads/pwa/icon-192.png,N,,2026-01-03 10:12:43.527029

For port expansion, digitalisation, and green transitions to truly benefit both cities and communities, it will be important to balance economic goals, policy needs, and environmental safeguards with the aspirations of local communities, while encouraging multistakeholder collaboration to ensure that growth benefits all.

India could strengthen its focus on community wellbeing at the IMO and champion these priorities while integrating local needs with broader development goals. Building on its existing initiatives, India can promote greater integration of local knowledge, indigenous perspectives, heritage-sensitive planning, and coordinated governance to create sustainable coastal regions. As one of the world’s largest suppliers of seafarers, India has a strong stake in safeguarding their welfare. Through initiatives such as Sagar Mein Samman, India supports training, mental health, gender equality, safety, and humane working conditions for seafarers. Its partnership with the International Seafarers’ Welfare and Assistance Network strengthens collaboration on infrastructure, facilities, and wellbeing for seafarers and onshore employees, as well as support for their families, aligning with global standards. Together, these initiatives give India a strong platform at the IMO to promote people-centred maritime development and inclusive policies for the Global South.

India can promote greater integration of local knowledge, indigenous perspectives, heritage-sensitive planning, and coordinated governance to create sustainable coastal regions.

Conclusion

India’s re-election to the IMO Council reflects its growing strength and its increasingly significant role in the maritime sector, especially as developing countries seek a stronger voice in global rule-making. This election hands India a timely opportunity to influence the future of maritime and ocean governance. As global trade patterns shift, India’s presence on the Council adds stability and direction. India’s growing port network and national initiatives enable it to demonstrate how maritime development can enhance efficiency, support local communities, and protect the environment, offering examples other developing countries can follow.

Over the next two years, India can further help deepen cooperation, build regional partnerships, encourage knowledge transfer, and promote a safe, sustainable, and inclusive maritime order. Most importantly, this presents India with another chance to shape the global maritime discourse, guided by a pragmatic and equitable long-term vision.

While DHL aims to reach net-zero GHG emissions by 2050, Olivier Nivoix, Executive Vice President Shipping, CMA CGM Group, confirmed: ""Our partnership with DHL demonstrates how collaboration can accelerate the shift to low-carbon shipping. ACT+ offers reliable and scalable solutions backed by our fleet designed for alternative fuels. CMA CGM, committed to Net Zero Carbon by 2050, has already cut the carbon intensity of its shipping activities by 57% since 2008 and is investing heavily in alternative fuels and dual-fuel vessels.""

Both companies will continue to explore opportunities to scale up lower-carbon fuel usage and develop collaborative approaches to decarbonize international supply chains.

What is GoGreen Plus?

DHL's GoGreen Plus products provide decarbonized solutions across DHL's core offerings by leveraging sustainable fuels and low carbon technology. GoGreen Plus products are based on true value chain decarbonization. This is enabled by the 'book & claim' approach. Book & claim enables DHL to directly replace fossil fuels with sustainable fuels within the logistic company's network and allocate environmental benefits to paying customers, even when their shipments are not physically transported with the assets using these fuels. GoGreen Plus allows DHL's customers to reduce their indirect Scope 3 emissions in their value chain arising from upstream and downstream transportation and distribution. It also helps customers with voluntary reporting of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and progress against their decarbonization targets.

903/2022 must permanently discipline the marine diesel on renewable biofuel and possibly other low-carbon fuels, including synthetic fuels.
The authorization granted by ANP à Petrobras for the sale of marine diesel on biofuel renewable It goes beyond a one-off administrative decision.","The ANP (National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels) granted special authorization for Petrobras to market marine diesel with renewable biofuel, ensuring legal certainty, alignment with international standards, and support for the energy transition in the naval sector.

In December 2025, the board of directors of National Agency for Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels (ANP) authorized the Petrobras to market marine diesel with content of biofuel renewable, regularizing operations already underway and strengthening the decarbonization agenda for maritime transport in Brazil.

The decision has retroactive effects.This provides legal certainty to contracts signed since November and allows for the continuation of commercialization until the agency concludes the final review of the regulation governing fuels for maritime use. The ANP's approval represents a significant step towards introducing lower-carbon solutions in the maritime sector, while maintaining rigorous technical and regulatory standards.

ANP authorizes Petrobras and guarantees legal security for marine diesel.

The authorization granted by ANP allows the Petrobras continue selling what's called Verana Diesel, a marine diesel obtained through co-processing of 5% vegetable oil, characterizing the addition of renewable biofuel to the traditional formulation.

The central point of the decision lies in legal certainty. Since sales began before express authorization from the regulatory agency, Petrobras requested a special authorization with retroactive effect. After technical and regulatory analysis, the ANP (National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels) determined that the measure was necessary to regularize the existing situation and provide predictability to the market.

Furthermore, the authorization establishes clear criteria for the continued commercialization of the product until the final regulatory review is completed, avoiding regulatory uncertainty and contractual interruptions.

How Petrobras developed marine diesel with renewable biofuel.

The development of the new marine diesel It happened in a planned and transparent way. In August, the Petrobras presented to ANP The fuel production and marketing plan. In October, the first production took place at the Presidente Bernardes Refinery (RPBC), located in Cubatão, in the state of São Paulo.

Sales began in November, before formal authorization, which led to a subsequent request for regularization. This movement reflects the technical maturity of the product. and the growing demand for fuels aligned with energy transition strategies.

Diesel Verana stands out for incorporating renewable biofuel without requiring significant changes to the logistics infrastructure or the vessels' engines, a factor considered strategic for its gradual adoption in the naval sector.

Regulatory gap regarding marine diesel prompted special authorization from ANP.

The need for special authorization arose from a regulatory gap. The Resolution ANP No. 903/2022, which establishes the specifications for fuels used in waterborne transport, does not foresee the addition of biofuels to marine diesel..

Given this scenario, the revision of the standard was included in ANP Regulatory Agenda 2025-2026, under the supervision of director Pietro Mendes, with completion scheduled for 2026. Until then, the special authorization serves as a transitional instrument to allow regulated innovation.

This approach avoids paralyzing initiatives aligned with decarbonization.while preserving the agency's role as guarantor of fuel quality and safety.

ANP's technical assessment confirms the quality of co-processed marine diesel.

The technical area of ANP evaluated in detail the formulation presented by Petrobras and concluded that the product meets the quality standards required for conventional marine diesel..

The technical report also identified regulatory precedents, such as special authorizations previously granted for bunker B24, which reinforced the consistency of the decision adopted.

This point is essential for the market.because it demonstrates that the introduction of renewable biofuel It does not compromise fundamental technical requirements, such as performance, stability, and operational safety of the vessels.

Alignment of marine diesel with international IMO guidelines.

Another key factor in the decision was the alignment of the initiative with the guidelines of International Maritime Organization (IMO), which guide the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in global maritime transport.

A ANP acknowledged that the co-processed diesel from Petrobras This aligns with those guidelines by reducing the carbon intensity of the fuel without requiring immediate structural changes to the naval fleet.

This international alignment strengthens Brazil's position.This signals that the country is keeping pace with the main global decarbonization trends in one of the most challenging sectors of the energy transition.

Petrobras' strategic role in the naval energy transition.

A Petrobras has been expanding its activities in the development of fuels with a lower environmental impact, and the marine diesel on renewable biofuel It fits directly into this strategy.

Co-processing in existing refineries allows for incremental environmental gains, leveraging already installed assets and reducing technological risks. Furthermore, it creates a regulatory learning environment that contributes to the evolution of the Brazilian regulatory framework.

The initiative also sends a clear signal to the market.This shows that there is room for innovation in the fuel sector, provided it is accompanied by rigorous technical criteria and constant dialogue with the ANP (National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels).

Impacts of ANP authorization on the marine diesel market

In practice, the decision of ANP generates direct effects for the Brazilian market of marine dieselAmong the main impacts are the regularization of contracts signed by Petrobras, the continued supply of co-processed fuel and the reduction of regulatory uncertainties.

For shipowners and operatorsThe measure expands the options for lower-carbon fuels without requiring immediate changes to vessel operations. For the regulated sector, it reinforces predictability and institutional confidence.

Regulatory review by ANP and the future of marine diesel with renewable biofuel.

Despite the progress represented by the special authorization, the final regulations are still under development. The revision of the Resolution... ANP No. 903/2022 must permanently discipline the marine diesel on renewable biofuel and possibly other low-carbon fuels, including synthetic fuels.

According to the director's order Symone AraújoAccording to the case's rapporteur, the authorization aims to regularize the existing situation, provide legal certainty, and establish clear parameters until the regulatory review is completed, scheduled for 2026.

This initiative, primarily advocated by European nations and Brazil, aims to generate up to $15 billion annually to combat climate change, as the IMO estimates that maritime activity contributes to 3% of climate change. However, the proposal has faced strong opposition from U.S. President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans.

Trump has threatened retaliatory measures against countries supporting the tax and plans to withhold U.S. funding to the U.N. if the tax is enacted. He labeled the proposal as a “global green new scam tax,” arguing that it would significantly increase costs for American consumers without receiving approval from their elected representatives—echoing the historical grievance of “taxation without representation.” The editorial suggests that the proposed tax could hinder global commerce and burden American consumers with higher prices.

That rises by about 45% to roughly $315 per tonne from Jan. 1, 2026, reflecting the shift to full compliance.

Using an assumed EUA price of €85.02, compliance costs per tonne of fuel burned increase to about $315 for high sulphur fuel oil (HSFO), $319 for VLSFO and $324 for low-sulphur marine gasoil ((LS)MGO), compared with roughly $217–$224 previously.

Average VLSFO prices in the EMEA region stood at about $464.50 per tonne at the end of 2025. Under the regulation, ships above 5,000 gross tonnes calling at EU ports are required to pay for emissions on a per-voyage basis. Actual compliance costs can vary depending on voyage patterns, including cases where only one EU port is involved.

Emissions generated during a calendar year are covered by the purchase and surrender of EU allowances (EUAs), with surrender due by September of the following year. As a result, emissions produced in 2025 are settled in September 2026 at the 70% compliance rate, while emissions generated in 2026 will be settled in September 2027 at the full 100% rate.

For more than 70 years, the IMO has overseen the development of international conventions, codes, guidelines and recommendations that govern global shipping.
It reinforces the idea that international maritime governance only delivers value when policies are applied consistently, monitored rigorously and supported by capable institutions.","The International Maritime Organization has announced “From Policy to Practice: Powering Maritime Excellence” as its World Maritime Day theme for 2026 and 2027, marking the first time the organisation has adopted a two-year thematic focus.

The extended timeframe signals a clear shift from norm-setting to delivery. It reflects the IMO’s determination to ensure that the global rules it develops are not only agreed at international level, but are implemented, enforced and embedded into the daily operations of the maritime sector. The theme will culminate in World Maritime Day celebrations on the final Thursday of September each year.

At its core, the theme places emphasis on implementation. “From Policy to Practice” speaks directly to the long-standing challenge of translating international maritime conventions into effective national legislation, operational compliance and enforcement. While IMO instruments form one of the most comprehensive regulatory frameworks in global governance, their impact depends on how consistently they are applied by Member States.

The phrase “Powering” reflects the practical mechanisms behind this transition. Through technical assistance, capacity-building, training and technical cooperation, the IMO and its partners support countries in strengthening maritime administrations, port State control systems and regulatory oversight. This targeted support is designed to convert legal commitments into measurable results.

“Maritime Excellence” defines the end goal. It points to a shipping industry that is safe, secure, efficient and environmentally responsible, operating in line with the highest international standards. Excellence, in this context, is not static. It requires continuous improvement, innovation and accountability across the entire maritime value chain.

For more than 70 years, the IMO has overseen the development of international conventions, codes, guidelines and recommendations that govern global shipping. However, assessments under the IMO Member State Audit Scheme have consistently highlighted gaps in national legislation, implementation and enforcement. These findings underline the importance of moving beyond ratification towards sustained regulatory effectiveness.

By placing global attention on implementation over a two-year period, the 2026–2027 theme aims to accelerate national action and strengthen compliance with IMO instruments. It reinforces the idea that international maritime governance only delivers value when policies are applied consistently, monitored rigorously and supported by capable institutions.

The theme also aligns closely with the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, supporting goals on resilient infrastructure, climate action, protection of marine ecosystems and international partnerships. It underscores the central role of maritime governance in achieving sustainable development outcomes in an interconnected global economy.

For Africa, where many coastal and island states continue to balance expanding maritime opportunities with capacity constraints, the theme is particularly timely.

LNG — The Tailored Transitional Look

If marine fuels had a little black dress, LNG would be it. Globally recognizable, easy to style, and adaptable to many settings, LNG remains the go to for shipowners wanting to stay on trend. But 2026 is shaping up as a renewed season for this transitional classic, supported by real infrastructure and fleet deployment data.

A major design pivot is underway: global LNG supply continues to expand through projects in Qatar, the U.S. and Australia, keeping the fuel widely available at bunkering hubs worldwide. The existing fleet of dual‑fuel LNG ships is large and growing, and classification society analyses confirm that LNG will still dominate transitional fuel orders in 2026 because it reduces key emissions compared with traditional bunker fuels.

The runway isn’t without critique as LNG’s methane emissions profile complicates its long‑term carbon story, but ports from Rotterdam to Singapore to China’s Yangtze Delta have serious LNG deliveries baked into their 2026 bunkering plans, keeping the look practical and present. Design houses are pairing LNG with bio‑LNG where they can, giving it a sustainable accessory vibe without overstatement.

Methanol — Clean Minimalist with Momentum

Methanol sails into 2026 as the minimalist staple of sustainable marine propulsion. It’s technically mature, relatively low-risk, and getting styled into fleets that need a drop-in fuel with scalable availability. For operators, the appeal is straightforward: no radical redesigns, just clean-burning flexibility. DNV places methanol near the top of its alternative fuel readiness index, and ABS, BV, and Lloyd’s Register all offer class notations and safety guidelines for methanol-fueled ships.

Infrastructure continues to thread globally. Singapore and Rotterdam anchor the look, while Hamburg and Busan build out refueling couture. The China Classification Society (CCS) named methanol one of four core sustainable fuels in its 2025 Sustainable Fuel Development Report. Meanwhile, producers like Proman and Methanex are expanding global supply with terminals in Canada, Trinidad, the U.S. Gulf, and Oman and new demand points emerging in Duqm, Santos, and along Australia’s southeast coast.

Methanol isn’t a runway novelty anymore. It’s being cut into deep-sea container service, shortsea feeders, bulkers, and product tankers. Regulatory clarity, rising port access, and a maturing fuel value chain make it one of the most ready-to-wear looks in the 2026 decarbonization lineup.

Wind Propulsion: Vintage Comeback, Modern Twist

Call it the Greta effect, or just the return of a classic but in 2026, wind is billowing back into the marine propulsion wardrobe. Once dismissed as too retro, sails and their high-tech cousins are now walking tall on the carbon-neutral runway. From rotor sails to suction wings to sky-kites, the silhouette is streamlined and the impact is aerodynamic. You can thank high fuel prices, tight CII grades, and IMO deadlines for turning this breeze into a business model.

Wind propulsion is also backed by global policy discussion. The International Windship Association (IWSA) is working with IMO groups to ensure wind’s contribution can be recognized in emissions frameworks showing that wind’s not just a pet project but part of mainstream decarbonization policy.

In 2026, wind tech will be part of real operational wardrobes, layered with other propulsion looks. It helps cut fuel costs and emissions, brings practical benefits where geography and weather cooperate, and carries institutional support that makes it more than just a runway filler.

🤔 What’s Warm: Ready-To-Wear and Boutique

Biofuels — The World Tour Remix (2026 Edition)

Forget fringe couture. In 2026, biofuel blends will be a global staple that operators don’t just talk about but actually don at major hubs. Singapore’s bunker market has already shown that marine bio‑bunker volumes are real and scaling. In 2024, Singapore sold about 880,000 metric tons of biofuel blends, significantly more than the previous year and a clear signal that blends are market‑ready rather than future fantasy. This milestone suggests that in 2026, biofuel blends will stay in heavy rotation at key ports where regulations and supply coincide.

While overall global volumes remain a fraction of total bunkers, biofuel blends have been delivered on all continents, according to white‑paper assessments of actual bunkering activity. That means ships calling at multiple continents are likely to see blended fuels available along their trade routes next year in hubs attuned to decarbonization policies.

At the same time, some markets such as Asia Pacific may see slower than meteoric adoption in 2026 because demand indicators have softened recently, but the trend is steady, not fading. Observers in Singapore report a slowdown in year‑on‑year blend uptake in late 2025, pointing to steady but not explosive volume demand in 2026 compared with 2024/2025 peaks.

Ammonia Steps Onto the 2026 Runway

Ammonia enters 2026 like a bold couture piece that’s almost ready to wear. According to the IMO’s Readiness of Low and Zero‑Carbon Marine Fuels and Technology white paper, ammonia is one of the few zero‑carbon fuels with technical potential to power large ships at deep‑sea scale. The IMO study paints a picture of ammonia transitioning from theoretically interesting to selective real‑world deployment as regulated design frameworks, bunkering discussions, and safety protocols come into sharper focus ahead of wider adoption.

What makes ammonia’s silhouette striking for 2026 is that international maritime rules are evolving to permit its use as a fuel. Interim guidelines and amendments agreed by the IMO’s Maritime Safety Committee will allow ammonia cargo ships to use part of their cargo as fuel, with changes to codes entering force in 2026, enabling owners to purpose‑build or retrofit vessels with ammonia propulsion systems under a recognized global framework.

Fleet‑fashion watchers should expect the first ammonia‑ready and ammonia‑fueled shipments to enter service in 2026 and 2027. While the total number remains small relative to mainstream fuels, ammonia carriers and large bulkers designed for ammonia combustion are on order and under development, with engines and bunkering strategies maturing as part of the global alternative fuel runway.

Hydrogen’s Haute Promise Still Needs Tailoring

Hydrogen is the future couture concept that many designers admire but few are ready to wear off the rack in 2026. Classification societies and technical roadmaps identify hydrogen as a low‑carbon fuel option that could help shipping hit ambitious greenhouse gas targets, particularly if paired with fuel cells or hybrid electric systems. But the infrastructure to produce, store and distribute hydrogen worldwide is not yet ready for mainstream ocean service.

Fuel cells and hydrogen engines are technically valid and under research, but hydrogen’s wide‑scale adoption requires a global bunkering network and ports with safe supply practices, which are unlikely to be in place in 2026. Work with IMO and class societies continues, but for now hydrogen remains a showpiece component for demonstration projects or very specific short‑sea applications rather than full global deployment.

Electric’s Having a Moment (Inland)

Electric propulsion, in both battery and hybrid styles, is becoming a star in the capsule collection for 2026. While long‑haul deep sea electrification isn’t yet practical, electric systems are in active use across short‑sea and inland markets, ferries and hybrid coastal craft, with over 1,000 battery‑equipped vessels already registered globally and more on order.

Classification societies and international standards recognize electric propulsion as ready for broad application in its niche segments, and IMO policy discussions increasingly consider shore power and hybrid systems as part of decarbonization pathways. Battery hybrids are not just chic accessories but functionally transformative in regions where charging infrastructure is available. By 2026 we’ll see electric fashion walk the route on ferries, coastal RoPax, and ferries tied to port grids in Europe and Asia.

The big reveal came in 2025 when Incat Tasmania rolled out the world’s largest fully-electric vessel, a 130-meter catamaran designed for high-speed regional service, showcasing what a forty-megawatt-hour battery and a clean hull can actually do when dressed for success.

However, expert Eirik Ovrum from DNV, a Norwegian industrial risk management provider, highlights challenges in advancing fuel supply chains and technology development. Although the testing of innovative technologies is yielding positive outcomes, the speed of progress remains inadequate to achieve broader sustainability goals.

A key area of focus is the adoption of biofuels, such as biodiesel and bio-liquefied natural gas (LNG), which offer substantial reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions compared to traditional fossil fuels. While the demand for these low-GHG fuels is ramping up globally, the supply remains constrained. Ovrum underscores the importance of ramping up production to meet the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) emissions reduction targets for 2030, 2040, and the aspirational goal of net-zero by 2050. He notes that certain types of biodiesel and bio-LNG can achieve anywhere from a 50% reduction to near-zero emissions, allowing shipowners to avoid carbon dioxide (CO2) pricing imposed by the IMO. However, uncertainties regarding production costs and the potential market for biowaste in other sectors complicate forecasts for the future of these fuels.

Onboard carbon capture systems (CCS) are another promising technology that is still in testing phases. Ovrum points out that one of the main challenges with CCS is minimizing the additional energy required to capture CO2 and ensuring the purity of the captured gas, as impurities present significant challenges in the CCS value chain.

Wind-assisted propulsion systems (WAPS) also hold potential for enhancing energy efficiency without relying on low-GHG fuels or CCS. While DNV is in the process of verifying energy savings for vessels equipped with WAPS, the effectiveness of the technology can vary widely from ship to ship, necessitating further development for practical implementation.

Despite these challenges, Ovrum expresses optimism, noting ongoing innovations in testing and regulatory proposals to improve access to biodiesel and bio-LNG. Enhanced models like book-and-claim chains could streamline the acquisition of these fuels. Additionally, several pilot projects for CCS are being tested on operational ships, demonstrating promising advancements. For example, Solvang’s Clipper Eris has been testing an onboard CCS for over six months, and systems have been operational on the container vessel Ever Top since 2024.

Ovrum emphasizes the technical progress and large-scale testing that could validate CO2 reduction technologies. DNV is actively engaged in developing the CCS supply chain, collaborating on over ten joint industry projects aimed at addressing key challenges in capture, transportation, and storage of CO2.",https://maritimefairtrade.org/wp-content/uploads/pwa/icon-192.png,N,,2025-12-31 20:56:50.847504

Additionally, air lubrication systems inject micro-bubbles beneath hulls, creating friction-reducing layers that decrease fuel consumption by 5-15%.
Data as collective intelligence We believe maritime decarbonization represents fundamentally a data challenge as much as a technology challenge.","The maritime industry now faces a pressing challenge: decarbonization. According to the International Maritime Organization’s 2024 Fourth Greenhouse Gas Study, the global merchant fleet accounts for approximately 3% of worldwide CO₂ emissions—roughly 1 billion tons annually. In response, the IMO’s revised strategy mandates achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by or around 2050, with intermediate targets requiring at least 40% reduction by 2030.

These realities therefore demand a shift from incremental efficiency improvements to transformative action based on alternative fuels, operational optimization, and data-driven decision-making.

Carbon neutrality in shipping rarely emerges from voluntary action alone. Rather, it results from converging pressures—regulatory, financial, and reputational. The IMO’s 2023 revised strategy represents the most ambitious decarbonization timeline in maritime history, requiring at least 20% GHG reduction by 2030 and 70% by 2040 compared to 2008 baselines.

Market-driven forces amplify regulatory mandates. For instance, the Poseidon Principles, adopted by financial institutions representing $185 billion in shipping portfolios, now require climate alignment assessments for financing. Moreover, Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) criteria increasingly determine access to capital, with investors scrutinizing emissions performance alongside traditional financial metrics. Meanwhile, the Sea Cargo Charter commits cargo owners to transparent emissions reporting, thereby creating competitive pressure on carriers to demonstrate verifiable reductions.

Regional regulations add immediate compliance urgency.

The European Union’s Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) extended to maritime transport in 2024, requiring shipping companies to surrender allowances for CO₂ emissions from EU port voyages. Similarly, the Fuel EU Maritime regulation establishes progressively stringent greenhouse gas intensity limits, declining to 80% reduction by 2050. When combined with Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII) ratings—which directly influence valuations and insurance premiums—these frameworks collectively create powerful economic incentives for decarbonization.

A compelling example is Maersk Line’s commitment to net-zero by 2040—ten years ahead of IMO goals. Achieving this required ordering methanol-capable vessels at 30% premium costs and establishing renewable methanol offtake agreements. Consequently, the company’s strategy illustrates how ambitious corporate targets can accelerate infrastructure development and technology adoption beyond regulatory minimums, demonstrating leadership in maritime decarbonization.

Achieving carbon neutrality requires moving beyond fossil fuels. Yet, no single alternative currently offers the energy density, handling characteristics, global availability, and cost competitiveness of heavy fuel oil. Therefore, the maritime industry faces a portfolio of potential solutions, each with distinct advantages and limitations across ship types and trade routes.

Liquefied natural gas (LNG) represents the most mature option, with approximately 300 LNG-fueled ships operating globally. LNG reduces CO₂ emissions by 20% compared to conventional fuels while virtually eliminating sulfur oxides. However, methane slip during combustion—methane being 28-36 times more potent than CO₂ as a greenhouse gas—significantly compromises lifecycle benefits. Accordingly, DNV’s Maritime Forecast positions LNG as transitional rather than ultimate solution.

Methanol emerges as particularly promising for medium-term decarbonization. Green methanol produced from renewable electricity and captured CO₂ achieves near-zero lifecycle emissions. The fuel remains liquid at ambient conditions, which in turn simplifies storage compared to cryogenic options. Maersk’s orders for methanol-capable craft reflect confidence in this pathway, though renewable methanol production remains insufficient for large-scale adoption.

Ammonia represents a potentially transformative long-term solution for deep-sea shipping. Containing no carbon, ammonia eliminates CO₂ emissions during combustion when properly managed. According to the IEA’s Net Zero by 2050 scenario, ammonia could fuel 45% of shipping energy demand by mid-century. Nevertheless, significant challenges remain: toxicity requires enhanced safety protocols, energy density is lower than conventional fuels, and combustion generates nitrous oxide requiring mitigation systems.

NYK Line and IHI Corporation’s 2024 ammonia-fueled tugboat trials demonstrated the first commercial-scale ammonia combustion in marine applications. In addition, the craft incorporated advanced safety monitoring and dual-fuel backup capability.

Biofuels and e-fuels offer drop-in compatibility with existing engines, potentially accelerating adoption. Yet, sustainable feedstock availability remains limited relative to maritime fuel demand. Furthermore, e-fuels require substantial renewable electricity—approximately 3-4 times the final fuel’s energy content. This creates cost challenges and competition with direct electrification of other transport sectors.

The fundamental reality is that no single fuel addresses all requirements. Consequently, short-sea shipping may adopt battery-electric propulsion; medium-range vessels might utilize methanol; and long-distance carriers could require synthetic fuels. This fragmentation multiplies infrastructure investment requirements and complicates global standardization.

Beyond fuel substitution, substantial emissions reductions derive from operational optimization and technological innovation. These approaches offer immediate implementation potential without waiting for new fuel infrastructure. Moreover, CII and EEXI regulations create compliance imperatives driving efficiency measure adoption across existing fleets.

Hydrodynamic optimization represents an accessible emissions reduction. Advanced computational fluid dynamics enables hull refinements reducing resistance by 5-10%. Additionally, air lubrication systems inject micro-bubbles beneath hulls, creating friction-reducing layers that decrease fuel consumption by 5-15%. Together, these improvements can reduce a ship’s emissions by 20-30% without fundamental propulsion changes.

Weather routing optimization leverages meteorological forecasting and oceanographic modeling to identify fuel-efficient passages. In this context, modern algorithms balance voyage duration against consumption, while accounting for wave heights, current patterns, and wind conditions. Consequently, studies document 3-8% fuel savings through optimized routing compared to great-circle navigation.

Predictive maintenance powered by artificial intelligence transforms traditional time-based schedules into condition-based interventions. By continuously monitoring engine parameters and performance indicators, operators can detect performance degradation early. Research demonstrates 4-7% consumption reductions through predictive maintenance compared to conventional practices.

Wärtsilä’s 2023 implementation of AI-powered voyage optimization across 50 container ships achieved remarkable results. Over twelve months, the fleet averaged 6.2% fuel consumption reduction and 8,400 tons CO₂ equivalent decrease. Moreover, economic savings exceeded $3.2 million, demonstrating environmental and financial alignment through intelligent optimization.

Wind-assisted propulsion technologies experience a renaissance through modern engineering. Rotor sails, rigid wing sails, and kite systems harness wind energy, supplementing mechanical propulsion. The International Windship Association reports that wind assistance reduces consumption by 10-30% depending on ship type and routes.

Despite technological feasibility, formidable economic barriers impede rapid decarbonization. The capital-intensive nature of shipping, long asset lifecycles, and fragmented ownership create inertia, which resists transformation. Understanding these impediments is therefore essential for designing effective interventions.

Vessel acquisition costs represent the most visible barrier. Alternative-fuel capable craft command 15-35% premiums over conventional designs. For large container vessels costing $150-200 million, premiums translate to an additional $25-60 million investment. Consequently, many operators—particularly small and medium companies—lack capital access without supportive financing.

Fuel cost uncertainties compound investment risks. New fuels like renewable ammonia and synthetic options currently cost 2-4 times conventional marine fuels. Shipowners making 20-30 year decisions confront trajectories that could render their fleet economically uncompetitive. As a result, this uncertainty paralyzes decision-making for operators lacking financial reserves.

Infrastructure requirements extend beyond the craft. Bunkering for these fuels requires specialized storage, transfer equipment, and safety systems. Moreover, the chicken-and-egg dilemma – vessels won’t order without bunkering availability, ports won’t invest without demand – delays ecosystem development. Breaking this impasse therefore requires coordinated public-private investment.

DFDS announced in 2023 that retrofitting existing craft would cost more than new construction while providing shorter lifespans. Consequently, the company committed to methanol-capable newbuilds while operating conventional ships until scheduled retirement. This pragmatic approach acknowledges retrofit limitations while advancing fleet decarbonization within economic constraints.

International competition creates carbon leakage risks. Stringent regulations may incentivize cargo routing through less-regulated jurisdictions. Accordingly, the OECD warns that asymmetric regulations could shift rather than reduce global emissions. This dynamic necessitates internationally coordinated policies preventing regulatory arbitrage.

Financing mechanisms must evolve to support decarbonization at required scales. The Climate Bonds Initiative estimates shipping requires $1-1.4 trillion investment by 2050. Hence, public development banks and multilateral institutions must provide concessional financing, thereby de-risking early investments. Additionally, carbon pricing generating transition support revenues could create self-funding frameworks.

Carbon neutrality depends fundamentally on comprehensive emissions quantification and operational optimization. In particular, data-driven decision-making transforms abstract commitments into measurable actions. Digital monitoring provides visibility, analytics, and predictive capabilities, which are essential for navigating regulatory landscapes while optimizing performance.

Regulatory compliance increasingly demands granular emissions reporting. The EU’s Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) regulation requires detailed fuel consumption and emissions data. Meanwhile, CII ratings—assigning craft grades A through E—directly influence valuations, insurance premiums, and chartering preferences. Therefore, maintaining favorable ratings requires continuous monitoring that exceeds traditional practices.

Real-time emissions monitoring enables proactive management rather than retrospective reporting. Modern platforms integrate AIS data tracking movements, fuel consumption sensors, and meteorological data. This synthesis calculates emissions with voyage-level granularity, thus identifying high-consumption segments for targeted improvements.

Predictive analytics transform historical performance into forward-looking guidance. Machine learning algorithms analyze relationships between speed, loading, weather, and consumption to recommend optimal parameters.

Moreover, these systems account for craft-specific characteristics—hull fouling, engine efficiency, trim optimization—thereby delivering personalized recommendations. Studies demonstrate that data-driven optimization reduces emissions 8-15% compared to conventional operations.

Sinay’s real-time monitoring solutions

Our implementation with a European short-sea operator demonstrated practical benefits of comprehensive digital monitoring. Specifically, the company deployed our integrated platform across 18 vessels, combining real-time emissions tracking with metocean analytics and route optimization. Over 18 months, the fleet achieved 11.3% average fuel consumption reduction, with a corresponding emissions decrease of approximately 14,800 tons CO₂ equivalent. Additionally, the system identified that speed reductions during specific weather conditions yielded disproportionate gains. Furthermore, automated regulatory reporting reduced administrative burden by 65%, allowing personnel reallocation to strategic sustainability initiatives.

The metocean analytics advantage

Our platform provides sophisticated environmental intelligence supporting route optimization and operational planning. High-resolution ocean current modeling, wave forecasting, and wind pattern prediction enable identification of fuel-efficient passages while accounting for performance characteristics. In addition, integration with emissions monitoring creates closed-loop optimization—recommended routes generate performance data that refines future predictions, continuously improving accuracy.

Data as collective intelligence

We believe maritime decarbonization represents fundamentally a data challenge as much as a technology challenge. Physical solutions largely exist; however, the persistent gap lies in systematic deployment guided by comprehensive performance visibility. Our platform democratizes access to sophisticated analytics, thereby enabling operators of all sizes to make evidence-based decarbonization decisions. This approach accelerates the transition through measurable, verifiable actions rather than aspirational commitments alone.",https://sinay.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/carbon-neutral-shipping.png,N,,2026-01-01 15:56:27.935769

During the first 11 months of the Panama Canal’s 2024-2025 fiscal year, which ends on September 30, 2025, 11,019 ships transited the canal. Of that total, 72.4% were Panamax vessels. The remaining 27.6% were Neopanamax.

In this context, the Panama Canal Authority indicated that, as of October 3, 2025, program participants will be able to access a weekly preferential quota. The mechanism operates through the transit reservation system. It also guarantees passage within 24 hours, just-in-time arrival service, and the option to exchange or replace vessels.

According to a report by ECLAC, in its first phase, the program will be open to ships with dual-fuel engines. These are vessels capable of operating with energies whose carbon intensity, measured under the “well-to-wake” approach, is equal to or less than 75 gCO₂e/MJ.

These energies include liquefied natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, methanol, and ammonia. The measure thus seeks to recognize early investments in low-carbon technologies.

Panama Canal

The Net Zero Quota program is part of the Panama Canal’s sustainability strategy. The goal is clear: to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. In this way, the canal reinforces its long-term climate agenda.

The initiative complements the efforts of the International Maritime Organization. In particular, those related to the development of a sustainable fuel certification system. This mechanism will standardize the measurement of greenhouse gas intensity used by ships.

With this system, the canal will be able to verify the suitability of vessels interested in programs such as Net Zero Quota. This strengthens its role as a laboratory for environmental innovation in global maritime trade.

At the same time, the economy showed greater dynamism. In the six months ending June 30, 2025, estimated GDP growth was 4.4%. A year earlier, it had been 2.0%.

The transportation, storage, and mail sector was one of the main drivers. In the same period, it grew by around 18.9% compared to 2024. The sector contributed 13.9% of GDP, driven by increased operations in the Panama Canal and greater dynamism in air transport.",https://8d073164.delivery.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Canal-de-Panama-Pixabay.jpg,N,,2025-12-31 18:56:48.731307

That pioneering spirit has led to a new development that has the potential to reshape the maritime industry for years to come. Japan Engine Corporation has completed the world’s first onland testing of a two-stroke hydrogen engine for the shipping industry. The company, along with its partners, has announced it will conduct real-world trials in the new year.

A consortium of Japanese companies has revealed an astonishing development

The consortium of companies, namely Japan Engine Corporation, Kawasaki Heavy Industries, and Yanmar Power Solutions, announced recently that they have completed onland trials for a maritime hydrogen engine that could potentially reshape the shipping industry. Japan relies heavily on the maritime industry for trade, as the nation is essentially an island with no immediate neighbors nearby.

The problem with that is the fact that the maritime industry produces vast amounts of emissions, as the huge container vessels pump out industrial-scale greenhouse gases. This has led the energy companies of the world to contemplate how to rework the engine used on ships to run on something other than diesel.

Japan is reshaping the marine engine industry with the astonishing new engine specifically designed to run on hydrogen

The consortium of companies announced that they have successfully completed the land-based trials for the new engine that will be able to run on both diesel and hydrogen, drastically reducing the emissions produced by the maritime industry. The testing was done at Japan Engine Corporation’s headquarters using a newly installed liquefied hydrogen fuel supply system.

The consortium plans to reach out to shipbuilding companies in the new year

Japan Engine Corporation has noted that, following the successful initial testing, the company will reach out to shipbuilding companies to facilitate real-world trials of the new hydrogen engines in 2026. The planned trials form part of a broader initiative by the government known as the Green Innovation Fund Projects / “Next-Generation Ship Development” initiative.

This specific project is called the Development of Marine Hydrogen Engine and MHFS, and will see Kawasaki supplying a liquefied hydrogen fuel system capable of storing and gasifying liquid hydrogen, which will then be fed to the engine at both high and low pressure.

This will allow for the evaluation of the system across several engine types, including but not limited to:

Low-speed two-stroke main propulsion models

Four-stroke auxiliary engines

Four-stroke generator engines for use in electric propulsion

With the world facing the uncomfortable reality that emissions are a top priority that needs to be addressed, the EU has awarded funding for several hydrogen projects under its NetZero program, pointing to the fact that the sector is changing for the better, according to some.

“Following land-based operations, the three companies plan to work with shiponwers and shipyards to conduct onboard trials and move forward with the practical implementation in society.” – Joint statement from the three companies

The Japanese government’s Green Innovation Fund is starting to produce results

The Japanese government established the Green Innovation Fund to facilitate investments in renewable energy projects through the Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI). The land of the rising sun is aiming to reach carbon neutrality by 2050, aligning with global standards and targets. Japan’s neighbor, China, recently unveiled its biggest operational green hydrogen and ammonia facility has received renewable certification from the EU, pointing to regional embrace of the new and untapped power that hydrogen has across several sectors.

A pioneering project

The plant, located in Ramme (western Jutland), was driven by the collaboration between Topsoe, Skovgaard Energy, Vestas, and the Danish public program EUDP. Unlike conventional facilities designed to operate at constant load, this plant adjusts its green ammonia production in real-time according to the fluctuations of available wind and solar energy.

Total flexibility: synchronizes water electrolysis (to obtain green hydrogen) with ammonia synthesis, avoiding the need to oversize batteries or hydrogen tanks.

Practical efficiency: when the wind blows strong, it harnesses the renewable surplus; when production decreases, it reduces its activity without compromising the stability of the chemical process.

Relevance of green ammonia

Green ammonia has been identified for years as a key energy vector to decarbonize sectors that are difficult to electrify:

Agricultural fertilizers.

Maritime transport.

Intensive industrial processes.

The challenge was not the concept, but the execution. This project demonstrates that industrial chemistry can be flexible and operate without fossil backup, changing the landscape of the energy transition.

Local and strategic impact

The CEO of Skovgaard Energy emphasized the impact on innovation, employment, and development in a rural area, recalling that the energy transition also involves creating value in the territories.

Beyond the technical advancement, the plant reinforces European energy autonomy:

Green ammonia can be produced locally.

It is easily stored and transported, without the complexities of pure hydrogen.

In a context of geopolitical tensions and volatile energy prices, having renewable synthetic fuels produced at home becomes a strategic issue.

Advantages of the dynamic model

The approach opens the door to smaller, distributed, and territorially connected plants, instead of centralized megaprojects:

Production close to consumption.

Less transportation and losses.

Greater energy resilience.

In the short term, it can facilitate the use of green ammonia as maritime fuel in European ports, reducing emissions on key trade routes. In the medium term, it promises to transform the fertilizer industry, responsible for a significant portion of agricultural emissions.",https://storage.googleapis.com/media-cloud-na/2025/12/amoniaco-verde.webp,N,,2025-12-31 07:57:02.084235
