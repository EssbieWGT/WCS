At London International Shipping Week’s ShipZERO30 Workshop, the IMO was the stage for innovators and disruptors to showcase the cutting-edge solutions that deliver a healthy ocean and a profitable future.

IMO’s secretary-general Arsenio Dominguez opened the workshop by reminding delegates of the IMO’s responsibility “to reduce emissions and achieve our goals in order to protect the planet for future generations”, calling on industry innovators “to continue to be the early movers” in shaping decision-making at the IMO, and underling that “this transition can only succeed if it is safe”.

The workshop presented successful real-life vessels, primary wind-powered commercial ocean-going cargo ships, hybrid battery-hydrogen fuel cell propulsion and mobile green hydrogen generation at sea, each built on decades of proven technology. The message was clear: The transformation of maritime transport is not only feasible, it is here, and the business case is real.

Kishan Muthu, head of SeaLabs at global shipowner Union Maritime, kicked off proceedings by sharing the formidable emissions reductions and fuel cost savings with BAR Technologies guaranteeing minimum 1.5 tons fuel reduction per day per WindWing and Norsepower Rotor Sails measuring five to 25 percent fuel savings – all on retrofits of ocean-going tankers and dry bulkers.

When the power of the wind is maximized through design of a new build, the results are staggering: 80 to 90 percent fuel reductions seen on the Neoline Origin, currently under sea trials in Türkiye and due to enter RoRo service in the Atlantic by the end of the year. On top of savings, shipowners benefit greatly from the EU ETS and coming IMO Net Zero Framework.

The message from the panelists was clear: “Wind works and is here to stay”.

The effectiveness, maturity and commercialization of wind propulsion makes the case for a HyWindship, a vessel combining hydrogen and wind for propulsion to achieve absolute zero emissions, is evident: With such dramatic fuel reductions, the quantity of expensive green hydrogen and the supply chain issues are manageable.

Danielle Southcott of Veer Voyage made clear their Design Number 1, which integrates large-scale wind propulsion with hydrogen fuel cells and batteries, can provide absolute zero emissions transport across diverse cargo types and is only one charterer signature away from the shipyard.

Kim Nguyen, project manager at LH2 Shipping, removed any remaining doubt concerning hydrogen’s potential as a reliable absolute zero emissions fuel. Their Hydra RoPax vessel in Norway has been operating since 2023 with 98 percent uptime – the best performance in Norled’s entire fleet of nearly 80 electric and diesel-powered vessels.

Bunkering is completed every two weeks and fills the four-ton tank in just one hour. Zero boil-off gas is achieved during sailing, and just 0.5 percent observed in bunkering, meaning costs are minimised. She finished by making clear that “scale up is not more complicated”, as proven by their two zero-emissions wind-assisted container ships for Samskip, under construction and entering service between Oslo and Rotterdam from Q4 2026.

Hydrogen heavyweights Chart Industries, Air Liquide and Kawasaki Heavy Industries, detailed how supply chain challenges have been met and overcome for years, while Norwegian green hydrogen producer Gen2 Energy’s EVP of project development, Lars Nesje Grimsmo, made clear that through unlocking coastal transport of renewable hydrogen delivered straight into ports, “shipping will be first in line for hydrogen”.

These breakthroughs show how collaboration across shipowners, insurers, supply chains, and policymakers can unlock fresh opportunities for financing and technology adoption.

As Madadh MacLaine, secretary general of ZESTAs, put it: “As we push down the curve, accelerating the trajectory toward steep emissions reductions, supported by IMO regulations, ZESTAs is keeping that cutting edge sharp, creating a pathway that the entire maritime industry can follow.”

Debates throughout the day brought capital markets, technology, and operations together, shaping a common language for an emerging ecosystem — a pathway to a new ocean asset class where profitability and ocean stewardship go hand in hand.

International Maritime Organization (IMO) Net- zero Framework (NZF) is said to hold great promise for climate action in the form of green shipping, but there is great uncertainty surrounding its future. What was supposed to be a step towards establishing a global legally binding framework to decarbonise global shipping has been halted by the threat of tariffs and other punitive measures by the United States (U.S.) on countries that support the undertaking. Notably, the U.S. was not alone in thwarting IMO members’ shipping carbon reduction efforts, as Saudi Arabia, a leading petroleum power, proposed the motion to delay voting on the adoption of the agreement for a year, and many countries backtracked on their initial support. The balancing act involved in global climate efforts, in this case, attempts at decarbonising shipping, and economic interests, is always one worth exploring, as interests matter and this is demonstrated by the results of this initiative. In this article, I explore the interests and the costs of this framework.

Unpacking the IMO Net-zero Framework

The IMO Net-zero Framework was approved for circulation by the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) at its Eighty-Third session in April 2025 to set international standards geared towards curbing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the shipping sector. Poised to form part of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollutiofrom Ships (MARPOL), Annex VI, the draft legal text was circulated and due for adoption in October 2025, but it stalled due to resistance by concerned members. Over 100 member states gathered in London to vote on the draft document, with 57 countries supporting adjournment, 49 opposing it, and 21 abstaining.

At the centre of its opposition are the two key elements of the framework, namely, a global fuel standard and an economic measure geared towards reducing carbon emissions from ships. Essentially, the fuel standard sets the rules to get vessels, over time, to minimise the GHG emissions per unit of energy used, and it considers emissions through the entire life-cycle of fuel from production to consumption. The economic measure refers to a two-tiered pollution system with annually increasing GHG Fuel Intensity (GFI) targets, which prescribe maximum limits on GHG emissions per unit for large vessels over 5,000 gross tonnage which emit 85% of carbon dioxide, the most prevalent anthropogenic (man-made) greenhouse gas. This mechanism is based on a carbon credits trading scheme, where a set number of credits is allocated to ships. Ships emitting above their GFI thresholds (exceeding their credits) will be required to purchase remedial units to cover the excess.

In simple terms, think of it as a bank account; in this case, the ship has a certain amount of money (GHG emission limit) to participate in shipping, and if the ship goes over, it would be synonymous with having an overdrawn account and would accrue a penalty. In this case, the shipping company pays the penalty in the form of remedial units to offset going beyond the limit.

Conversely, vessels with lower emissions benefit financially through a rewards system, earning credits, with the option of selling their credits to vessels with high emissions. Consequently, ships that exceed set limits have to pay, while those that are net zero or near net zero benefit. Under this framework, the money paid for exceeding limits would go into the IMO-Net Zero Fund. This fund is then used to reward ships with low emissions, support member states’ NZF transition and any other associated initiatives. Employing such measures is believed to be a force for driving clean shipping, fostering technological innovation in sustainable shipping and facilitating capacity building (much like the Caribbean Shipping Lanes Project). This sounds quite doable; pay when you pollute in excess. However, states like the U.S. are concerned with the costs for paying ‘the cost’.

Costs for Paying ‘the cost’

While NZF proponents see the merit of the proposed system in fostering GHG emissions reductions, U.S. President Donald Trump views it as a “Global Green New Scam Tax”. The U.S. Department of State dubbed what, if adopted, could have been the world’s first global environmental tax an injurious initiative. Washington suggests that the NZF could have an adverse trickle-down effect on the American people and the global economy through increased shipping costs. As a result, the U.S. threatened retaliatory measures against states voting in favour of the draft text in the form of visa restrictions and sanctions on state officials, blocking and increasing port fees on vessels from such states, and commercial penalties. What is noteworthy is that Caribbean states, Antigua and Barbuda and the Bahamas, opted to abstain citing transitional concerns, notwithstanding their advocacy for climate change. Also interesting is that China, a trading powerhouse, initially supported the plan but then changed its position.

To say that the concerns about the potential increases in energy and consumer prices are illegitimate would be disingenuous, as this has been a primary concern for many. Based on calculations from the Center on Global Energy Policy (CGEP) at Columbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs, a vessel utilising the IMO’s recommended environmentally friendly very low sulfur fuel could face an additional $1.5 million in annual operating expenses.

There is a high likelihood that the costs could be passed on to consumers in the form of higher merchandise prices. This will ultimately affect import-dependent countries such as those in the Caribbean. Moreover, the ability of firms to acquire vessels with green technology or upgrade them to support the green shipping transition is also a consideration. Then there are petroleum states, such as Saudi Arabia and increasingly Guyana, which stand to be adversely affected as

their oil sectors are a central part of their economies. However, while transition costs are an essential consideration, so are the real and lived experiences of the effects of climate change.

The Climate Cost

Economists argue that there are opportunity costs for choices made, and the same can be applied in balancing the priorities for economic growth with the environment. Although Caribbean states have not historically contributed to climate change, for all of them, the effects are real and lived experiences. Faced with supersonic monster hurricanes, like hurricane Melissa that ravaged Caribbean countries in October 2025, rising sea levels, droughts and increased temperatures, coastal erosion, progress in climate change adaptation is a matter of lives and livelihood. At the same time, many Caribbean countries are import-reliant economies and the effects of the NZF can appear daunting.

Power politics always seem to stymy adaptation progress, from the 1982 UN Law of the Sea, to the 2015 Paris Agreement, and now the pause in the IMO NZF. In this matter, the concerns raised have some legitimacy. IMO members should use this pause to work through the questions and issues of members with an aim to get closer to a plan that can see the reduction of GHG in shipping. Every effort on every front counts, on the journey to sustainability.

Life extension and conversion to existing tonnage in our repair yards can educate the political leaders on how to solve the problems.
The Cargo Authority approvals can range between confirming proper cargo tank coatings, stainless steel cargo systems, cargo pump capability and IBC code requirements.
To support our domestic markets, we turn to tug & barge in an attempt to solve both of those problems.
The selection of life extension and conversion resulted in a greater than 60% reduction in the asset capital cost when delivered.","We are well into the discussions advising shipbuilders and operators how the U.S. will create a renaissance of the maritime industry. Federal Legislation, Executive Orders, and new foreign partnerships driving the promise of commercial competitiveness with the leading global shipbuilders. Most of the shipbuilding rhetoric indicates the domestic markets will be left to survive on their own. This despite the fact the domestic operators and builders have proven to be the strongest undercurrent to decisions and amendments on the legislation efforts.

It is year-end here at Maritime Reporter & Engineering News. With that gathering of actual shipbuilders and operators comes the end of the political storytelling and the announcements of who is building and who is not. In our opinion 2026 will fall into who is not as the geopolitical rhetoric continues. Unfortunately, the problem is not the builders, not the owners or managers and in some cases not the markets. It is just mass political confusion of what direction the industry is going to take and how we build a supply chain or manufacturing base to support and meet the White House goals. Life extension and conversion to existing tonnage in our repair yards can educate the political leaders on how to solve the problems.

Year End: The Storm Looms

Let’s concentrate on the home front and the domestic projects developing beyond the stories of new construction shipyards competing for Navy and USCG work now coupled with new foreign partners promising global competitiveness. We are still asking where is the support of our commercial fleet and most look to lucrative Navy contract.

Domestic trading opportunities are developing as historical clean and dirty petroleum products are slowly accompanied by chemical and gas. In the chemical markets few if any of the existing domestic barges are capable of transporting new bio fuels, chemicals and or base products. The Cargo Authority approvals can range between confirming proper cargo tank coatings, stainless steel cargo systems, cargo pump capability and IBC code requirements. Despite the now “one-year delay” in meeting the IMO MEPC net zero wish list, new cargoes will continue to develop.

Despite the MEPC vote to delay the position on carbon tax and emissions, the foreign tonnage entering the U.S coasts will require new bunkering sources to address alternative fuels. With that necessity, coastwise registered domestic vessels will need to distribute these cargoes from one U.S. port to another. With our lessons learned identifying the U.S. manufacturing base and supply chain is one of the lead problems with our shipbuilding growth, there are other commodities that will also increase in demand globally and can move to rebuild U.S. infrastructure and manufacturing.

Hopefully the geopolitical discussions in our government departments will wake up to the fact that Gaza needs to be rebuilt and at some point, Ukraine. With that wakeup call, new legislation to support the effort and demand U.S. material be required, can work towards agreements that these goods will be delivered to on new U.S. Flag tonnage. Not an absurd request considering the cost of military equipment and funding the U.S. has provided to both regions. Russia has a ghost fleet, with tariffs and taxes, the global trading patterns are changing and U.S. maritime needs to step to the front of the line with support of our Navy.

LNG has been addressed with capable bunkering tonnage provided. A move to Ammonia, Hydrogen, Methanol or the simplest of alternative fuels in the U.S. fleet has not. Make no mistake, there is no domestic customer base to build or charter new “Bluewater” ship tonnage at the current prices estimated to build that tonnage. The commercial trading markets can’t absorb both the construction Capex and the full crew compliment of US ship operation. To support our domestic markets, we turn to tug & barge in an attempt to solve both of those problems.

None of this should be a surprise.

ATBs: The Future Domestic Coastwise Fleet

The purpose of the Articulated Tug & Barge design developed in 1950 and further advanced in the 1970’s and 1980’s was to provide additional operational performance beyond historic tug tow line. In 1981, the USCG recognizing the ATB safety advantages and created new regulatory amendments that affected crew size and inspection criteria.

Make no mistake, with new ship construction current price levels, the ATB is our future domestic coastwise fleet. The next steps should be the continued pursuit to elevate designs and work towards becoming more efficient in ATB construction. It is not only “Bluewater” costs that are rising. It is also “Brownwater”. And with that, we are seeing a transition period develop with projects addressing life extension and conversion of existing ATB tonnage while the cargo priorities shift from historical petroleum products to a new set of commodities in wet markets.

AMTECH developed an ATB life extension and conversion project in mid-2024 with Marathon Asset Management of New York and Gulf Marine Repair in Tampa, Florida. The business model included the purchase of an existing 155,000-barrel petroleum barge and Articulated Tug along with a design proposal to convert the vessel to trade soft chemicals. The selected tonnage was idle in layup and eighteen years of age when purchased. A 15-year life extension was targeted for the reconstruction.

The business model was developed based upon the purchase of existing tonnage and conversion compared to the estimated cost of new construction. Cost estimates were provided by several U.S. yards. The selection of life extension and conversion resulted in a greater than 60% reduction in the asset capital cost when delivered.

The project development took into account every shipbuilding issue debated in Washington, DC circles over the past 12 months and with that a “lessons learned” of what our actual “shipbuilding” problems are were well defined. It is an underdeveloped manufacturing base and a supply chain of near zero. We still need foreign support from our allies.

Three hundred and twenty tons of steel were renewed after extensive gauging and survey. All of the steel was renewed in a U.S. shipyard with U.S. labor. In the logistics category, the purchase and delivery of steel was identified as a major problem and most was delivered from foreign sources despite a request that no Chinese steel be supplied. A complete redesign of the cargo piping system was completed in 316 stainless steel. Stainless pipe, fittings and valves were near nonexistent in U.S. inventory. The supply chain delivery quotes in these categories were 18 to 30 weeks. If purchased foreign, extended delays exist to request of Imperial standards versus global metric.

Cargo tanks reconstruction was specifically targeted to support an investment with Advanced Polymer Marine Line tank coatings to allow the carriage of new cargoes. This is the first U.S tank barge project applied with Marine Line in the United States to support the commercial and trading applications. Anchor Sandblasting & Coating of Tampa agreed to take on the project and our Amtech South Korea teams provided previous coating experience from our new construction contracts in Hyundai. Anchor Sandblasting & Coating attended shipyards in Turkey to complete the training and take part in coating repairs during the attendance. The selection of Marine Line was an important part of the conversion. The polymer coating provides superior resistance to corrosion and wear, a faster cleaning surface and upgrades to cargo sequencing.

Our Korean teams could not obtain Visa(s) under current immigration issues in the U.S. If U.S shipbuilding is determined to partner and learn from the Far East global shipbuilding powerhouses – H1 Visa approval for professional engineers, trainers and educators is paramount for the advancement of new technologies applied in the Far East.

The project did not experience a lack of labor at Gulf Marine. When schedule advances were required, additional labor was made available. The quality of the work we inspected and approved in near every trade was well above satisfactory. The American shipyard worker can do the job and the Port of Tampa continues to be “shipbuilding” supportive.",https://images.marinelink.com/images/maritime/w800/image-courtesy-165120.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 20:56:42.423212

LNG-fuelled vessels dominated the month’s activity with 26 orders, all from the container segment. The remaining four orders were for methanol-fuelled vessels, with three in the tankers segment.

Despite October’s uptick, the year-to-date picture remains subdued. A total of 222 orders for alternative-fuelled vessels were placed in the first 10 months of 2025, representing just 52% of orders placed during the same period in 2024. LNG-fuelled vessels continue to lead with 67% of all alternative-fuel orders this year, totaling 147 ships. Methanol-fuelled vessels follow with 47 orders, while LPG carriers account for 19, ammonia-fuelled vessels for 5, and hydrogen-fuelled vessels for 4.

The container segment now dominates alternative-fuel vessel orders, accounting for 65% of all new orders in 2025.

Infrastructure investment also advanced in October, with four LNG bunker vessels and two bunker vessels capable of supplying methanol and biofuel added to the orderbook. While these vessels are not included in alternative-fuelled vessel statistics, they represent continued commitment to supporting the emerging alternative-fuelled fleet.

Jason Stefanatos, Global Decarbonization Director at DNV Maritime, welcomed the improvement while acknowledging ongoing challenges. “Following some weak months, it is encouraging to see stronger numbers in the alternative-fuelled space in October, both for vessels and with further investment in bunkering infrastructure. While activity remains well below last year’s levels, it is important to recognize that this is happening within a weaker overall newbuild market,” Stefanatos said.

Regulatory uncertainty has been identified as a key factor affecting market sentiment. Stefanatos previously noted that “uncertainties around the IMO’s Net-Zero Framework, including lifecycle assessment factors for certain fuels, are prompting many owners to adopt a ‘wait and see’ approach to new orders.”

Last month, the IMO postponed the adoption of its Net-Zero Framework by one year following pressure from the United States, Saudi Arabia, and other countries, pushing the adoption vote to October 2026. The framework aims to bring international shipping emissions down to net zero by 2050 and would create the world’s first global carbon pricing mechanism for shipping, with revenues expected to reach up to $15 billion annually from 2030.

“Although issues of regulatory uncertainty are yet to be solved, the push for maritime decarbonization continues, led by the container segment and driven by a range of actors, including cargo owners, financiers, and shipowners themselves. This continued commitment across the industry signals that the transition to cleaner fuels remains firmly on the agenda,” Stefanatos added.

The IMO will reconvene for technical working group talks from April 20-24, 2026, followed by the 84th session of the Marine Environment Protection Committee from April 27 to May 1.",https://gcaptain.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/shutterstock_1925152076-800x391.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 13:59:58.251418

Delegates at the International Maritime Organization (I.M.O.), a United Nations body that regulates international shipping, voted 57-49 to delay adopting the Net Zero Framework (N.Z.F.) by at least a year, postponing rules that would have required ships to cut emissions starting in 2028. The framework, which was first agreed upon in April 2025, aimed to make shipping the first global industry with binding climate regulations, including a carbon-pricing system to incentivize cleaner fuels and penalize harmful excess emissions.

International leaders reacted quickly with divided responses. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio praised the delay as “another huge win” for Trump, commending the president for protecting American consumers from what he called a “Global Green New Scam Tax on Shipping,” according to PBS News. In contrast, European Commission Executive Vice President Teresa Ribera described the delay as “a huge shame” and reaffirmed Europe’s commitment to ambitious global climate standards (Politico). Based on AP News, Ralph Regenvanu, Vanuatu’s Minister for Climate Change, called the decision “unacceptable given the urgency we face in light of accelerating climate change,” noting that island nations are already confronting rising seas and extreme weather events. Environmental NGOs (non-governmental organizations) like Transport & Environment and Opportunity Green expressed extreme concern that the delay jeopardizes efforts to reduce emissions, as Alison Shaw of Transport & Environment states, “The delay leaves the shipping sector drifting in uncertainty. But this week has also shown that there is a clear desire to clean up the shipping industry, even in the face of U.S. bullying,” according to PBS News.

This outcome is concerning from a climate perspective. The N.Z.F. was designed to create uniform regulations that would have allowed shipping companies to invest in greener technologies. Thomas Kazakos, Secretary-General of the International Chamber of Shipping, emphasized that “industry needs clarity to be able to make the investments needed to decarbonize the maritime sector,” as noted by the BBC. By succumbing to pressure from fossil-fuel-producing nations, the I.M.O. missed an opportunity to enforce global standards and encourage the use of alternative fuels like ammonia and methanol. While the U.S. celebrated the decisions as a protection of domestic economic interests, the broader consequence is a delay in global efforts to combat climate change, which puts vulnerable communities, especially in the Pacific and the Caribbean, at extreme risk.

The conflict comes from rising tensions between the need to address climate change, the desire of countries to protect their economies, and the influence of global political power. It shows the flash of governmental goals, money, and politics. Shipping currently accounts for approximately 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions, and without any intervention, the I.M.O. has projected that these emissions could grow by 10% and even up to 150% by 2050, according to BBC reporting. The N.Z.F. would have required ships to gradually transition away from the use of heavy fuel oil, impose fees for extra carbon emissions, and encourage support for using cleaner fuel alternatives. Countries including China, the European Union, Brazil, and the U.K. support the plan, while Saudi Arabia, Russia, and the U.S. oppose it, worrying about costs and effects on the economy. Based on AP News reporting, this is similar to previous international negotiations, such as the failed global plastic treaty earlier in 2025, where the U.S. and Saudi Arabia blocked regulations even though most countries agreed that there was urgent environmental action needed.",https://theowp.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/0_wmDPQ-UpLBV7413M.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 13:04:09.532060

Fortescue is disappointed by the delay in adopting the International Maritime Organization’s Net-Zero Framework, a landmark proposal that would have set global shipping on a clear course toward decarbonization. While some countries chose to defer progress, the direction of travel for shipping is already clear. The transition to zero-emission fuels is inevitable.

The Green Pioneer is at COP30 to show that the technologies to enable it already exist and Fortescue remains firmly committed to demonstrating what is possible through their own green shipping program.",https://images.marinelink.com/images/maritime/w800/fortescue-green-165113.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 12:00:15.891505

This delay raises concerns that regional legislation and Emission Trading Schemes (ETS) may emerge as alternatives to the anticipated global framework. The European Union’s ETS, initially viewed as a temporary measure, is now poised to take center stage as a model for other regions.

New EU Guidelines on Methane Reporting

On October 8, 2025, the European Commission unveiled its Guidelines for Reporting and Verification of Actual Methane Slip Factors. This marks a pivotal moment for shipowners, allowing them to substitute conservative default methane values with actual measured data, verified in line with IMO Resolution MEPC.402(83). Previously, the FuelEU default tables focused solely on carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions, neglecting methane slip (CH₄) and nitrous oxide (N₂O) factors associated with various renewable fuels, including bio- and e-methanol, ammonia, hydrogen, and dual-fuel engines.

The absence of verified data for these fuels could lead to inaccuracies in greenhouse gas (GHG) intensity reporting, potentially exposing shipowners to higher emissions costs. Fortunately, the IMO MEPC.402(83) provides a framework for measuring both methane and nitrous oxide emissions onboard vessels. The new EU guidelines outline how to report verified CH₄ factors under FuelEU, with procedures for N₂O expected to follow shortly. Existing technology, such as VPS Emsys, can continuously measure and verify emissions of CH₄, CO₂, and N₂O, while automatically generating a Methane File ready for verification.

Carbon Capture, New Fuels and Energy Efficiency Are the Path to Net Zero Says Latest ABS Research

As the shipping industry prepares for the EU ETS 2026 cycle, which will include pricing and verification of all combustion-related GHGs, it is crucial for shipowners and operators to act swiftly. Currently, FuelEU lacks default methane or nitrous oxide factors for new fuels, making accurate GHG accounting essential to minimize ETS exposure. VPS EMSYS offers a comprehensive measurement framework that aligns with IMO 402(83) and is designed to accommodate future FuelEU verification requirements.

The Secretary General of the Maritime Organisation of West and Central Africa (MOWCA), Dr. Paul Adalikwu has opened talks with the Chief Executive of Singaporean Maritime and Ports Authority, Mr. Ang Wee Keong.

At a bilateral meeting in Singapore, Adalikwu called for technical collaboration with Singaporean authorities, known for its efficient and modernised port system while seeking that such standards be replicated in MOWCA member countries.

Specifically, the MOWCA SG called for closer working ties and requested expertise of the Singaporean authorities in areas of human capital development, infrastructural upgrade and maintenance and cargo handling.

Dr. Adalikwu who also spoke on the importance of a maritime single window and digitalisation of port processes, harped on the need for harmonisation and single document submission for seamless end to end processing of import and export procedures in ports.

Speaking on environment friendly shipping, specifically addressing Green House Gas (GHG), Dr. Adalikwu told Keong that MOWCA fully aligns with the International Maritime Organisation policy to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from shipping by or around 2050.

The new extraordinary session, scheduled to take place in twelve months, offers Member States the opportunity to continue working toward broader consensus on the content and structure of the NZF. According to the statement, looking back at recent developments regarding the NZF, the decision to postpone, while delaying final decisions, simultaneously provides valuable time—recognized as necessary— for the international shipping community to conduct further analysis, collaboration, and development of practical solutions that ensure an effective, balanced, and pragmatic transition of shipping toward decarbonization.

The Cyprus Shipping Industry, has long played a significant role in the country’s economic and social development. To continue growing sustainably and maintain its competitiveness, it requires a clear and global regulatory framework, which can only be provided through a coordinated, IMO-led mechanism.

The absence of such a framework increases the risk of fragmentation through regional or unilateral measures, which could lead to higher costs, loss of competitiveness, and regulatory uncertainty. In contrast, a common, balanced, and internationally accepted approach would send a clear message of unity and determination from the global shipping industry to move forward in a coordinated manner toward the shared goal.

The Chamber remains steadfastly committed to this direction and reiterates its dedication to continue working with consistency, responsibility and a collaborative spirit, as it has done for over 36 years, towards a sustainable, competitive and internationally harmonised shipping sector, which represents the common objective of all stakeholders.

According to Greek shipbroker Intermodal, these plans target modernising shipyards, including replacing outdated machinery, installing larger cranes and adopting advanced automation and digital technologies.

Additionally, the Japanese government has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the United States to expand collaboration, with Washington pursuing similar opportunities with South Korea.

A new chapter in innovation

These investments are centered on technological innovation. “Japan’s industry is advancing zero-emissions vessels, autonomous ships and IoT-enabled solutions through collaborations with R&D centres, universities and think tanks,” said Intermodal senior analyst Nikos Tagoulis.

By 2040, Japan aims to become a leader in autonomous and zero-emissions shipbuilding, targeting half of its domestic fleet to be autonomous.

“Rather than prioritising sheer production volume, the focus is on innovation and value-added technological solutions that enhance both vessel performance and overall quality,” Mr Tagoulis added.

He noted while Japan’s global market share may remain broadly stable, eco-friendly technologies, efficiency-enhancing solutions and strategic partnerships could boost profitability and reinforce its international standing.

Fallen share and market challenges

“These efforts come as Japan seeks to regain ground in a shipbuilding landscape that has shifted dramatically over the past two decades,” Mr Tagoulis said.

Intermodal data shows that while Japan once commanded more than 35% of new orders, its share has declined from 26% in 2017 to just over 10% as of October 2025, coinciding with rapid growth in China.

The Japanese orderbook currently comprises 737 vessels totalling 40.7M dwt, primarily bulk carriers, tankers and container ships. Regarding alternative fuels, 10% of vessels may use methanol and approximately 4% are LNG-capable. Moreover, 32% of ordered tonnage will be scrubber-fitted.

Consolidation amid structural constraints

In response to market pressures, Japan’s shipbuilding sector has undergone consolidations to sustain competitiveness.

Significant developments include Imabari Shipbuilding increasing its stake in Japan Marine United, while Mitsui E&S has gradually scaled back operations, closing its Chiba yard and transferring most newbuilding activities to Tsuneishi. Similarly, Sasebo Heavy Industries exited newbuilding in 2022, shifting focus to repairs and machinery.

However, structural challenges persist. “Limited coastal space restricts new shipyard expansion, though upgrade investments aim to increase capacity at existing facilities,” Mr Tagoulis highlighted.

Additionally, an ageing workforce has prompted the industry to recruit foreign workers, who now comprise roughly 20% of the workforce, up from virtually zero a decade ago, Intermodal data shows. Specialised training centres have also been established to support skills development.",https://dvzpv6x5302g1.cloudfront.net/AcuCustom/Sitename/DAM/174/Oshim1_Thumb.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 12:00:21.674793

LNG-fuelled vessels account for roughly two-thirds (67%) of these, while container ships represent 65% of the total. Although these figures represent a noticeable decline from the same period in 2024, down 52%, DNV attributes this largely to a weakening in the wider newbuild market rather than a shift away from alternative fuels.

The October orderbook also saw the addition of four LNG bunker vessels and two methanol-capable bunker vessels, highlighting ongoing investment in fuel infrastructure.

“We analysed the vessel’s operational profile, defined goals and the constraints of implementing new technology,” Mr Scheid explained.
Sofar’s Mr Rong said dynamic route optimisation results in around 5-8% fuel savings on average per vessel and voyage.
“High-quality vessel models, weather forecasts and optimised waypoint suggestions means Wayfinder helps reduce fuel and emissions during voyages,” said Mr Rong.
These modelling programs and expert insight will help owners “get through dark forests of technologies,” said Mr Rong.","Mr Scheid spoke about retrofitting vessels with technologies in a phased scheme to reduce fuel consumption and emissions and to remain compliant with EU and IMO environmental regulations. These solutions require capital expenditure with months or years before seeing a return on investment (RoI), which should be shared between owner and charterer.

“Decarbonisation is a burden on shipping, but it is also an opportunity to save money,” Mr Scheid said.

There are several challenges to decarbonisation compliance, including finding the most suitable products for ships in a fleet with different operational performance, trading patterns and commercial arrangements.

“There are dozens of technologies to reduce CO2, but not all will be applicable to all vessel types and many are new and untested,” said Mr Scheid. “When there is pressure on compliance, waiting is not an option as it increases risk and costs.”

Mr Scheid gave a case study involving a shipmanager seeking to upgrade a Kamsarmax bulk carrier to improve its carbon intensity index (CII) rating into the mid-2030s.

“We can act like a lighthouse, showing a clear path through the decarbonisation storm”

Without applying technology, this 82,000-dwt ship would have slipped into a CII D rating in 2027 and an E rating in 2029, resulting in the owner having to scrap it seven years earlier than anticipated.

Glo Marine analysed the available technologies, simulating their impact on CII and emissions, and provided the shipmanager with a three-phased approach to keeping this 230-m ship compliant until 2035.

“We analysed the vessel’s operational profile, defined goals and the constraints of implementing new technology,” Mr Scheid explained. “We shortlisted the most promising technologies and engaged around 20 manufacturers for vessel-specific changes and performance expectations.”

Glo Marine recommended the first phase of investment in 2026 to be installing ultrasound hull and propeller protection and a propeller boss cap, at a cost of around US$460,000 to reduce fuel consumption and emissions, with RoI in 14 months. The next phase in 2029 willl see ducts and fins installed on the propulsion system at US$200,000, with nine months cost recovery. A third phase in 2031 includes installing a US$1.4M air-lubrication system on the hull to reduce friction and fuel consumption, which could take two years RoI, but extend the ship’s C-rating to 2033 and commercial life to 2035.

“We can act like a lighthouse, showing a clear path through the decarbonisation storm, and provide a road map for existing vessels,” said Mr Scheid. “Owners can spread costs, so it is not all at once, to gain peace of mind for compliance and extend the lifetime of vessels.”

Weather routeing

Voyage optimisation and weather routeing can enable shipowners and operators to reduce fuel consumption and emissions, with far less cost.

Sofar’s Mr Rong said dynamic route optimisation results in around 5-8% fuel savings on average per vessel and voyage. The company has deployed thousands of ocean sensors for more than 75% global coverage to produce weather forecasts and provide intelligence on sea conditions.

“High-quality vessel models, weather forecasts and optimised waypoint suggestions means Wayfinder helps reduce fuel and emissions during voyages,” said Mr Rong.

Weather routeing can be integrated with other decarbonisation technologies such as wind-assisted propulsion.

“We can optimise routes in real-time,” said Mr Rong. “When sails are added, this changes the dynamics of where to sail the ship, so they ride the weather and waves of storms.”

By optimising routes for ships with rotor, wing or suction sails, owners and operators can save a considerable amount of fuel, said Mr Rong.

“Over time, we can identify and develop a breakdown of fuel savings, which can be as high as 20% on certain days, depending on wind and sea conditions.”

Before owners invest in sails, they can use voyage optimisation software to simulate routes as if they had sails and determine the future benefits. These modelling programs and expert insight will help owners “get through dark forests of technologies,” said Mr Rong.",https://dvzpv6x5302g1.cloudfront.net/AcuCustom/Sitename/DAM/183/Juice_carrier_with_Bound4blue_rotor_sails_on_board1_Thumb.png,N,,2025-11-03 07:56:15.142656

“This pause does not affect Singapore’s efforts and the work already underway to support the decarbonisation of international shipping,” the MPA spokesperson said. “By the final day of the IMO meeting, the mood was no longer conducive for a vote on the adoption of the Net-Zero Framework. Singapore assessed that, on balance, deferring the vote would best preserve the progress already made on the NZF, allow Member States additional time to bridge remaining differences, and help ensure that when adopted, the NZF has broad and durable support from across the IMO membership.”

IMO’s adoption of the NZF was “supposed to be a milestone for shipping,” said Joey Ng, global head of decarbonization and fuel transition for shipbroker Braemar.

“What is now made crystal clear is that the flags will take the lead in terms and carbon will be regulated regionally and locally,” Ng said. “There will be a lack of global clarity and alignment, resulting in fragmented policies and systems.”

Revised Timeline for the Net-Zero Framework

Based on the decision reached during the MEPC/ES.2 session in October 2025, the NZF timeline has shifted as follows:

Reconsideration and Approval: The framework will now be reconsidered for formal adoption at the next Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) session scheduled for October 2026.

Earliest Entry-into-Force Date: Due to the procedural timelines under the IMO’s tacit-acceptance system, the earliest feasible entry-into-force date for the NZF is now 1 March 2028.

This delay reflects a strategic recalibration of the industry’s decarbonization trajectory and pushes back the timeline for introducing the NZF’s core economic mechanism.

Ongoing Regulatory Obligations

Despite the postponement of the NZF’s adoption, the following regulations and strategy remain in effect:

IMO 2023 Greenhouse Gas Strategy: The sector remains committed to the goal of achieving net-zero GHG emissions by or around 2050.

Existing Efficiency Regulations: Compliance remains mandatory for the in-force efficiency and data-reporting regulations, which form the technical foundation for the future NZF:

Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index (EEXI)

Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII)

Data Collection System (DCS)

Shipping companies must continue to maintain accurate fuel-consumption and emissions records, as this verified data will be critical for establishing credible baselines once the NZF’s pricing and compliance obligations are eventually introduced.

The threats were made last month, as the U.S. maneuvered to block a new effort to tax pollution at a meeting of the International Maritime Organization in London.

Eight envoys, officials and civil society observers from Europe, granted anonymity to describe the fractious closed-door discussions and protect their relationships with those involved, confirmed national delegates had reported they had been threatened with personal consequences if they went against Washington.

“Our negotiators had never seen this before in any international talks,” said one European official, who had spoken to negotiators. “People being summoned to the U.S. Embassy in London — intimidation, threats of cessation of business, threats of family members losing visas.”

Another European Commission official added that diplomats returned home rattled after the meetings: “We had feedback from a number of people involved in the negotiations about the pressure they faced.”

Since Donald Trump’s return to office, the administration has sought to undermine global climate policy and promote U.S. fossil fuel interests. The president has called efforts to combat global warming a “con job.” He was particularly enraged about the maritime emissions effort, saying it would hit American shippers with unwarranted taxes.

The International Maritime Organization is a U.N. agency that regulates the world’s shipping industry; measures taken there are enforced by its 176 member states — almost every nation on Earth with a coastline. The EU is not a member, but the European Commission and the vast majority of EU countries had been an early supporter of the carbon tax measure.

The U.S. strategy was laid out publicly ahead of the meeting, with a press release signed by the U.S. secretaries of state, transportation and energy. On top of threats of tariffs, port fees and visa restrictions on crews, the U.S. said it would also look at “sanctions on officials sponsoring activist-driven climate policies.”

Only two EU members broke from the bloc: major maritime countries Cyprus and Greece, with the latter claiming its choice had nothing to do with U.S. pressure.

“We had made up our minds way before the U.S. became involved in this and we had actually voiced our concerns,” Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, whose country has one of the world’s largest maritime industries, told POLITICO in an interview after Athens switched its vote and backed a postponement. “I want to be very clear … I did not speak to President Trump about this.”

The new normal

The deployment of personal threats in an international negotiation represents another departure by the Trump administration from diplomatic norms and signals further tension in relations between the U.S. and EU.

The threats were not limited to European delegations, according to officials and attendees briefed on the events in London.

“I’m directly aware of threats being made to EU countries, island states,” said one observer from a civil society group, who was briefed on the matter by a delegation.

Delegates exposed to the intimidation campaign were unwilling to speak on the record for fear the U.S. would make good on its ultimatums. The Financial Times first reported the personal threats to delegates.

In a close vote, the summit chose to delay the emissions tax for a year — a feat viewed by many as a near-death blow to the measure and a major victory for Trump. Dozens of countries from Africa, the Middle East, Latin America and Asia agreed to the delay.

Other officials who spoke to the delegates said they were astonished at how strongly the Americans were prepared to pressure delegations.

U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said he and Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins had personally called more than 20 countries to pressure them. A senior Western diplomat confirmed the U.S. threatened Caribbean countries with tariffs if they did not agree to postpone the shipping emissions decision.

During the week-long IMO meeting, the “process was ongoing,” said the observer. In at least one case U.S delegates approached another delegation on the floor of the plenary and issued a similar set of ultimatums. “There was quite a bit of upset among the delegates.”

At a coffee break during the meeting, Vanuatu Climate Minister Ralph Regenvanu told POLITICO that other island nations had been subjected to “relentless pressure” from the U.S.. “There’s bullshit going on,” he said.

Although tough tactics are nothing new in international talks, the bare-knuckle approach of the U.S. in London was seen as extraordinary.

“U.S. pressure created an atmosphere of fear, which in turn created chaos that ultimately led to the adoption to be delayed,” said Christiaan De Beukelaer, a senior lecturer in climate and maritime transport policies at the University of Melbourne, who was present at the talks in an observer capacity.","https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=630,fit=crop,quality=80,onerror=redirect/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/03/GettyImages-2240532434-scaled.jpg",N,,2025-11-03 02:56:07.679092

According to more than ten diplomats, industry observers, and government officials present at the International Maritime Organization (IMO) talks in London last month, US negotiators threatened personal and economic consequences to intimidate smaller nations into withdrawing support for the Net Zero Framework, a plan designed to impose a carbon emissions levy on shipping.

“Delegates were approached individually and warned that they and their families could face restrictions entering the United States if they acted against American interests,” one participant told the Financial Times. Another compared the pressure to “dealing with the Mob,” describing it as “bully-boy tactics” that left the usually technocratic, consensus-driven IMO in a state of shock.

The delegation reportedly targeted African nations and small Pacific and Caribbean island states, with US officials warning that countries could face additional tariffs, higher port fees, and visa restrictions if they backed the framework. The US contingent was led by a team of eight officials, according to those present.

President Donald Trump has publicly criticized the framework as a “global green new scam tax on shipping” and called for it to be blocked in social media posts. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio also indicated in a pre-meeting statement that the administration was “evaluating sanctions on officials sponsoring activist-driven climate policies that would burden American consumers.”

The framework, which had been provisionally agreed by a majority of countries in April, was expected to be formally adopted last month. However, its legal adoption has now been delayed for a year amid the US-led disruption.

Experts warn that such coercive tactics could have long-term consequences for US influence in global governance. Creon Butler, head of global economy at Chatham House, told the Financial Times that while the intimidation may work in the short term, “it increases the chances that non-US countries will conclude they cannot work with the US, making agreements independently among themselves which simply work around the US.”

Delegates from countries including Bangladesh, Japan, and Indonesia reported receiving formal diplomatic warnings — known as démarches — outlining potential retaliation if they supported the framework. “There was a combination of economic threats, which were reiterated on the floor, as well as very personal delegate-level threats, including threats to visas,” said one anonymous IMO participant.

Despite ongoing technical discussions, several delegates acknowledged that with Trump in the White House, the likelihood of the agreement coming into force remains slim. The episode has raised concerns about the US’s willingness to flout established diplomatic norms in international climate negotiations.

The Financial Times sources emphasized that the aggressive US approach marks a stark departure from standard multilateral diplomacy, signaling a potential erosion of trust in Washington’s commitment to global environmental agreements.",https://slguardian.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/photo_2025-01-10_21-06-24.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 02:56:20.689576

Korea-based integrated logistics company HMM on Thursday (23 October) said it has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with four subsidiaries of Hanwha Group and Korean Register(KR) to jointly develop a next-generation zero-carbon propulsion system for ships.

The subsidiaries involved are Hanwha Power Systems, Hanwha Ocean, Hanwha Aerospace, Hanwha Systems.

Under this collaboration, the partners aim to design an innovative propulsion system that generates thrust from ammonia-based gas turbines (GT) and electrical power from fuel cells — enabling a fully carbon-free operation.

The project will focus on developing systems applicable to container vessels and will also include concept design of hybrid propulsion combining fuel cells and battery technologies, economic feasibility studies, and the design of new vessel hull forms optimized for this solution.

The cooperation is expected to create a synergistic model that brings together HMM’s operational expertise in shipping, Hanwha Group’s technical capabilities, and KR’s framework for technical verification and classification.

This initiative aligns with HMM’s ‘Net-Zero’ target, which has been moved forward to 2045.

The company continues to deploy LNG dual-fuelled and methanol-powered containerships in response to tightening environmental regulations and customer demand for greener logistics.

These improvements translate into a threefold increase in range that can cover all anchorages within Singapore’s port limits. Fully charged in under two hours, the vessel ensures high uptime and reliability for daily operations. The Hydromover 2.0 also boasts 25% more cargo capacity and a 75% larger deck space, supporting greater cargo consolidation, efficiency, and flexibility in port operations.

The Hydromover 2.0 also represents a major step forward in Yinson GreenTech’s vision to combine electrification and digitalisation in maritime operations.

Beyond its zero-emission propulsion, the vessel fully integrates marinEV’s Marine Digital Platform, enabling real-time analytics, route optimisation, automated vessel management, and data-driven decision-making.

This powerful combination of clean energy and smart technology positions the Hydromover 2.0 as a catalyst for transforming traditional port operations into connected, efficient, and intelligent ecosystems – setting a new benchmark for sustainable maritime logistics in Singapore and globally. See Annex A for detailed specifications.

At the launch event, Yinson GreenTech signed its first bareboat charter agreements with Yacht International UAE, marking a significant milestone in the vessel’s entry into the maritime market.

Deliveries of the Hydromover 2.0 vessels to United Arab Emirates (UAE) are expected to be completed by mid-2026. Additionally, a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was executed between Yinson GreenTech, Yacht International UAE, and Wilhelmsen Port Services to grow the adoption of electric vessels in ports throughout the UAE.

Jan-Viggo Johansen, Managing Director of marinEV, said: “The all-new Hydromover 2.0 sets unprecedented standards for the modern maritime industry. At the same time, the signing of new agreements in the UAE marks a pivotal step forward for marinEV and Yinson GreenTech.

Together, these milestones demonstrate our ability to move beyond innovation and into real-world deployment – taking proven electric vessel technology, connected IoT systems, and integrated digital platforms from Singapore to new markets. They reinforce our commitment to transforming port operations through the combined power of electrification and digitalisation, and to shaping a smarter, cleaner, and more connected maritime future.”

Prakash Vakkayil Bhaskaran, Chief Executive Officer of Yacht International LLC, said: “The launch of the Hydromover 2.0 marks a defining moment for the UAE maritime sector and for Yacht International. As operator of a fleet of 15 offshore support vessels & now one of the first operators to deploy fully electric vessels in the region, we are proud to contribute directly to the UAE’s Net Zero 2050 vision and Green Mobility initiatives.”

The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Shanghai Green Shipping Corridor, the first partnership of its kind across the Pacific, reached a new milestone on Monday (20 October).

The LA-LB-SH Green Shipping Corridor (GSC), facilitated by C40 Cities, has successfully delivered on its phase 1 milestones, including the expansion of shore power infrastructure to meet 100% electrification serving container vessels, deploying reduced lifecycle carbon-capable vessels, and scaling sustainable fuel bunkering operations.

The corridor partners presented their second Annual Progress Report at the North Bund International Shipping Forum 2025 on 20 October.

The report highlighted the significant progress made by the Partnership since the launch of the GSC, specifically over the past year, and outlines the steps planned to achieve future milestones, including demonstrating the feasibility of deploying zero lifecycle carbon emission container ships by 2030.

In March 2025, partners gathered at the Port of Long Beach for the second in-person meeting, in which the corridor partners reaffirmed their consensus on the corridor goals, further detailed additional actions for addressing challenges, and launched a fourth working group to focus on Metrics and Evaluation.

Along with the other dedicated working groups – Energy Supply, Carriers, and Ports– the partners continue to make progress towards their respective missions:

Ports Working Group

Expanded shore power infrastructure to reach 100% capability in Shanghai, Los Angeles, and Long Beach, cutting emissions while ships are docked and improving air quality for local communities. The Los Angeles and Long Beach Ports completed the installation of shore power to meet earlier mandated State regulations.

Bunkered more than 47,000 metric tonnes (mt) of green methanol at the Port of Shanghai, and realised China’s first linkage for domestically produced green methanol. Ports of LA and Long Beach are preparing for a methanol pilot project.

Commissioned a Clean Fuels Study for POLA/POLB and prepared for a clean marine fuel pilot project.

Building on the successful completion of Phase One milestone targets, the partners will continue to tackle significant challenges in 2026 and beyond:

Addressing the future of clean marine fuels due to the shifting regulatory, permitting, and policy landscape, such as the IMO’s Net Zero Framework.

Addressing market uncertainty on clean marine fuel supply and demand.

Note: For a comprehensive overview of progress and future plans, read more in the Annual Progress Report.

The recently delivered Vertom Tula is a 7,280dwt diesel-electric multipurpose cargo vessel. The solar system represents a major technical milestone and a step forward for sustainable shipping. Wattlab has delivered and installed 44 Solar Flatracks that will provide power to onboard systems, reducing 20% of the hotel load.

Vertom operates a fleet of over 100 vessels, ranging from 1,500 to 12,000dwt.

After production and assembly in September in Wattlab’s new production facilities in Rotterdam, the 44 Solar Flatracks were installed onboard within a day in the Port of Harlingen.

Bo Salet, co-founder and CEO of Wattlab, explains that the Solar Flatracks can be installed in a minimum amount of time using container twist lock fittings: “For shipowners, time is money, so speed and ease of use are important. Furthermore, we know that ‘space is money’ too. Hence, should the panels need to be removed to make way for a special type of cargo, the crew can easily stack and store them all on the footprint of one 20ft container.”

“During the pilots, the test results showed that the Solar Flatrack system performs well in the tough coastal shipping environment,” says Thomas van Meerkerk, Business Development Manager at Vertom. “Based on the results of our own and TNO’s research in the past months, we consider Wattlab’s Solar Flatrack an effective option for reducing GHG and pollutant emissions. Of course, these things also depend on the conditions our vessels operate in, but it’s clear that the system can provide both a positive ROI and contribute to CO₂ reduction in shipping.”",https://images.marinelink.com/images/maritime/w800/source-wattlab-165091.jpg,N,,2025-11-02 20:56:08.129386

In the crosshairs is the bureaucracy that makes it much more complicated and costly to register a ship in Italy, compared to other EU countries.
""The International Ship Register and the tonnage tax (an advantage that allows maritime companies to have an optional flat-rate taxation regime for ships) are the fundamental pillar for being able to sail under the Italian flag and manage the fleet from Italy.

Registering an Italian ship, he adds, 'is hell.","The Italian flag is losing ships entered in the register at a rate of about 3% per year, for a long time now. Launching the alarm is Confitarma, through the mouth of its director general, Luca Sisto, who recalls, and goes into detail, what the association's president, Mario Zanetti, pointed out during the last public assembly in October. In the crosshairs is the bureaucracy that makes it much more complicated and costly to register a ship in Italy, compared to other EU countries.

""The International Ship Register and the tonnage tax (an advantage that allows maritime companies to have an optional flat-rate taxation regime for ships) are the fundamental pillar for being able to sail under the Italian flag and manage the fleet from Italy. They are necessary conditions to have a national maritime industry, but they are no longer sufficient conditions. Proof of this is that, even with the international register and the tonnage tax, the Italian fleet is decreasing by about 3% a year. Why? Confitarma has identified the answer: because we have a bureaucratic apparatus for registering ships in Italy that now costs 300-400 thousand euro more per ship compared to European flags and our competitors who have administrative regimes similar or equal to those we have, that is, register and tonnage.

In effetti, guardando le tabelle messe a punto dall’ufficio studi di Confitarma, negli ultimi 15 anni, si vede che la flotta tricolore nel 2010 era ancora in espansione: contava 1.664 unità (+6% sul 2009) pari a 17,3 milioni di tonnellate di stazza lorda (+10%). Già nel 2011, però, inizia il calo: le navi scendono a 1.619 (-3%) mentre il tonnellaggio sale ancora (+8%, a 18,7 milioni: quindi meno unità ma più grandi). La situazione si ripete nel 2012 con -2% di navi (a 1.581) e +2% di tonnellate (19,1 milioni). Ma dal 2013 inizia una discesa sia del numero assoluto di scafi (-1%, a 1.564), sia del tonnellaggio (-2%, a 18,6 milioni) che non si è più fermata. Nel 2024 (ultimo dato disponibile) le navi battenti bandiera italiana sono arrivate a 1.206 (l’anno prima erano 1.237) e la stazza lorda è calata 12,5 milioni di tonnellate (erano 12,7 milioni nel 2023). Dal 2010, insomma, sono uscite dalla flotta 458 unità.

To put a stop to this downfall, 'obviously,' says Sisto, 'we need to work on all those conditions of ship management, under the Italian flag or by a company based in Italy, that are no longer in line with the competition of European and international markets. We need a national pact to simplify. And I say simplify, not deregulate; because we want rules, but we want them to be identical to those that other countries have'.

Registering an Italian ship, he adds, 'is hell. For example, if you don't do it on a Thursday but it happens on a Friday and you have to put together the permits of four administrations, you risk keeping the ship in port for three days without a flag, something that does not happen in another maritime country because you solve everything with an e-mail with a pdf file. This happens in Malta, Madeira, and Cyprus. Not in Italy, if you're abroad you have to go to a consulate that issues a provisional passport. And if the consulate is closed or perhaps has to issue visas for tourists, it doesn't even give the captain an appointment and so the ship cannot fly the flag and cannot be registered in the flag registry. It's crazy stuff that doesn't exist anywhere else in the world.",https://i2.res.24o.it/images2010/S24/Documenti/2025/10/31/Immagini/Ritagli/istockphoto-1969734354-612x612-U28563870332Mnt-1440x752@IlSole24Ore-Web.jpg?r=1170x507,N,,2025-11-02 11:01:02.891407

Summary The maritime sector is at a crucial juncture due to new greenhouse gas regulations, including the pending IMO Net-Zero Framework (NZF) aimed at drastically reducing ship emissions. The NZF sets ambitious targets: a 20% reduction by 2030, a 70% reduction by 2040, and total decarbonization by 2050, using 2008 levels as the baseline. DNV’s Maritime Forecast to 2050 provides insights on the regulatory landscape and the transition to low-GHG fuels and technologies. Stakeholders, including shipowners, must explore low-GHG fuels and technologies, emphasizing the need for infrastructure for refueling and CO2 offloading. LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas) and methanol are gaining prominence, while ammonia and hydrogen are in trial phases. Nearly the same number of alternative-fuel ships is on order compared to those currently in service, indicating a shift in the fleet’s capabilities. The forecast predicts that alternative fuel consumption could approach 50 Mtoe by 2030, with LNG leading the way. A significant workforce training initiative is required, with an estimated 33,000 seafarers needing alternative fuel training in the next few years. Wind propulsion technologies are being integrated into the fleet with increasing interest and regulatory support. The article discusses barriers to low-GHG fuel adoption, including technology, demand, costs, and fuel availability. Enhanced Chain of Custody models can facilitate the verification and tracing of low-GHG fuel, which may support market growth. Maritime forecast models suggest the establishment of CO2 offloading infrastructure could match the impact of using low-GHG fuels, stressing the need for early engagement with CO2 storage projects.

Welcome back to the Pfluger Fly-By, a roundup of events and updates to keep you informed about everything I’m doing week by week to represent you in Congress.

It is incredibly disappointing that we are on day thirty-one of the Democrats’ reckless government shutdown, and that Senate Democrats have officially voted thirteen times to keep the government closed. This week, I was back in Washington, advocating against this reckless shutdown, which hit a month today. As a result of the Democrats’ refusal to reopen the government, federal employees did not receive paychecks today, and tomorrow, SNAP benefits run out for the millions of vulnerable Americans who rely on them. I am infuriated by this. Please see below for a list of resources available to individuals impacted by this shutdown.

SNAP Resources for Texas-11

3.5 million vulnerable Texans will, unfortunately, stop receiving SNAP benefits tomorrow because Democrats refuse to reopen the government. It pains me that many people who rely on these benefits will not receive the critical support they need. I voted to fund the government, including SNAP, to avoid this very situation. I am infuriated that Democrats continue to put their political agenda before the well-being of Americans in need. I urge Senate Democrats to do the right thing and stop holding the government hostage. In the meantime, please reach out to my office if you are negatively affected by this shutdown and need assistance.

The Modern-Day Democrat Party is Not the Party of JFK

As we officially reach one month of the Democrats’ government shutdown, I was back in Washington, D.C. this week to join Speaker Mike Johnson, Majority Leader Steve Scalise, Majority Whip Tom Emmer, GOP Conference Chairwoman Lisa McClain, and several of my Republican Study Committee colleagues for the daily House Leadership press conference on Capitol Hill.

During the press conference, I called out Democrats for using struggling American families as political leverage and pointed out how today’s Democrat Party has drifted far from the ideals and policies of John F. Kennedy, who once famously said, “Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country.” Today’s Democrats have turned that on its head, saying: “Ask not what you can do for your country, but WHO you can leverage for your radical agenda.”

I also stood up for our service members and military families, many of whom are being directly impacted by the shutdown. With Goodfellow Air Force Base in San Angelo and Fort Hood in Killeen, I am fighting to ensure our troops, their families, and federal workers are supported during this time.

House Republicans did our job weeks ago by voting to fund the government with a simple, clean, nonpartisan continuing resolution. It’s time for Democrats to do the right thing and end this senseless shutdown. Watch my full remarks from the press conference here or by clicking the image below.

Jack Smith’s Partisan ‘Arctic Frost’ Investigation

Jack Smith’s ‘Arctic Frost’ investigation into President Trump, Republican lawmakers, and conservative groups has turned out to be exactly what we expected: an unconstitutional political witch hunt. The weaponization of our nation’s top law enforcement agency to target political opponents is unacceptable, especially in the United States.

This is exactly why I joined my colleague Congressman Brecheen (OK-02) in calling on Attorney General Pam Bondi to launch a criminal investigation into Jack Smith and every single Biden-era DOJ bureaucrat who attempted to subvert the rule of law and violate the constitutional rights of the American people. I also share the serious concerns of many of my colleagues regarding Judge James Boasberg and fully support an investigation into his involvement. These individuals must be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law – and we will ensure this kind of blatant corruption never happens again.

RSC Podcast with Special Guests Speaker Johnson and Majority Leader Scalise

I had a fantastic time hosting the Republican Study Committee’s Podcast ‘Right to the Point’ featuring special guests House Speaker Mike Johnson (LA-04) and Majority Leader Steve Scalise (LA-01). In the episode, we pointed out the reality of who the modern-day Democrats are, as they openly admit to leveraging struggling Americans to appease the radical left flank of their party.

We also made predictions on who will win the College Football National Championship, guessing if it will be the Texas A&M Aggies or the LSU Tigers. Listen to the full episode on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, and Rumble here.

Trump Administration Biosimilar Announcement

The Trump Administration announced major plans this week to accelerate and lower the cost of biosimilar development. This is a major victory in the fight to lower prescription drug prices and expand access for all Americans. As Secretary Kennedy noted, ‘Parents are facing heartbreaking choices between paying for medication or putting food on their tables. This is not acceptable in the United States of America.’ I am proud to stand with the administration on this effort.

Last month, I introduced bipartisan, bicameral legislation that directly aligns with this announcement by automatically deeming all biosimilars as interchangeable upon FDA approval and eliminating the unnecessary switching studies that delay patient access. The administration has called on Congress to act, and I’m ready to deliver. We stand ready to get this done and ensure more Americans can access life-saving medications without facing financial burdens.

Odessa Chamber of Commerce in Washington

This week, I had the pleasure of attending the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation Citizen Awards in Washington, DC, where the Odessa Chamber of Commerce was a finalist in the Best Civic Engagement Program category. Even though they did not win the title, our office is incredibly proud of their entire team for this accomplishment and recognition. Texas-11 is the best place to live, work, and raise a family, and I am grateful to represent so many amazing people dedicated to serving their communities.

UNtaxed Act

Today, I introduced the UNtaxed Act alongside several of my colleagues on the Republican Study Committee to prevent the United Nations (UN) from ever implementing a global carbon tax. This comes in response to the fact that earlier this year, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) was scheduled to adopt a “net zero framework” for the international shipping industry. This is a de facto global carbon tax on emissions and could increase global shipping costs by 10% or more.

I am proud to lead this effort to ensure that the UN has no legal authority to impose taxes on American citizens or companies. I also penned an op-ed in the Washington Examiner making the case for the UNtaxed Act. Read it here or by clicking on the image below.

American Cattle Ranchers are the Backbone of Food Security

I remain fully committed to supporting American agriculture and the hard-working men and women who keep our food supply strong. This week, I met with leaders from the Texas Cattle Feeders Association, and I spoke with House Speaker Mike Johnson about the reports of potential beef imports from Argentina. My stance hasn’t changed: American cattle ranchers are the backbone of our food security and a cornerstone of our economy, and we must support them. They work tirelessly to provide the highest quality beef for American families. Today’s higher prices are a result of strong demand, not a shortage of supply, and importing foreign beef would only discourage U.S. ranchers from expanding their herds and investing in domestic production.

Bringing in beef from countries with checkered animal health records also risks the integrity of our domestic herds and undermines the gold-standard health and safety practices upheld by American producers.

Borup highlighted growing opportunities within the European Union's Emissions Trading Scheme, with players already selling carbon credits at over €300 per tonne to global buyers such as Microsoft.

While the IMO delay may appear as a hurdle, Borup suggested it could also be beneficial, stating, “It could be in our favour,” provided Quadrise can scale adoption quickly. He emphasised the importance of a level playing field for shipowners across jurisdictions.

Proactive: Peter, very good to speak with you. The International Maritime Organization's delayed adopting its net zero framework for another year. What's your reaction to that decision and what does it mean for the pace of shipping's decarbonisation?

Peter Borup: There's no doubt it is adding uncertainty to the path forward — not just the exact fuel that shipping will focus on in the future, but also the whole decision-making process. That being said, the three major alternatives for shipping fuel in the future have been methanol, ammonia, and people have also talked about nuclear — all three fuels that are not readily distributable now. They all come with a certain question mark. So it's not an imminent fix.

I think overall, it's a little bit hard to tell whether this is good or bad for a company like Quadrise. But the uncertainty suggests that shipowners need to find a way of taking agency themselves. There are a number of technologies out there that they can look to — everything from rotor sails to blowing bubbles along the hull, to changing the paint used on the hull — that can easily offer 7% or 8% fuel savings. Or they can use our products — the Quadrise family of MSAR and bioMSAR — which also offer significant reductions in emissions and cost savings.

For me, the thing is that we may not have the perfect fuel yet, but if you're combining some of these technologies, the effect is cumulative. You can actually go pretty far and save money at the same time. So there's more confusion now, yes, but I do think that shipowners can still do a lot themselves while regulators figure things out.

Proactive: I wanted to ask about your fuels, Peter, because with no global carbon pricing mechanism in place until at least 2027, how does that uncertainty affect the commercial rollout of cleaner fuels like MSAR and BioMSAR?

Peter Borup: It's hard to say. I think it's more of a sentiment shift, if anything, that could affect it. Fuels like MSAR and BioMSAR offer cost savings compared to regular fuels and reduce emissions. So from that perspective, they are on fairly safe ground. I don't think it should be affected much.

There are already operational regulations in place — the EU is probably the most well known. Traditionally, many of the fuels have been appealing mostly to liner companies, or ships on a regular service, where you can build up distribution. But some of the content in the EU rules — the EU Emissions Trading Scheme — actually offers a tertiary market to asset players, traders, and operators.

They would take positions in physical markets and freight derivatives, and now they can also participate in the ETS. There are already players selling credits on the biofuels they’re using, having saved CO2 emissions compared to regular operations — selling them at more than €300 per tonne to big players like Microsoft.

So that market is there, and that still means many of these technologies remain very attractive to a wider audience.

Proactive: Do you think the delay could actually play in your favour? Some in the industry worry it could slow investment in new fuels. Does that create more short-term opportunities for transitional solutions like yours?

Peter Borup: I'm not sure. It really depends on how the shipping world reacts. I don't see it as a risk. I don't think this is clearly bad for us. It could be in our favour. But it also depends on how quickly we can have the fuels adopted. That is probably more important. I'm aware there's a window here — I think it's fairly broad — but the earlier we have adoption, the more good we can do.

Proactive: Your sense from attending that IMO meeting — how important is regulatory clarity for your customers and partners when deciding whether to switch from conventional heavy fuel oil to your lower emission alternatives?

Peter Borup: I didn't actually participate in it, but I followed it closely. What's really important for our clients — shipowners — is that there is a level playing field. That's also why the EU introduced their rules. Initially, it wasn't necessarily because they wanted to regulate, but because there was an absence of global regulation through the IMO.

That's one of the biggest fears of shipowners — having to comply with different regulatory frameworks depending on where they are in the world, and knowing there may be competitors who don’t have to comply with stricter rules. That could be in the EU or somewhere else. So the need for a level playing field remains — and probably only the IMO can provide that.",https://cdn.proactiveinvestors.com/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJwYS1jZG4iLCJrZXkiOiJ1cGxvYWRcL05ld3NcL0ltYWdlXC8yMDI1XzEwXC8yMDIxLTExLTI2LTA4LTE0LTA2LWUxMmY0MDNkMDRiMjdhZjU1MGVmMzM2ODZlZjU0MmNiLmpwZyIsImVkaXRzIjp7InJlc2l6ZSI6eyJ3aWR0aCI6MTIwMCwiaGVpZ2h0Ijo2MzAsImZpdCI6ImNvdmVyIn19fQ==,N,,2025-11-01 13:00:11.534114

Hanwha Systems","Four Hanwha Group companies — Hanwha Power Systems, Hanwha Ocean, Hanwha Aerospace, and Hanwha Systems — signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with global integrated logistics and shipping company HMM and leading classification society Korean Register (KR) to jointly develop and demonstrate next-generation carbon-free ship propulsion systems.

The collaboration brings together the capabilities of companies from the maritime, shipbuilding, and clean technology sectors to accelerate the demonstration and commercialization of carbon-free ship solutions.

Under the collaboration, the partners will jointly conduct concept design for next-generation propulsion systems — including an integrated solution combining an ammonia-based gas turbine and fuel cells for 7,000–8,000 TEU-class container vessels, and a hybrid system combining fuel cell and battery technologies for 2,000 TEU-class feeder vessels — while evaluating their commercial feasibility and developing new vessel concepts optimized for these solutions.

“The integrated propulsion system that combines fuel cells and ammonia gas turbines will set a new standard for maritime decarbonization,” said Hyoung-seog Kim, Head of maritime solutions business division at Hanwha Power Systems. “We will continue to expand collaboration with shipowners, shipyards, and classification societies to apply our technology to actual vessels as soon as possible and advance toward commercial operations.”

“This collaboration represents a strategic partnership to respond to the global shift toward decarbonization,” added Min-kang Kim, Head of maritime office at HMM. “Through demonstration and commercialization, we will accelerate the transition to a future eco-friendly fleet.”

“This project is an exemplary cooperation model in which the shipping, shipbuilding, and classification sectors establish safety and regulatory standards together from the early research stage,” said Kyu-jin Yeon, Senior vice president of KR. “It will contribute to establishing an international eco-friendly certification system.”

The collaboration builds on Hanwha Power Systems’ recent Approval in Principle (AiP) from the American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) for the retrofit of 174K LNG carriers with ammonia gas turbine propulsion systems. The MOU is expected to further accelerate the commercialization of a fully carbon-free propulsion system combining fuel cells and ammonia gas turbines.

The MOU serves as a collaborative model that combines Hanwha Group’s technological strength, HMM’s expertise in vessel operation, and KR’s technical verification framework to create synergy across the shipbuilding and shipping industries. Each company will contribute according to its area of expertise. Hanwha Group will lead integrated propulsion development. HMM will support performance validation using operational data. KR will carry out early-stage risk and safety assessments, provide AiP consulting, review regulatory and certification requirements, and conduct economic analyses.

The collaboration aims to disseminate zero-carbon propulsion technologies that align with the International Maritime Organization (IMO)’s 2050 carbon neutrality goal. Hanwha Group, HMM, and KR plan to continue their partnership based on demonstration outcomes, working to expand zero-carbon propulsion solutions and strengthen the global competitiveness of the shipping and shipbuilding industries.

Rising dependence on fossil fuels due to increased power demand from artificial intelligence and to geopolitical tensions have led to 2050 net zero goals becoming unattainable, Wood Mackenzie said in its Energy Transition Outlook report.

The report comes ahead of the COP30 meeting in Brazil next month where countries are due to present updated national climate commitments and assess progress on renewable energy targets.

Demand for liquid hydrocarbons is expected to peak at 108 million barrels per day in 2032 with natural gas demand remaining resilient well into the 2040s, the report said.

In China, oil demand stood at 16 million bpd in 2025, but rising electric vehicle adoption could lead to demand falling by 35% by 2060, the report said. However, India, Southeast Asia and Africa remain key drivers of oil demand growth.

A Wood Mackenzie analysis suggests that limiting global warming to 2 degrees Celsius would require $4.3 trillion in annual investment between 2025-2060 – an increase of 30% from current levels – to reach net zero emissions by around 2060.

Energy sector investment would therefore need to grow from 2.5% of global GDP today to 3.35% within the next decade.

“Fossil fuels are no longer uncontested; they are being squeezed into narrower roles, but their decline is proving more gradual than expected,” the Wood Mackenzie report said.

Displacing fossil fuels with renewable power is a pillar of the energy transition that seeks to meet the Paris Agreement target to limit global temperature rises to 1.5 C (2.7 F) above preindustrial levels.",,N,,2025-11-01 04:59:54.713714
