New Mexico,K-12 Education,Source New Mexico,Education in New Mexico: top stories of 2025,"In 2025, New Mexico's K-12 education system faced dual policy crises as a court ordered the Public Education Department to develop a remedial plan for at-risk students in the Yazzie/Martinez equity lawsuit, while the Trump administration's ban on diversity, equity, and inclusion programs triggered federal funding delays and withholdings of $6.8 billion for K-12 programs statewide. Plaintiffs criticized the state's remedial plan as ""too vague"" and insufficient for Native American, low-income, English learner, and disabled students, pushing for structural partnerships with families and educators rather than symbolic consultation. The month-long federal government shutdown further threatened Head Start programs, exacerbating uncertainty for early education and K-12 continuity.

Ohio,Protests and Civil Unrest,Ohio Capital Journal,Organizers launch bid to overturn Ohio’s latest marijuana law changes,"Ohioans for Cannabis Choice is mounting a referendum effort against Ohio Senate Bill 56, which imposes new restrictions on hemp and marijuana products that could eliminate more than 6,000 small businesses and thousands of jobs. Opponents describe the legislation as ""government overreach"" and a ""slap in the face to voters,"" accusing politicians of being ""hell bent on re-criminalizing"" cannabis. With hemp farmers, dispensary workers, and industry employees facing economic devastation, the high-stakes policy conflict creates conditions that could escalate into organized protests or civil unrest.
