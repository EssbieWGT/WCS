Louisiana,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,Louisiana Illuminator,Her baby was in the NICU. She was in ICE detention.,"The Trump administration abandoned DHS policies restricting detention of postpartum immigrants, resulting in the detention of individuals like Nayra Guzmán just 15 days after giving birth while her newborn remained in NICU. Guzmán was held for 34 hours at the Broadview Processing Center without medical assessment, breast pump access, or adequate post-surgical care for her C-section recovery and Type 1 diabetes. Conditions at the facility have been described as overcrowded, unsanitary, and lacking basic medical necessities, with a judge calling them ""unnecessarily cruel."" In March, Congress allowed a requirement for DHS to report on detained pregnant, postpartum, and nursing individuals to lapse, reducing oversight. The administration is now expanding this enforcement model to other cities through Operation Midway Blitz, despite documented health risks to medically vulnerable immigrants and their U.S. citizen children.",https://lailluminator.com/2025/12/02/ice-nicu/

Vermont,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,VTDigger,Immigrant review plan following DC shooting raises concerns for Afghans in Vermont,"USCIS indefinitely halted processing of all immigration requests for Afghan nationals and announced plans to re-examine green cards from 19 ""high-risk countries"" following a shooting in Washington D.C., with a broader review of all refugees admitted from January 20, 2021, to February 20, 2025. Approximately 650 Afghans residing in Vermont—who work in manufacturing, healthcare, engineering, and small businesses—face potential re-examination under this policy shift. The Vermont Afghan Alliance and Refugee Office condemned the attack but warned the federal response unfairly targets an entire community, emphasizing refugees already undergo extensive vetting lasting months or years. Local advocates are coordinating with attorneys statewide to support Afghans through the review process and ensure community members feel safe and welcome. The policy raises concerns about collective punishment and could chill participation from nationals who supported U.S. missions and fled Taliban persecution.",https://vtdigger.org/2025/12/02/immigrant-review-plan-following-d-c-shooting-raises-concerns-for-afghans-in-vermont/

Virginia,Public Health,Virginia Mercury,Spanberger announces seasoned policy advisor as next health and human resources secretary,"Gov.-elect Spanberger appointed Marvin Figueroa, a former HHS deputy secretary, to lead Virginia's health and human resources agencies overseeing public health, Medicaid, and social services, facing immediate challenges from shifting federal health funding and new state responsibilities under recent congressional action. The administration must navigate changes to Medicaid eligibility and hospital funding mechanisms while addressing rising healthcare costs and access barriers. Spanberger's policy agenda includes creating a single state-contracted pharmacy benefit manager for Medicaid to improve accountability and lower costs, establishing a statewide hospital price transparency comparison tool, and boosting funding for free and charitable clinics to serve those losing insurance. Figueroa pledges to tackle these issues urgently, collaborating with the General Assembly and state agencies to strengthen healthcare systems.

National,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,Stateline,4 Republican states will help Homeland Security obtain driver’s license records,"Four Republican states (Florida, Indiana, Iowa, Ohio) have agreed through a federal settlement to help the Trump administration access state driver's license data via the National Law Enforcement Telecommunications System (Nlets) to identify alleged noncitizen voters, as part of a broader effort to expand the SAVE citizenship verification program for bulk scanning of voter records. The settlement requires DHS to continue developing SAVE, which critics argue creates a massive federal database that could be misused for surveillance or political targeting. Democratic officials from twelve states have submitted public comments opposing the changes, warning that combining driver's license, Social Security, and voter data degrades election security rather than enhances it. The agreement could influence other Republican-led states to provide similar data access through Nlets, which states control. The Justice Department has also sued six mostly Democratic states for refusing to turn over unredacted voter rolls, further escalating federal pressure on states to comply with the administration's voter eligibility verification demands.",https://stateline.org/2025/12/01/4-republican-states-will-help-homeland-security-obtain-drivers-license-records/
