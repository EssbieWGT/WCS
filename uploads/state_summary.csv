Wyoming,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,WyoFile,Cheyenne couple seeks support for family after barber taken into ICE custody,"ICE detained and deported Carlos Montes, a Nicaraguan barber in Cheyenne, following a Laramie County Sheriff's traffic stop, despite his employer's claim he had proper work authorization approved by Wyoming's Attorney General's office; the agency provided no information to his family for three weeks, illustrating systemic communication failures. Immigration attorney Elisabeth Trefonas confirmed removal orders can occur even when immigrants believe their documentation is valid, noting detainees are frequently transferred between facilities before accessing counsel. The Sheriff's Office confirmed deputies initiated the stop for an inoperable headlight and that ""ICE authorized deputies to take Montes into custody."" The case reflects the Trump administration's termination of Temporary Protected Status for Nicaraguans and increased deportation efforts, creating a climate of rapid detention with limited due process. Montes' employer and community have rallied support, highlighting the human and economic toll on families and small businesses when immigration enforcement operates with minimal transparency.",https://wyofile.com/cheyenne-couple-seeks-support-for-family-after-barber-taken-into-ice-custody/
Ohio,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,Ohio Capital Journal,"Amid ICE agent abuse arrests in Ohio, advocate says it ‘fails to police its own ranks’","An Ohio immigration advocate is demanding ICE explain its agent screening procedures after two Ohio-based agents were convicted or charged with abusing women, raising concerns that rapid agency expansion may be compromising vetting standards. One agent received a 12-year sentence for coercing sex from immigrant women under his supervision, while another was charged with domestic violence after police responded to his home 23 times in 18 months. The advocate questions whether ICE requires agents to report law enforcement scrutiny and criticizes the agency for failing to police its own ranks while targeting immigrants with minor or no criminal records. These incidents highlight significant policy gaps in oversight and accountability within federal immigration enforcement.",https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2025/12/18/amid-ice-agent-abuse-arrests-in-ohio-advocate-says-it-fails-to-police-its-own-ranks/
Rhode Island,State Budget,Rhode Island Current,RIPTA once again counts on Gov. McKee to fill its budget gap,"RIPTA’s $158.9 million FY2027 budget faces a nearly $14 million deficit, prompting submission to Gov. McKee and state lawmakers for gap funding. State intervention—including a 2-cent gas tax hike and increased Highway Maintenance Account share—previously reduced the deficit from $39.8 million. Board member Normand Benoit advocated for a “millionaires tax” on high earners to fill the remaining shortfall, a proposal with legislative support that failed last session. The budget assumes revenue from a fare increase, though advocates warn this could reduce ridership and offset revenue gains. The outcome hinges on state political dynamics, including skepticism about the Governor’s commitment and debate over taxation versus spending cuts.",https://rhodeislandcurrent.com/2025/12/17/ripta-once-again-counts-on-gov-mckee-to-fill-its-budget-gap/
Missouri,State Budget,Missouri Independent,Missouri faces budget crunch as capital gains tax cut hits harder than expected,"Missouri's capital gains tax cut will cost $500 million this year—far exceeding the $160 million estimate—pushing revenues down 2.1% to $13.15 billion and creating a $2.6 billion deficit against current spending of $15.7 billion. Governor Kehoe will tap the state's surplus to cushion the shortfall while pursuing income tax elimination, a move Democrats oppose, warning it will force cuts to Medicaid, education, and public safety net services.",https://missouriindependent.com/2025/12/18/missouri-faces-budget-crunch-as-capital-gains-tax-cut-hits-harder-than-expected/

Washington,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,Washington State Standard,Immigration arrests in WA surged in recent months,"ICE arrests in Washington surged to over 950 between July 29 and Oct. 15, bringing the total since Trump's inauguration to nearly 2,000—more than double last year's figure—while the share of detainees with criminal convictions dropped to 31% despite federal targeting claims. Senator Patty Murray and the ACLU condemned alleged abuses, including a detainee mauled by a police dog, as the crackdown intensified following Congress's $170 billion funding allocation for Trump's immigration agenda. Deportation flights from Boeing Field increased to 3-4 per week, raising overcrowding concerns at Tacoma's 1,575-bed detention center, which holds over 1,300 people. State inspectors remain barred from the facility despite a court ruling in their favor, amid ongoing allegations of medical neglect and mistreatment.

Colorado,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,Colorado Newsline,Judge orders bond hearing for detained immigration rights activist Jeanette Vizguerra,"A federal judge ordered ICE to provide a constitutionally adequate bond hearing by Christmas Eve for immigrant rights activist Jeanette Vizguerra, who has been detained in Aurora since March.

The ruling, which grants a stay while the case proceeds, stems from a lawsuit by 12 Democratic lawmakers challenging the Trump administration's restriction on oversight of immigration enforcement amid rising detention numbers.

Mississippi,K-12 Education,Mississippi Today,Auditor: Half of state education money should go toward raising teacher pay,"Mississippi State Auditor Shad White proposes allocating 50% of the state's K-12 budget to teacher salaries, which would fund at least an $8,000 raise for educators who currently rank 40th nationally in starting pay and third-lowest when adjusted for cost of living. The proposal comes after a 2022 pay raise was eroded by inflation and insurance premium increases, leaving teachers earning less than during the Great Recession when adjusted for inflation. House Speaker Jason White has indicated education will be the headline issue in the upcoming legislative session, though teacher pay increases may be entangled with controversial school choice measures in an omnibus bill. Teacher organizations report that low pay is driving thousands of vacancies across the state, resulting in larger class sizes and less individualized instruction. The auditor's office notes that assistant teachers also face substandard pay, compounding staffing challenges in Mississippi's public schools.",https://mississippitoday.org/2025/12/17/state-auditor-teacher-pay-raise/

Kennedy Jr.—and competing priorities have driven outbreaks in Texas (803 cases), South Carolina (142 cases with 168 people quarantined), and other states, while the agency's own social media communication about the disease has dropped significantly, and state health departments urge employer accommodations for quarantined workers.",https://stateline.org/2025/12/17/measles-cases-rise-amid-holiday-travel/
