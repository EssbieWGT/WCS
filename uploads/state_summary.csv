Alabama,State Budget,Alabama Reflector,Report: Alabama cut environmental funding in half over 14 years,"State environmental agency budgets have been deeply cut across multiple states from 2010-2024, with Mississippi reducing funding by 71%, South Dakota by 61%, Alabama by 49%, Texas by 33%, and Montana by 32%, leading to fewer inspections and weaker enforcement. These state-level cuts compound a 40% reduction in EPA funding over 15 years and the Trump administration's proposal to eliminate most EPA grants to states, undercutting state regulatory capacity. The budget reductions have created staffing crises, with 30% of Texas's environmental workforce having less than two years of experience and North Carolina facing 20% vacancy rates. In response, some states like North Carolina have increased permit fees to generate revenue, though this only partially offsets reduced budgets. The combined federal and state budget constraints prevent full implementation of environmental laws during a period of expanding fossil fuel, plastics, and petrochemical industries.",https://alabamareflector.com/2025/12/28/report-alabama-cut-environmental-funding-in-half-over-14-years/
