Missouri,K-12 Education,Missouri Independent,Cost of future Missouri school funding formula unclear as task force continues work,"Missouri's School Modernization Task Force is developing a new K-12 funding formula that would raise the state adequacy target from $7,145 to $11,504 per pupil while eliminating thresholds for high-needs student funding. Governor Mike Kehoe's executive order directs the task force to reduce costs despite his budget maintaining flat funding and rejecting a $190.6 million increase mandated by recent state law changes. The proposed formula shift to base calculations on the top 100 districts' spending—rather than all high-performing districts—aims to stabilize funding after a ""more rigorous"" accountability system reduced qualifying districts from a majority to just 22. The changes would extend funding to an additional 8,000 low-income students, 35,000 students with disabilities, and 2,400 English learners by removing current proportional thresholds. Task force members acknowledge budget constraints may require caps on increases, as teacher salary pressures contributed to a 10% jump in the adequacy target despite the proposed stabilization method.",https://missouriindependent.com/2026/01/27/cost-of-future-missouri-school-funding-formula-unclear-as-task-force-continues-work/

Alaska,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,Alaska Beacon,"‘Our government is out of control,’ Alaska legislator says, calling for end to state aid for ICE","Alaska lawmakers are sharply divided over immigration enforcement policy as Democratic legislators question the potential deployment of 1,500 Alaska-based 11th Airborne Division soldiers to Minneapolis to support ICE operations. Rep. Andrew Gray and Sen. Scott Kawasaki sent letters to military commanders and Alaska's congressional delegation asking whether troops would detain suspected undocumented immigrants and how such deployment fits the division's foreign defense mission. Gray challenged Gov. Mike Dunleavy's decision to provide National Guard administrative support for ICE in Alaska while denouncing federal officers' fatal shootings during enforcement actions. Republican Rep. Jamie Allard countered that military commanders are not obligated to answer legislative questions and supported the deployment, stating ""that's what we need to do.""

Maine,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,Maine Morning Star,Sec. of State Bellows: DOJ demand for Minnesota voter data shows ICE raids tied to elections,"The U.S. Department of Justice is demanding voter data and public assistance records from states like Minnesota and Maine as a condition for ending immigration enforcement operations, a tactic Secretary of State Shenna Bellows calls coercive and unconstitutional. Federal immigration agents recently shot and killed U.S. citizen Alex Jeffrey Pretti in Minneapolis, the second fatal shooting there during a weeks-long operation. In Maine, Homeland Security launched an immigration operation detaining lawful residents, prompting Bellows to twice reject DOJ data requests. The federal government is suing Maine for non-compliance, claiming it needs the data to assess voter list maintenance, while the state argues the requests violate privacy and First Amendment rights. Bellows, running for governor, vows Maine will not surrender voter rolls as ""ransom,"" joining other secretaries of state opposing federal use of voter records for citizenship probes.",https://mainemorningstar.com/2026/01/26/sec-of-state-bellows-doj-demand-for-minnesota-voter-data-shows-ice-raids-tied-to-elections/
