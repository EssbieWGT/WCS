Maryland,State Budget,Maryland Matters,Maryland may face more than $300 million in new SNAP costs due to high payment error,"Maryland faces a significant budget deficit that HR 1 will worsen by increasing annual SNAP administrative costs from $115 million to $172.5 million. The state may also pay an additional $240 million for benefits due to its 13.64% error rate.

Tennessee,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,Tennessee Lookout,"In Memphis, volunteers document Task Force arrests and provide aid to those left behind","The Memphis Safe Task Force, launched Sept. 15 by President Trump, deploys federal agencies (ICE, Border Patrol, U.S. Marshals), local law enforcement, and the Tennessee National Guard for immigration enforcement in Memphis's Hispanic neighborhoods, conducting over 3,100 arrests and 35,000+ traffic stops since October. The volunteer network Vecindarios 901 (V901) monitors these activities, receiving up to 140 daily calls from fearful residents and documenting tactics like chemical agents and forcible entries, while providing families with legal aid and support. Official transparency is limited: the city's dashboard excludes location and demographic data, and the National Guard's presence faces a legal challenge from Shelby County Democrats. Activists argue the task force operates as a de facto ICE operation disproportionately targeting Hispanic communities under the guise of public safety. The scale of enforcement and community mobilization underscores significant policy and civil rights implications at the intersection of federal immigration authority and local governance.",https://tennesseelookout.com/2025/12/03/in-memphis-volunteers-document-task-force-arrests-and-provide-aid-to-those-left-behind/
New Hampshire,K-12 Education,New Hampshire Bulletin,"As New Hampshire education freedom accounts double, percentage of low-income recipients drops","New Hampshire's Education Freedom Account program expanded under Senate Bill 295, doubling enrollment to 10,510 students and increasing state spending to $51.6 million, while the proportion of low-income participants dropped from 39% to 19%. The policy change removed income limits, resulting in 96.7% of recipients already attending private or homeschool, and only 3.3% leaving public schools. Republicans champion the program as cost-saving and responsive to demand, while Democrats argue it diverts funds from public schools without proportional tax relief. Per-pupil costs decreased from $5,265 to $4,911 as wealthier families joined, reducing differentiated aid spending.

Washington,State Budget,Washington State Standard,WA Gov. Bob Ferguson says he’s drafting a cuts-only budget,"Gov. Bob Ferguson will release a budget proposal this month that addresses a multi-billion dollar shortfall solely through spending cuts, not tax increases. He stated he will not sign any sales or property tax increases and vowed to veto them if they reach his desk. This approach conflicts with progressive Democrats pushing for new taxes on wealthy residents and large corporations. Ferguson argues that proposed tax measures cannot generate revenue quickly enough to solve immediate budget problems. His proposal will serve as a template for House and Senate budget writers during the 2026 legislative session that begins January 12.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/briefs/wa-gov-bob-ferguson-says-hes-drafting-a-cuts-only-budget/

Lawmakers and advocates warn that inflation will effectively cut funding, eroding recent gains in teacher pay rankings and healthcare provider stability amid 10-12% cost pressures.

Florida,State Budget,Florida Phoenix,Fears of cuts to fire departments and emergency services plague Florida property tax proposals,"Florida House Republicans have proposed constitutional amendments to slash property taxes while protecting school and law enforcement funding, which would leave fire and EMS services—reliant on property taxes for roughly 30% of their budgets—vulnerable to severe cuts. Opponents warn this creates a ""fiscal crisis by design"" without alternative revenue sources, while Republicans suggest fire departments could instead use Municipal Services Taxing Units funded by fees and assessments. The proposals reflect a political feud between Gov. DeSantis, who demanded property tax cuts but dismissed the plans as ""milquetoast,"" and House Speaker Danny Perez. The measures would fundamentally alter Florida's local government revenue structure and shift emergency service financing away from traditional property taxes. Roughly 60% of fire funding in some counties already comes from such alternative sources, indicating a potential statewide restructuring of municipal funding mechanisms.",https://floridaphoenix.com/2025/12/02/fears-of-cuts-to-fire-departments-and-emergency-services-plague-florida-property-tax-proposals/

This one-time cash infusion addresses a $9.2 million deficit exacerbated by budget impasse borrowing costs that affected over two dozen districts, highlighting equity concerns in the distribution process. The allocation reflects ongoing political negotiations between House Democrats and Senate Republicans over implementing a Commonwealth Court-mandated fix to Pennsylvania's unconstitutional school funding system, originally planned as a seven-year, $5.4 billion increase but extended to nine years.
