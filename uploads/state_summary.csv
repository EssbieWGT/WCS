Missouri,K-12 Education,Missouri Independent,Missouri schools could see new performance incentives under emerging proposal,"Missouri's School Modernization Task Force is developing a $50 million performance incentive program to reward districts for student achievement in early literacy, middle school math/language arts, and college/career readiness, with recommendations due to the full group in January under Gov. Mike Kehoe's executive order. A key policy debate centers on whether to provide larger bonuses when English-language learners, low-income students, and special education students hit targets—a proposal by state finance chief Kari Monsees to ensure equitable distribution that was questioned by Herzog Foundation's Chris Vas as potentially signaling some students are valued more than others. Economist Michael Podgursky warned that without weighted incentives, wealthier districts would disproportionately capture bonus funding, while the model is based on Tennessee's approach of doubling rewards for economically disadvantaged students. The framework follows Arizona's failed outcome-based program, which lawmakers eliminated in 2024 after funds flowed primarily to advantaged schools. The program would be funded through a separate state budget line item, with a committee to be formed to set precise achievement targets.",https://missouriindependent.com/2025/12/04/missouri-schools-could-see-new-performance-incentives-under-emerging-proposal/
