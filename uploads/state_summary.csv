Utah,K-12 Education,Utah News Dispatch,"Utah schools will get a record $134 million in 2026 trust lands money, a 20% bump","Utah public schools will receive a record $134 million distribution from trust land investments for the 2026-2027 school year, a 20% increase driven by strong financial performance and Amendment B—a 2024 constitutional amendment that raised the annual distribution cap from 4% to 5%. The amendment enabled an additional $16 million for schools this year, with funds allocated on a per-pupil basis to K-12 schools statewide for academic intervention, technology, class size reduction, and professional development. Local school community councils, comprised of parents, teachers, and principals, determine how to spend the allocations, subject to school board approval. The distribution reflects the success of Utah’s School and Institutional Trust System, which manages 3.3 million acres of state trust lands and has grown the Permanent State School Fund from $50 million in 1994 to $4.1 billion today. Four state agencies oversee the system, including the Trust Lands Administration, School LAND Trust program, Utah School & Institutional Trust Funds Office, and the Land Trusts Protection & Advocacy Office.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/2026/01/07/utah-schools-2026-trust-lands-money-increase/
