Vermont,State Budget,VTDigger,"Benjamin Brickner: Vermont’s cost crises are connected. Our solutions should be, too.","Vermont's state-level cost crises in healthcare, housing, and education are interconnected and collectively strain local budgets; Acts 55, 68, 73, and 181 address these issues separately but miss systemic fiscal impacts. Rising health insurance costs consume increasing portions of school budgets, housing unaffordability drives enrollment declines, and demographic shifts pressure municipal services. The author argues state lawmakers must break policy silos and consult local officials to craft holistic reforms that account for these cascading budgetary effects. Without systemic change, towns face inevitable service cuts and tax increases despite piecemeal state interventions. This approach requires documenting local cost impacts and connecting state policy decisions to their downstream budgetary consequences.",https://vtdigger.org/2026/01/06/benjamin-brickner-vermonts-cost-crises-are-connected-our-solutions-should-be-too/

California,State Budget,CalMatters,El panorama presupuestario de California es desalentador. Esto es lo que necesitas saber.,"Governor Newsom's January forecast of a $363 million surplus for fiscal 2025-26 reversed to a $12 billion deficit by May due to wildfire disaster costs, a $6 billion Medi-Cal spike, and stock market volatility from Trump's tariff policies; the enacted budget relied on state reserves, internal borrowing, and freezing Medi-Cal enrollment for undocumented immigrants to avoid deeper cuts. The Legislative Analyst's Office projects the deficit will reach nearly $18 billion in 2026, marking the fourth consecutive deficit year despite revenue growth, with a structural deficit potentially hitting $35 billion by 2027-28. California faces an additional $6 billion in spending next year, including $1.3 billion in higher Medi-Cal costs due to federal policy changes and potential losses of federal housing funds. While state Democrats largely blame the Trump administration, California's heavy dependence on volatile capital gains taxes from high-income earners creates inherent budget instability.
