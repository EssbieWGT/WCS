Ohio,State Budget,Ohio Capital Journal,Ohio lawmakers pass bill limiting NIL contracts after cramming in several last minute budget items,"Ohio lawmakers added several last-minute budget provisions to House Bill 184, including a $40 million transfer from the general revenue fund to a first responder PTSD fund, changes to nursing home payment formulas, and a shift to attendance-based funding for publicly funded child care. The additions were criticized by legislators from both parties as an eleventh-hour process that limited review of spending affecting hundreds of millions of tax dollars. State Sen. Jerry Cirino indicated these corrections may not be the final budget adjustments. The rushed process drew bipartisan condemnation, with multiple lawmakers voting against the bill despite supporting some individual provisions. The bill represents a significant budget correction measure that reallocates state funds across multiple programs.",https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2025/11/27/ohio-lawmakers-pass-bill-limiting-nil-contracts-after-cramming-in-several-last-minute-budget-items/
