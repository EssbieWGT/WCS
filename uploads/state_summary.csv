Kansas,Protests and Civil Unrest,Kansas Reflector,"At Statehouse human rights protest, Kansans brandish outrage at ICE killing and political cowardice","On January 14, 2026, civic organizations held a ""human needs are human rights"" rally at the Kansas Statehouse in Topeka, where demonstrators displayed signs sharply criticizing the Trump administration's deployment of ICE agents and condemning the death of Minneapolis mother Renee Good. Protest signs directly targeted Kansas legislators Moran, Marshall, and Estes, accusing them of complicity through silence while declaring that ""when injustice becomes law, resistance becomes duty."" The rally occurred amid ongoing ICE raids and followed earlier ""No Kings"" protests and a government shutdown that had already dented the administration's popularity. The article notes that despite the demonstrations, some Republican-leaning business leaders and a former GOP state senator have begun advocating for a more just and humane immigration approach, recognizing Kansas's economic dependence on immigrant labor.

Minnesota,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,Minnesota Reformer,Federal judge tells ICE to cool it,"A federal judge granted a preliminary injunction preventing DHS and ICE from retaliating against peaceful protesters observing immigration enforcement operations in Minnesota, prohibiting arrests, detentions, and use of nonlethal munitions against demonstrators.

The case arose during ""Operation Metro Surge,"" the federal deployment of 3,000 immigration officers targeting Minnesota's immigrant communities, and stemmed from a lawsuit filed after a protester was detained for five hours without charge while observing an ICE raid. This decision represents a significant limitation on federal immigration enforcement authority against civilian monitors in the state.",https://minnesotareformer.com/2026/01/16/federal-judge-tells-ice-to-cool-it/
