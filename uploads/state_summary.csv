Nebraska,State Budget,Nebraska Examiner,Nebraska Department of Economic Development cuts full-time staff by 22 people in two months,"Nebraska faces a projected $471 million budget shortfall for the 2026 legislative session, prompting Gov. Jim Pillen to pursue $500 million in cuts to the state's two-year budget through workforce reductions across multiple agencies, including the Department of Economic Development (which shed 22 positions) and the Department of Revenue (which laid off 11 agents despite a 15% increase in unpaid state taxes to $310 million), with the administration attributing the downsizing to pandemic-era program wind-downs while unions warn that increasing workloads on remaining staff will degrade public services.",https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2025/12/05/nebraska-department-of-economic-development-cuts-full-time-staff-by-22-people-in-two-months/
Nebraska,State Budget,Nebraska Examiner,Nebraskans are being sold bill of goods on UNL’s proposed cuts,"The University of Nebraska-Lincoln's proposal to eliminate four academic departments misleads state budget oversight by claiming $1.69 million in savings while actual analysis shows a net loss after accounting for $1.23 million in lost tuition and $450,000 in continuing costs. The elected Board of Regents—tasked with protecting fiscal integrity—is presented with flawed financial data that could expose the state to legal liabilities exceeding any projected savings. These budget cuts undermine Nebraska's academic competitiveness and workforce development, jeopardizing state economic interests and aspirations to rejoin the prestigious Association of American Universities. Financial self-deception at a taxpayer-funded institution risks requiring state intervention and erodes public trust in governance. The Board must reject the proposal to avoid strategic setbacks that would ultimately burden the state budget more than any illusory savings.",https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2025/12/05/nebraskans-are-being-sold-bill-of-goods-on-unls-proposed-cuts/
Missouri,Public Health,Missouri Independent,Why America Is losing the fight against preventable disease,"Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and allies are systematically weakening the nation's public health system through funding cuts, staffing reductions, and mass firings, leading to a resurgence of preventable diseases including measles (1,753 cases, 3 deaths), whooping cough (25,000 cases, 3 infant deaths), and influenza (280+ pediatric deaths). The CDC website now includes scientifically false statements, eroding decades of trust in the nation's premier health authority. RFK Jr. dismissed all 17 members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and excluded vaccine experts from key discussions. He appointed David Geier—who has a documented record of scientific misconduct—to investigate the debunked vaccine-autism link. These actions undermine evidence-based medicine, replace scientific expertise with misinformation, and systematically dismantle public health protections.",https://missouriindependent.com/2025/12/05/why-america-is-losing-the-fight-against-preventable-disease/

Wisconsin,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,Wisconsin Examiner,Wisconsin communities have been standing up to ICE. Now the state Supreme Court could do the same.,"The Wisconsin Supreme Court has accepted an ACLU case on behalf of Voces de la Frontera challenging law enforcement agencies' authority to detain people based solely on ICE administrative warrants, with attorneys stating hundreds are illegally held for days. The case aims to establish a statewide judicial warrant standard already implemented in Milwaukee County, requiring court-issued warrants for ICE collaboration. Several counties including Palmyra, Ozaukee, and Kenosha recently rejected 287g partnership agreements with ICE following public pressure and advocacy efforts. Advocates warn Milwaukee could face militarized immigration sweeps similar to those in neighboring Minnesota and Illinois. The dispute centers on whether local law enforcement should participate in federal civil immigration enforcement without judicial oversight, potentially violating constitutional rights.",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/2025/12/05/wisconsin-communities-have-been-standing-up-to-ice-now-the-state-supreme-court-could-do-the-same/

The enforcement has created significant concerns in New Orleans' hospitality sector, which relies heavily on immigrant workers, prompting some businesses like Taqueria Guerrero to temporarily close.
