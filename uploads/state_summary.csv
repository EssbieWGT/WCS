Minnesota,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,Minnesota Reformer,Feds: 14 people arrested during immigration raid on St. Paul company Bro-Tex,"Federal authorities arrested 14 individuals suspected of immigration violations during a November 18, 2025 worksite raid at Bro-Tex in St. Paul, including persons with prior domestic abuse charges and felony reentry suspicions, though families identified detained workers with no criminal history who had lived in the area for years. Federal agents from ICE, DEA, and FBI used chemical irritants and physical force against protesters attempting to block the operation. The raid drew sharp condemnation from Minnesota elected officials and the Immigrant Defense Network, which argued it destabilized families and neighborhoods rather than enhancing public safety.

Idaho,State Budget,Idaho Capital Sun,Idaho Medicaid contractor to cut critical services for people with severe mental illness,"Idaho faces a projected $58.3 million budget deficit for FY2026 despite ongoing cuts, as state revenues dwindle following $450 million in tax cuts approved by the Legislature and Governor Brad Little. The state constitution's balanced budget requirement has prompted the Department of Health and Welfare to implement 4% Medicaid provider rate cuts and direct managed care organizations to reduce spending. In response, Magellan of Idaho is terminating critical mental health services on December 1, including peer support specialists and mobile treatment teams for severe mental illness. These cuts are expected to shift costs to more expensive systems like jails and psychiatric hospitals. Mental health providers warn the reductions risk increased community violence and homelessness among the 400-500 affected patients.",https://idahocapitalsun.com/2025/11/21/idaho-medicaid-contractor-to-cut-critical-services-for-people-with-severe-mental-illness/

Maryland,K-12 Education,Maryland Matters,Baltimore County lawmakers file bill to give inspector general oversight of school system,"Baltimore County lawmakers introduced bipartisan legislation to grant the county's Office of Inspector General oversight authority over Baltimore County Public Schools, following a county council resolution sparked by public controversy over the school system's budget. The bills, sponsored by Sen. Carl Jackson (D) and Del. Ryan Nawrocki (R), aim to increase accountability and transparency for the school system, which accounts for roughly half of the county's annual budget. If enacted, the county council would decide whether to implement the oversight change, which might not take effect until 2027. County officials noted that the inspector general's office would likely need to double its six-person staff to handle investigations beyond audits for the expanded jurisdiction. The proposal mirrors independent oversight structures already in place for Montgomery and Prince George's County school systems and represents a second legislative attempt after a similar 2021 bill failed.",https://marylandmatters.org/briefs/baltimore-county-lawmakers-file-bill-to-give-inspector-general-oversight-of-school-system/
Kentucky,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,Kentucky Lantern,Republican introduces proposal to require Kentucky police agencies to have ICE agreements,"Kentucky Rep. TJ Roberts is proposing legislation for the 2026 session that would require all state and local police agencies to enter into 287(g) agreements with ICE, a program that has expanded 641% under the Trump administration and provides federal reimbursement for officer salaries. The bill would mandate that officers complete 40 hours of federally-funded online training to gain authority to investigate immigration status during encounters like traffic stops. Democratic lawmakers oppose the proposal, arguing it strips local control from jurisdictions and could lead to racial profiling and erode community trust. Currently, 22 Kentucky law enforcement agencies have active 287(g) agreements, all signed in 2025. Supporters claim the program provides vital federal resources and aligns state law enforcement with federal immigration priorities, while critics contend it will push immigrant communities further into the shadows.",https://kentuckylantern.com/2025/11/20/35638/
