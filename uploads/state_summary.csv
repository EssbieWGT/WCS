Rhode Island,State Budget,Rhode Island Current,"Roger Williams, Fatima buyer needs $18 million from the state, and they need it now.","The Centurion Foundation requested an $18 million taxpayer-funded bond reserve to close its purchase of two Rhode Island hospitals after missing a court deadline, while Governor McKee's fiscal 2027 budget proposal includes no funding for the hospitals. House Speaker Shekarchi and Senate President Lawson remain noncommittal on the request but pledge due diligence to stabilize the hospitals in the best interest of Rhode Islanders. If the state rejects the funding, the hospitals transfer to state ownership on January 30, requiring the state to assume all operating, payroll, and liability costs. The request follows $12 million in state funds already provided through an escrow account to keep the hospitals operational. Critics urge state leaders to follow Massachusetts' model of comprehensive hospital funding, while Attorney General Neronha suggests the situation may be pivoting in a different direction.",https://rhodeislandcurrent.com/2026/01/20/roger-williams-fatima-buyer-needs-18-million-from-the-state-and-they-need-it-now/
Florida,Public Health,Florida Phoenix,Vax manufacturers could get hauled into court under bill moving in the Senate,"Florida's SB 408 would allow lawsuits against vaccine manufacturers for advertised vaccines, aiming to rebuild public trust as childhood immunization rates dropped from 85% to 75% statewide. The bill exempts health care provider-patient discussions and hospital/clinic promotional materials from liability definitions. Bill sponsor Sen. Erin Grall argued manufacturer accountability would restore confidence, while Committee Chair Sen. Jennifer Bradley cited a ""rise of a lot of diseases"" as context for the debate. The proposal conflicts with federal vaccine injury compensation systems but addresses state-level public health concerns about declining vaccination and disease resurgence.

Vermont,State Budget,VTDigger,Gov. Phil Scott unveils $9.4 billion state budget proposal,"Gov. Phil Scott proposed a $9.4 billion state budget for FY 2027 (July 2026-June 2027), representing a 3% increase over the current year but with fewer new initiatives due to the expiration of federal Covid-19 relief funds. State economists lowered revenue estimates by $8 million for the current fiscal year, while the administration projects Vermont will lose hundreds of millions in federal Medicaid and human services funding, leaving the $70 million legislative reserve insufficient to cover gaps. The budget allocates $105 million to reduce statewide property tax increases from 12% to 5.5%, drawing $30 million from a 2025 tax relief reserve. It also redirects $10 million in vehicle purchase-and-use tax revenue from the Education Fund to the struggling Transportation Fund, which faces declining gas tax revenues. These funding shifts may require layoffs at the Agency of Transportation and signal a more constrained fiscal environment requiring heightened budget discipline.",https://vtdigger.org/2026/01/20/gov-phil-scott-unveils-9-4-billion-state-budget-proposal/

Democrats' focus on affordability and resistance to tax hikes constrain options, though progressives suggest new tax brackets for high earners and businesses.

State Superintendent Lindel Fields advocates for a ""marathon"" approach, prioritizing long-term investments in early literacy screenings, intervention specialists, and targeted at-risk student supports before implementing retention.
