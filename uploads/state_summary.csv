Wisconsin,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,Wisconsin Examiner,Another person in Minneapolis shot and killed by feds,"Federal immigration officers shot and killed a man in Minneapolis for the third time in three weeks, prompting Governor Tim Walz to condemn the shooting; the Department of Homeland Security claimed the man was armed, but the agency's prior statements about similar shootings have been contradicted by evidence—including a 911 call and surveillance footage—and later revised, and the incident occurred one day after tens of thousands protested ICE in downtown Minneapolis.",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/2026/01/24/another-person-in-minneapolis-shot-and-killed-by-feds/
California,Public Health,CalMatters,Feds drop effort to get trans patients’ records from LA children’s hospital,"The U.S. Department of Justice withdrew its subpoena for identifying records of transgender youth patients at Children's Hospital Los Angeles through 2029 after families sued to protect medical privacy from a fraud investigation that lacked evidence. The hospital had already closed its Center for Transyouth Health and Development serving approximately 3,000 patients last July under federal pressure from executive orders threatening funding for gender-affirming care. California Attorney General Rob Bonta opposed these federal actions through lawsuits and amicus briefs, highlighting the conflict between federal policy and state protections for healthcare access.",https://calmatters.org/health/2026/01/childrens-hospital-transgender-patients-california/

New Mexico,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,Source New Mexico,NM GOP senator asks feds to intervene and help stop immigration detention ban,"Republican Sen. James Townsend asked the DOJ to intervene against House Bill 9, which prohibits New Mexico public entities from contracting with ICE for immigrant detention, citing a Third Circuit ruling that struck down a similar New Jersey law.

Iowa,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,Iowa Capital Dispatch,Iowa ICE detainee’s attorney seeks sanctions against federal government,"An Iowa asylum seeker's attorney is asking a federal judge to hold the government in contempt for denying due process under the Trump administration's mandatory detention policy, which over 300 federal judges have rejected but DHS/DOJ continue to enforce. The dispute centers on a bond hearing ordered by a federal judge but conducted by an immigration judge who previously worked for ICE and denies asylum at a rate of 89.6% compared to the 58.9% national average. The Department of Justice opposes sanctions, arguing immigration judges are independent and complied with the order, while also defending the judge's finding that the detainee is a flight risk. The case reflects broader concerns about the administration's hiring of ""deportation judges"" and the influence of political considerations on an immigration court system where judges are executive branch employees, not independent judiciary.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/2026/01/23/iowa-ice-detainees-attorney-seeks-sanctions-against-federal-government/

North Dakota,Public Health,North Dakota Monitor,Rural hospitals called ‘not optional’ as North Dakota acts to keep one open,"The North Dakota Legislature passed SB 2403, authorizing the state-owned Bank of North Dakota to issue up to $5 million in low-interest emergency loans to financially distressed nonprofit rural hospitals, with Jacobson Memorial Hospital in Elgin being the sole current eligible institution. The bill aims to prevent closure of the facility that serves residents across Grant, Morton, Sioux, Hettinger, and Adams counties, who would otherwise face 45-minute or longer drives to the nearest medical facility. While the Senate approved the measure unanimously 46-0, House debate centered on the hospital's long-term solvency and constitutional concerns about state gifting, though it ultimately passed 80-12. The legislation reflects state policymakers' recognition that rural hospital closures create permanent public health infrastructure gaps, as reopening closed facilities is considered nearly impossible. The Bank of North Dakota will subject the hospital to rigorous financial scrutiny to assess sustainability before issuing the loan.",https://northdakotamonitor.com/2026/01/23/rural-hospitals-called-not-optional-as-north-dakota-acts-to-keep-one-open/
