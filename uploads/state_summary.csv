Idaho,State Budget,Idaho Capital Sun,Idaho’s projected budget deficit estimated at $40 million heading into 2026 legislative session,"Idaho's FY2026 budget deficit is projected at $40.3 million (down from $58.3 million), requiring constitutional compliance through likely additional cuts or tapping $1B+ reserves; FY2027 faces a $555.2 million shortfall after $4 billion in recent tax cuts. Democratic leaders advocate reversing tax cuts as a revenue solution, while Republican leaders downplay concerns but vow to balance. The legislature must decide whether to conform to Trump's tax changes, potentially costing $284 million. Lt. Gov. Bedke criticized the budgeting approach as ""Washington, D.C.-style.""

South Carolina,Protests and Civil Unrest,SC Daily Gazette,"Democrat running for SC governor argues arrest unlawful, accuses fellow Democrats of corruption","A gubernatorial candidate's disorderly conduct arrest relates to protest issues as the charge is commonly used against demonstrators; his lawyer argues the arrest was unlawful while he rehearsed political speech, alleging over a dozen police violations. The case raises First Amendment questions about protected political expression versus disorderly conduct. It prompts an internal affairs investigation into police response to public political activity. The incident highlights policy tensions between law enforcement authority and political speech rights.

Wisconsin,Public Health,Wisconsin Examiner,DHS reiterates recommendations that newborns get vaccinated for hepatitis B,"Wisconsin's Department of Health Services is reaffirming its recommendation that all newborns receive the hepatitis B vaccine within 24 hours of birth, directly contradicting a recent federal policy shift where the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices—now comprised of appointees selected by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.—eliminated the decades-old universal newborn vaccination recommendation. State health officials emphasize that infants have up to a 90% risk of developing chronic liver disease if infected, and that hepatitis B infections in children have declined 99% since the 1991 recommendation. The decision maintains Wisconsin's alignment with major medical organizations including the American Academy of Pediatrics and preserves vaccine access through the Vaccines for Children program and insurance coverage, despite the new federal guidance that suggests antibody testing before completing the vaccine series—a practice state health officials reject as lacking scientific evidence for newborns.",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/briefs/dhs-reiterates-recommendations-that-newborns-get-vaccinated-for-hepatitis-b/

Missouri,Public Health,Missouri Independent,Missouri doctors warn CDC vaccine change could put newborns at risk for Hepatitis B,"The CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practice recently reversed federal guidance to no longer recommend Hepatitis B vaccination at birth for infants of mothers who tested negative, prompting strong opposition from Missouri public health officials and medical experts who warn the change will increase infant infections and vaccine hesitancy. Missouri statute mandates prenatal Hepatitis B testing at the first appointment, yet 25% of pregnant Missourians delay care, and bipartisan legislation proposing a mandatory second test at 28 weeks has failed to pass for two years. Experts, including those from the St. Louis County Department of Public Health and the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, argue the new guidance overlooks postnatal transmission risks and undermines decades of successful perinatal prevention. The American Academy of Pediatrics continues to recommend universal birth vaccination, calling the CDC's move ""irresponsible and purposely misleading."" Public health leaders fear this federal policy shift will jeopardize vulnerable infants and reverse critical progress in eliminating perinatal Hepatitis B transmission.",https://missouriindependent.com/2025/12/12/missouri-doctors-warn-cdc-vaccine-change-newborns-risk-hepatitis-b/

The framework classifies schools as distinguished, on track, off track, or needing intensive support, with results validated by Old Dominion University to ensure transparency. 113 schools were conditionally accredited due to documentation issues rather than performance failures, and no schools were denied accreditation. The policy aims to provide timely, trustworthy data to target resources to struggling schools and improve student outcomes statewide.",https://virginiamercury.com/2025/12/12/most-va-schools-meeting-new-state-expectations-va-education-department-reports/
New Hampshire,Public Health,New Hampshire Bulletin,"COGE report recommends New Hampshire split apart health department, embrace AI","The COGE report proposes evaluating a split of the Department of Health and Human Services into smaller agencies to improve accountability for public health, mental health care, child protective services, and Medicaid/Medicare, arguing the department's size obscures performance and slows decision-making. The commission recommends this restructure reduce bureaucracy rather than increase it, enabling clearer goals and faster identification of inefficiencies. Additional health-related proposals include increasing fraud detection in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and implementing an automated verification system for Medicaid enrollment. The report suggests these changes could enhance oversight and streamline operations within the state's health and human services sector.

Alaska,State Budget,Alaska Beacon,"Disasters, dividends and deficit: Alaska governor unveils first-draft state budget","Governor Dunleavy's $7.75 billion FY2027 budget proposes drawing over $1.8 billion from the $3 billion Constitutional Budget Reserve to cover deficits driven by declining oil price forecasts, while allocating $2.4 billion for a $3,800-per-person Permanent Fund dividend. The plan cuts Medicaid funding, provides flat school funding with no maintenance allocation, increases Corrections spending by 3%, and refills the higher education and disaster response funds. Accessing the reserve requires a politically difficult three-quarters majority in both legislative chambers, where skeptical coalitions have historically opposed the governor's fiscal plans. A companion 10-year plan indicates billions in future tax increases will be necessary to avoid persistent deficits, acknowledging that depleting savings is unsustainable. Legislative leaders warn the fiscal situation will likely deteriorate further before lawmakers convene.",https://alaskabeacon.com/2025/12/11/disasters-dividends-and-deficit-alaska-governor-unveils-first-draft-state-budget/

Kansas,Public Health,Kansas Reflector,Small Kansas county to sue state for $2M meant for local hospital,"Morton County is suing Kansas for $2.15 million after a decade-long administrative error by the Department of Revenue misdirected voter-approved sales tax revenue meant for the local hospital, shorting it by over $1.8 million and forcing the county to incur debt to cover the facility's financial gap; the error persisted from 2015 until 2024, when the department corrected allocations following an attorney general's opinion, but county officials claim the state's rigid statutory policy constituted ""administrative voter nullification,"" demonstrating how state-level administrative failures can directly jeopardize local public health infrastructure despite clear voter intent.",https://kansasreflector.com/2025/12/11/small-kansas-county-to-sue-state-for-2m-meant-for-local-hospital/
Nebraska,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,Nebraska Examiner,Lawmakers invited to tour state-run ICE jail as group after Cavanaugh complaint,"Nebraska lawmakers' access to a state-run ICE detention facility in McCook has sparked a dispute after Democratic State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh was twice denied entry, prompting Republican State Sen. Myron Dorn to arrange a group tour for all 49 senators on December 15. The conflict centers on whether state law granting legislators access to state facilities applies to the jail now housing federal immigration detainees, with Gov. Jim Pillen's administration arguing the federal contract limits access. Cavanaugh contends the state contract with ICE cannot override state law, while Dorn and Legislative Executive Board Chair Ben Hansen say legislative access is questionable and may require legislation to clarify. The facility, which can hold up to 300 migrants awaiting deportation, resulted from Nebraska offering assistance to the Trump administration's immigration enforcement efforts. Media are excluded from the tour, and senators must complete federal clearance forms, highlighting tensions between state oversight authority and federal immigration operations.",https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2025/12/11/lawmakers-invited-to-tour-state-run-ice-jail-as-group-after-cavanaugh-complaint/

This government action transfers local district control to state authority under Texas education policy. Such interventions typically affect district funding allocation, curriculum implementation, and administrative leadership. The takeovers demonstrate the state's accountability framework for district performance and financial management.

Mississippi,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,Mississippi Today,Some local and state agencies are aiding ICE crackdown,"Mississippi law enforcement agencies are expanding cooperation with ICE through 287(g) agreements, with four sheriff's departments and two state offices (Attorney General and State Auditor) currently participating and the Department of Public Safety pursuing a task force model. These agreements enable local officers to identify immigration violators in jails, serve administrative warrants, and enforce civil immigration law on the streets. Additionally, Madison and Hancock counties have intergovernmental service agreements to serve as holding facilities for ICE detainees, reflecting a recent surge in federal immigration enforcement activity. State lawmakers have proposed legislation to fund these efforts and create a state immigration enforcement unit, though previous bills did not advance. The expansion aligns with the Trump administration's executive order to aggressively grow the 287(g) program, which has increased from 80 agreements in 2010 to over 1,200 nationwide.",https://mississippitoday.org/2025/12/11/local-and-state-agencies-are-aiding-ice-crackdown/
