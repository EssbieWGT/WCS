Louisiana,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,Louisiana Illuminator,"Louisiana, where parole is nearly impossible, is releasing prisoners to deport them","Louisiana implemented an expedited ""alien removal process"" through a special parole panel that grants parole to immigrant prisoners at a 100% rate for deportation purposes, bypassing strict eligibility requirements that apply to U.S. citizens; the policy, championed by Governor Jeff Landry and aligned with Trump's mass deportation agenda, has paroled at least nine men since August, transferring some to new ICE detention facilities like Camp 57 at Angola prison, while raising concerns about victim notification and a two-tiered justice system.",https://lailluminator.com/2025/11/24/louisiana-deport-parole/

New Jersey,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,New Jersey Monitor,NJ bill would ban ICE agents from wearing masks,"New Jersey lawmakers introduced a bill banning law enforcement from wearing masks during public interactions, targeting ICE agents conducting masked raids under the Trump administration; the legislation, supported by Governor-elect Mikie Sherrill, would impose $500-$1,000 fines and up to six months imprisonment for violations, though legal experts predict it would likely be struck down as unconstitutional state regulation of federal agents, mirroring California's similar statute now facing a Justice Department lawsuit.",https://newjerseymonitor.com/2025/11/24/new-jersey-bill-ice-agents-masks/
Tennessee,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,Tennessee Lookout,ICE’s latest focus in Tennessee: traffic court,"The Trump administration's January repeal of courthouse arrest restrictions enabled ICE to detain five people at a Robertson County traffic court after they pleaded guilty to driving-without-a-license misdemeanors; ICE Acting Director Todd Lyons' May memo explicitly endorsed courthouse operations, Wilson County's clerk routinely shares daily dockets with ICE, and Tennessee's classification of traffic violations as criminal rather than civil offenses facilitates these detentions by creating a criminal record that precedes immigration enforcement.",https://tennesseelookout.com/2025/11/24/ices-latest-focus-in-tennessee-traffic-court/
