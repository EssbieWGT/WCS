Federal data indicates over 70% of ICE detainees lack criminal records, while the administration has lost 350 of 362 federal court challenges to its fast-track deportation procedures.

Florida,State Budget,Florida Phoenix,"House Speaker Daniel Perez seeks cuts, restrictions, for safety-net programs","Florida House proposals HB 693 and HB 697 would cut state spending by restricting Medicaid and SNAP eligibility—including raising work requirements to age 64 and limiting immigrant access—while implementing prescription drug cost controls through a ""most favored nation"" pricing model to reduce Medicaid expenses. The bills would further reduce Medicaid costs by limiting retroactive eligibility for pregnant women and children from three months to two months, building on Florida's existing one-month adult limit. Speaker Daniel Perez framed the measures as protecting taxpayer dollars and implementing President Trump's ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" healthcare vision at the state level. However, the House has not released any legislative analysis or estimated fiscal impact for either bill despite their significant budgetary implications. The package also includes workforce provisions like repealing nursing home certificate-of-need requirements and expanding independent practice for advanced practice nurses, which could have secondary fiscal effects.",https://floridaphoenix.com/2025/12/09/house-speaker-daniel-perez-seeks-cuts-restrictions-for-safety-net-programs/

Josh Stein reversed them after successful lawsuits while warning the program will still run out of money before the fiscal year ends. Republican budget writers dispute the shortfall, arguing Medicaid had sufficient funds, and accuse Stein of manufacturing a crisis.

Missouri,K-12 Education,Missouri Independent,Massive tax break for Country Club Plaza would divert $188M from KC schools over 30 years,"The Country Club Plaza redevelopment's proposed $309 million tax incentive package would divert an estimated $188 million from Kansas City Public Schools (KCPS) over 30 years, costing the district approximately $6 million annually (61% of the Plaza's property tax revenue). The Port KC Board of Commissioners postponed a November vote after facing opposition from dozens of parents and community members concerned about public school funding. City Councilmember Wes Rogers, who sits on the Port KC board, stated he will only support the deal if it leaves KCPS better off, though the structure inherently reduces school revenue.

Vermont,Public Health,VTDigger,Parents and providers fear Rutland Regional Medical Center’s planned pediatric closure would jeopardize patient health and drive up costs,"The Green Mountain Care Board will decide by December 20 whether to exercise its new Act 68 authority to block Rutland Regional Medical Center’s closure of five pediatric inpatient beds, marking the first test of Vermont’s pioneering power to preserve hospital services. Parents and medical providers oppose the closure, arguing that emergency department observation is developmentally inappropriate for children and that transfers to distant academic medical centers in Burlington or Lebanon pose health risks, family burdens, and EMS resource strains. The hospital cites low patient volume—only 117 short-stay admissions this year—and projects $500,000 in savings, but critics challenge its cost analysis for omitting transfer expenses and higher academic center fees. Closure would eliminate embedded community pediatric care, forcing families to travel two-plus hours and potentially wait hours for ambulance assembly, destabilizing critically ill children. The board’s decision will set precedent for statewide health system transformation as Vermont balances fiscal constraints against rural access to specialized pediatric care.",https://vtdigger.org/2025/12/09/parents-and-providers-fear-rutland-regional-medical-centers-planned-pediatric-closure-would-jeopardize-patient-health-and-drive-up-costs/

Texas,K-12 Education,The Texas Tribune,Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick wants to increase the homestead exemption for school property taxes again,"Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick's ""Double Nickel"" proposal would increase Texas's school homestead exemption and lower the property tax freeze age to 55, directly impacting K-12 education funding by reducing local property tax revenue for school districts. The policy represents a state-level intervention in school finance that could shift funding burdens from local homeowners to potentially other revenue sources. The proposal was announced at the Texas Capitol on December 9, 2025, indicating a political priority for property tax relief tied to education funding mechanisms. This change would affect the fiscal capacity of school districts to fund teacher salaries, curriculum, and operations.
