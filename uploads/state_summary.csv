Utah,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,Utah News Dispatch,‘Stuck between a rock and a hard place’: Lawyers warn of arrests at Salt Lake immigration office,"Utah has seen a new ICE enforcement tactic beginning roughly two weeks ago, with immigration agents arresting individuals at USCIS appointments that were previously considered safe for processing green cards and other legal status applications. This shift follows a change in leadership at the Salt Lake City ICE field office, now overseen by a Border Patrol official. At least three detentions have occurred, including a 28-year-old father with an expunged juvenile record and a 54-year-old woman deported after 28 years in the U.S. The practice creates fear among immigrants and potentially undermines efforts to pursue legal status. Attorneys report that immigrants now face a dilemma: skipping appointments risks arrest, while attending them may lead to detention.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/2025/12/05/utah-lawyers-warn-of-arrests-at-salt-lake-immigration-office/
Mississippi,Public Health,Mississippi Today,Pediatricians in Mississippi to still recommend Hep B vaccine for newborns despite CDC advisers’ vote,"The CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices voted 8-3 to end its longstanding recommendation for universal hepatitis B vaccination of newborns, now advising the vaccine only for infants of mothers who test positive, a policy change that Mississippi pediatricians warn will disproportionately harm rural areas with inadequate prenatal care and delayed test results, potentially increasing infant acquisition of a virus that can cause liver cancer, cirrhosis, and death; national medical associations condemned the decision, while the committee's new composition under Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. reflects a broader shift toward parental autonomy that has already contributed to Mississippi dropping from first to third in childhood immunization rates after adding religious exemptions.",https://mississippitoday.org/2025/12/06/pediatricians-hep-b-vaccine/
Louisiana,Public Health,Louisiana Illuminator,"While scientists race to study spread of measles, Kennedy unravels hard-won gains","The U.S. risks losing its measles-free status due to ongoing outbreaks, with the West Texas outbreak costing an estimated $12.6 million. HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has undermined public health response by eroding vaccine trust, firing CDC advisory experts, and replacing scientific information with false claims. The Trump administration has downplayed the resurgence, impeded CDC communication with states, and slowed federal emergency funding. Public health officials are using genomic surveillance to track outbreaks but face challenges investigating cases in vaccine-hesitant communities. Louisiana Gov.
