DC,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Trump administration policy blocked that limited congressional visits to ICE facilities,"A federal judge temporarily blocked a DHS policy requiring seven days' advance notice for congressional visits to immigrant detention facilities, ruling it likely violates Section 527 of the 2019 appropriations law that permits unannounced oversight. The policy, enacted this year under the Trump administration, was challenged in July by twelve Democratic lawmakers who argued it exceeded DHS authority and impeded their oversight of ICE facilities during an aggressive immigration crackdown. Judge Jia Cobb found the notice requirement effectively prevents members of Congress from entering facilities, contrary to law. The decision preserves lawmakers' ability to conduct unannounced visits while the case proceeds, reinforcing congressional oversight authority. The provision originated from 2018 appropriations law after Democrats were denied access to facilities during the family separation crisis.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-administration-policy-blocked-limited-congressional-visits-ice-facilities

Non-compliant agencies could face state oversight or suspension of officer certifications.

Kentucky,K-12 Education,Kentucky Lantern,"KY Supreme Court changes course, strikes down law singling out Jefferson County schools","The Kentucky Supreme Court reversed a prior ruling and declared a 2022 law unconstitutional in a 4-3 decision; the law would have transferred authority from Jefferson County Public Schools' elected board to its appointed superintendent. The majority opinion deemed the law improper ""special legislation"" targeting a single district, while dissenters criticized the rehearing as politically motivated following the election of Justice Goodwine, who received support from teachers' unions and the governor. The ruling preserves the existing governance structure of Kentucky's largest school district and intensifies political debate over education policy and judicial impartiality.",https://kentuckylantern.com/2025/12/18/ky-supreme-court-changes-course-strikes-down-law-singling-out-jefferson-county-schools/

Mississippi,K-12 Education,Mississippi Today,Auditor: Half of state education money should go toward raising teacher pay,"Mississippi State Auditor Shad White proposes dedicating 50% of the state's K-12 budget to teacher salaries, which could fund an $8,000 raise per teacher, addressing Mississippi's ranking as third-lowest in the nation for educator pay when adjusted for cost of living. The proposal comes as teachers report needing second jobs to make ends meet, and thousands of teaching vacancies are impacting student learning through larger class sizes. House Speaker Jason White has indicated education will be the headline issue in the upcoming January legislative session, with leadership including Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann expressing interest in boosting teacher pay. However, teacher salary increases may be entangled in an omnibus bill containing controversial school choice measures that many public school teachers oppose. The auditor's report notes that even after the 2022 pay raise, inflation and health insurance premium increases have eroded teacher compensation, leaving educators paid less today than during the 2007-2009 Great Recession.",https://mississippitoday.org/2025/12/17/state-auditor-teacher-pay-raise/
Connecticut,State Budget,CT Mirror,"Should CT fund its own SNAP program? Lamont, budget chair disagree","Connecticut's state budget surpluses have averaged $1.8 billion (8-9% of the General Fund) since 2017, prompting proposals for a state-funded nutrition program to replace federal SNAP benefits for 36,000 at-risk residents. Gov. Lamont recommends $24.6 million in emergency food bank aid but opposes ongoing state supplementation of federal programs. The state previously operated a purely state-funded food stamp program from the late 1990s through 2018. This reflects a budget policy divide between leveraging surpluses for direct assistance versus emergency channels.

Commissioner Lori Weaver claims contracts were underutilized and no families will lose services, though programs cannot expand. Left-leaning advocacy groups condemn the cuts as prioritizing tax cuts over essential services, while Governor Ayotte defends the approach. Additional cuts will be required to meet the full $51 million target.

Missouri,State Budget,Missouri Independent,Missouri faces budget crunch as capital gains tax cut hits harder than expected,"Missouri's revenue forecast shows a $400 million shortfall for FY2025, with the capital gains tax cut costing $500 million this year—far exceeding the original $160 million estimate—creating a $2.6 billion gap between projected spending ($15.7B) and anticipated revenue ($13.15B). Governor Kehoe blames overspending while Democrats argue revenue insufficiency threatens safety nets and public services, highlighting a fundamental policy dispute over the state's fiscal challenge. Despite a historically large surplus that peaked at $8 billion, budget officials warn that three years of appropriations exceeding revenues is unsustainable and requires spending restraint. Kehoe plans to use surplus funds to address the deficit gradually over multiple years rather than through immediate drastic cuts. The governor has also made eliminating the state income tax—accounting for 65% of general revenue—his top 2026 priority, which Democrats warn would blow a $9 billion hole in the budget.",https://missouriindependent.com/2025/12/18/missouri-faces-budget-crunch-as-capital-gains-tax-cut-hits-harder-than-expected/
Wyoming,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,WyoFile,Cheyenne couple seeks support for family after barber taken into ICE custody,"Carlos Montes, a Nicaraguan barber with state-approved work authorization in Cheyenne, was detained by Laramie County Sheriff's deputies during a traffic stop and deported to Nicaragua on Dec. 4, reflecting increased ICE enforcement following the Trump administration's termination of Temporary Protected Status for Nicaraguans. His family faced systemic ICE communication barriers, receiving conflicting information as Montes was transferred between detention facilities in Colorado and Mississippi, a pattern immigration attorneys describe as typical under expanded deportation efforts that obstruct legal counsel access. The case raises policy questions about local law enforcement cooperation with ICE for minor violations, due process concerns when detainees sign documents without full understanding, and the human cost of separating a pregnant partner and child from their breadwinner. It demonstrates economic impacts on small businesses and community trust erosion when individuals with apparent legal work status are targeted. The incident underscores broader tensions between federal immigration enforcement priorities and state-level licensing systems that had approved Montes to work legally.",https://wyofile.com/cheyenne-couple-seeks-support-for-family-after-barber-taken-into-ice-custody/
Rhode Island,State Budget,Rhode Island Current,RIPTA once again counts on Gov. McKee to fill its budget gap,"The Rhode Island Public Transit Authority approved a $158.9 million fiscal 2027 budget with a $14 million deficit, an improvement from earlier $39.8 million projections after the state provided a $15 million infusion through a gas tax increase and boosted Highway Maintenance Account contributions. Governor Dan McKee and state lawmakers must address the remaining shortfall before July 2026, though McKee previously declined to fund a $32.6 million gap last year. The deficit reduction came despite sweeping service cuts across 46 of 67 routes, with the budget assuming fare increases will generate an additional $1.2 million. Board member Normand Benoit proposed funding the gap through a ""millionaires tax"" on high earners, a proposal supported by Senate leadership and Rhode Island AFL-CIO President Patrick Crowley that would raise the top marginal income tax rate from 5.99% to 8.99%. The political viability remains uncertain as Vice Chairman James Lombardi opposed tax increases, advocating instead for spending cuts elsewhere in the state budget.",https://rhodeislandcurrent.com/2025/12/17/ripta-once-again-counts-on-gov-mckee-to-fill-its-budget-gap/

State Epidemiologist Joshua Clayton urged potentially exposed individuals to monitor symptoms for 21 days and emphasized the importance of MMR vaccination, which is safe and highly effective. South Dakota's kindergarten measles vaccination rate has dropped from 97% to 90% over the past decade due to rising vaccine misinformation and increased religious exemptions. Thirteen of the 15 infected individuals this year were unvaccinated, demonstrating the direct public health consequences of declining immunization coverage.

Colorado,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,Colorado Newsline,Judge orders bond hearing for detained immigration rights activist Jeanette Vizguerra,"A federal judge ordered a bond hearing before Christmas Eve for immigrant rights activist Jeanette Vizguerra, detained in Aurora since March, requiring the government to prove she is a flight risk or danger to justify continued detention. Judge Nina Wang determined Vizguerra's detention is discretionary due to a 12-year-old removal order and found her prolonged detention raises constitutional concerns, resembles criminal incarceration, and requires due process. The judge also indicated that ICE may have targeted Vizguerra punitively for her First Amendment-protected activism rather than acting impartially. Vizguerra, who entered the U.S. without authorization in 1997, had a 2013 removal order she argues is deficient.
