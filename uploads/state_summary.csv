Missouri,State Budget,Missouri Independent,Mike Kehoe says Missouri is falling behind. His solution: more tax cuts,"Missouri's budget surplus is projected to collapse from $4.3 billion to $4.7 million next year, with Governor Kehoe proposing $600 million in core budget cuts and warning lawmakers against restoring reductions without funding sources. He simultaneously advocates for a five-year individual income tax phaseout, claiming past tax cuts delivered success despite Missouri lagging peers economically. To offset lost revenue, a constitutional amendment would allow expanding sales taxes to ""any goods and services"" while exempting these increases from voter approval and Hancock Amendment protections. The plan lacks the alternative revenue streams—such as oil and gas production or major tourism—that typically support income-tax-free states. Kehoe's approach escalates a two-decade Republican strategy of tax reduction while confronting the end of pandemic-era federal support and looming fiscal constraints.",https://missouriindependent.com/2026/01/20/mike-kehoe-says-missouri-is-falling-behind-his-solution-more-tax-cuts/
Missouri,State Budget,Missouri Independent,Proposals to expand Missouri private school voucher program meet tight budget,"Missouri's MOScholars program faces a budget crunch after spending nearly $40 million of its $50 million appropriation, with Gov. Kehoe proposing only $60 million for next year despite State Treasurer Malek's request for $100 million to double enrollment to 13,000 students. While Kehoe plans a $600 million cut to the overall state budget, lawmakers are considering expansion bills that would ""significantly increase"" costs by opening eligibility to current private school students, leaving no capacity for new applicants since most existing 6,000+ students return annually.",https://missouriindependent.com/2026/01/20/proposals-to-expand-missouri-school-voucher-program-meet-tight-budget/

Minnesota,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,Minnesota Reformer,"ICE terrorized a mall in St. Cloud, too","ICE's militarized operation at a St. Cloud Somali mall—using chemical irritants, brandished firearms, and baton attacks—resulted in three arrests and was condemned by state Sen. Aric Putnam and local officials, with St. Cloud police receiving no advance notice. The raid targeted a community that is 90% U.S. citizens, contributing $8 billion to Minnesota's economy and $67 million in annual taxes. Public opinion polls show 51-57% of Americans disapprove of ICE's forceful tactics, and 53% support criminal charges for the agent who fatally shot Renée Good. The incident raises serious constitutional concerns regarding collective punishment and violations of due process. The operation exemplifies escalating federal immigration enforcement actions that undermine local law enforcement coordination and community trust.",https://minnesotareformer.com/2026/01/20/ice-terrorized-a-mall-in-st-cloud-too/
Montana,Public Opinion Polls,Daily Montanan,Montana’s Say-Yes-Vote-No Senator,"The article frames a policy debate on passenger rail infrastructure that public opinion polls could measure regarding constituent support for transportation funding and senator approval ratings. It highlights a disconnect between political rhetoric and legislative action that surveys often track as a dimension of government performance. The piece implicitly claims to represent Montanan preferences on rail expansion, which polling could validate or refute. It questions political accountability on a major policy vote, a common subject of public opinion research. The controversy could generate polling on whether voters prioritize infrastructure investment and how they evaluate officials who contradict their stated positions.",https://dailymontanan.com/2026/01/20/montanas-say-yes-vote-no-senator/
Montana,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,Daily Montanan,"Downing backs Trump on Venezuela, ICE and healthcare, but remains committed to NATO","Rep. Troy Downing expressed strong support for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations, attributing domestic unrest over ICE raids to social media and biased news coverage rather than policy concerns. He defended federal law enforcement actions and characterized protester interference with ICE operations as a federal crime, while calling the shooting of a resident ""tragic."" Downing rejected claims of authoritarian overreach, stating that immigration enforcement is a long-standing bipartisan tool. He argued that social media amplifies anger and encourages protesters to cross legal lines by blocking federal agents from performing their duties. The Congressman maintained that the controversy is not partisan but stems from one-sided media narratives.",https://dailymontanan.com/2026/01/19/downing-backs-trump-on-venezuela-ice-and-healthcare-but-remains-committed-to-nato/

It’s going to take a marathon.,"Oklahoma legislators are considering the State Chamber's ""Oklahoma Competes"" plan, which emphasizes third-grade retention despite evidence that such policies may increase dropout rates and reduce adult earnings; the approach mirrors Mississippi's model, which saw short-term NAEP gains but no long-term improvement in eighth-grade reading scores since 2002, raising concerns about teaching to the test rather than genuine comprehension; while Mississippi's program launched with a $100 million private Barksdale Foundation grant, Oklahoma faces funding challenges due to ""penny-pinching lawmakers"" cutting support for education service providers; education advocates argue for prioritizing long-term investments in early literacy screenings, intervention specialists, extended instructional time, and summer programs before implementing retention policies; State Superintendent Lindel Fields advocates for a ""marathon"" approach of sustained investment in teachers and students rather than seeking a ""miracle"" quick fix.",https://oklahomavoice.com/2026/01/20/no-miracle-will-quickly-fix-oklahomas-education-system-its-going-to-take-a-marathon/
New Jersey,State Budget,New Jersey Monitor,State reserves will ease new governor’s budget decisions,"New Jersey enters 2025 with a near-record $6.7 billion surplus but faces a structural deficit exceeding $1.5 billion that will worsen as the Stay NJ program adds $900 million in annual costs and one-shot revenues expire. The fiscal gap threatens to accelerate when a $550 million debt fund transfer ends and potential federal Medicaid cuts could cost the state $3.6 billion annually. Despite progressive proposals for new tax brackets on high earners and businesses, legislative resistance to tax increases constrains revenue options, particularly since corporate taxes are already the nation's highest. Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill must deliver her first budget address in February/March amid political pressure to maintain affordability-focused spending that secured Democratic electoral victories. Republican lawmakers warn that without new revenue, the state faces difficult decisions about which services it can no longer afford.",https://newjerseymonitor.com/2026/01/20/state-reserves-will-ease-new-governors-budget-decisions/

Governor Brad Little is seeking additional Medicaid cuts while preserving expansion.

Idaho,State Budget,Idaho Capital Sun,Idaho Legislature’s budget committee adopts more optimistic revenue forecast,"Idaho's Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee unanimously adopted revenue projections of $5.665 billion for FY2026 and $5.816 billion for FY2027, exceeding Governor Brad Little's forecasts by $152.5 million and $137.4 million respectively. The higher targets reflect strong January revenue that transformed a projected $40 million deficit into a $106.2 million surplus. This fiscal cushion may reduce pressure for program cuts while enabling potential investments in wildfire suppression, infrastructure, tax cuts, or larger reserves. The early adoption on the eighth legislative day represents a procedural shift from prior years when revenue targets were set after major budget votes. Committee members unified behind the forecast despite differing partisan priorities, with Democrats emphasizing program preservation and Republicans focusing on tax relief and infrastructure spending.",https://idahocapitalsun.com/2026/01/19/idaho-legislatures-budget-committee-adopts-more-optimistic-revenue-forecast/

West Virginia,State Budget,West Virginia Watch,Morrisey’s budget proposal includes $13.5 million increase for SNAP in WV,"West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey requested a $13.5 million budget increase for FY 2027 to cover the state's new 75% share of SNAP administrative costs under federal law, representing an exception to his directive against replacing federal funds. The full-year cost totals $18 million, and the request comes as West Virginia's $21 billion proposed budget relies on federal funds for half its appropriations. State budget officials warned of an additional $28-84 million liability starting in 2028 if West Virginia fails to reduce its SNAP payment error rate below 6% as mandated by the same legislation. The Department of Human Services has implemented error-reduction measures, dropping the rate from 9.43% to 6.37%.

House Bill 4574 establishes a condition-based emergency funding program for financially distressed counties, while House Bill 4575 immediately allocates $8 million to Hancock County. The crisis stems from gross mismanagement, including employing 143 more positions than the state aid formula allows, a $5 million cash shortfall, and the former chief business officer disabling financial alert triggers in the state's Education Information System.

Rhode Island,Public Health,Rhode Island Current,"Transfer of Roger Williams, Fatima hospitals to state ownership set for Jan. 30","Two Rhode Island safety-net hospitals face an uncertain future after a prospective buyer missed a Jan. 15 purchase deadline, potentially forcing the state to assume operational and financial responsibility by Jan. 30. The facilities—Roger Williams Medical Center and Our Lady of Fatima Hospital—collectively manage 500 beds, 50,000 annual emergency room visits, and employ nearly 2,500 staff, serving as critical healthcare infrastructure. Governor Dan McKee's proposed fiscal 2027 budget did not allocate funds for the hospitals, despite Attorney General Peter Neronha confirming the state's potential obligation to cover payroll, taxes, and insurance costs. The state may pursue a court-appointed receivership to maintain operations, though officials have not publicly disclosed the potential cost of intervention.

North Dakota,Public Health,North Dakota Monitor,Rural hospital on the verge of shutting down could be saved by lawmaker’s bill,"Sen. Donald Schaible (R-Mott) has proposed emergency legislation creating a $10 million low-interest loan program for struggling nonprofit hospitals like Jacobson Memorial Hospital Care Center in Elgin, which faces imminent closure due to $3.8 million in debt and ongoing deficits. The program, administered by the state-owned Bank of North Dakota, would cap loans at $5 million per facility and require hospitals to demonstrate a viable business plan for returning to solvency. Hospital closure would eliminate over 100 jobs, the region's only ambulance service, and force residents to travel over an hour to the nearest medical facilities, while displacing 21 long-term patients. The bill requires approval from Legislative Management to be heard during the special session and could serve as a pilot program for other financially distressed rural hospitals across the state. Tim Blasl, president of the North Dakota Hospital Association, supports the measure as a structured solution that ensures repayment rather than a grant.",https://northdakotamonitor.com/2026/01/19/rural-hospital-on-the-verge-of-shutting-down-could-be-saved-by-lawmakers-bill/
