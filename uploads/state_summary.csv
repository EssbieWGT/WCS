Senate Democrats plan to block the bill, likely causing a partial government shutdown, while Ohio Republican Sens.

The partisan divide reflects broader national debates over immigration enforcement transparency, with Democrats seeking defunding as a check on executive power and Republicans framing opposition as supporting lawlessness.
