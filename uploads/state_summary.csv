California,State Budget,CalMatters,Newsom closed 4 prisons and trimmed payroll. Corrections spending is still over budget,"California's $17.5 billion prison system is exceeding its budget by approximately $850 million over three years, contributing to a projected $18 billion state deficit, despite a mandate for departments to cut operating expenses by up to 7.95% while corrections overspent by nearly 3%. The shortfall prompted a $357 million emergency allocation last year and occurs as the state faces a $12 billion general fund shortfall that forced cuts to health care and social services. Gov. Newsom's prison closures save about $150 million annually per facility, but the Legislative Analyst's Office warns that without dedicated funding reforms, prison budget deficits will persist and continue pressuring the general fund. Democratic Sen. Scott Wiener criticized the overspending as wasteful when funds could have served underserved communities, highlighting tension between corrections spending and broader state budget priorities. The administration declined to comment on the projections ahead of Newsom's January budget proposal, while advocates argue additional prison closures represent the only path to significantly reduce corrections spending and align it with state fiscal constraints.",https://calmatters.org/justice/2025/11/prisons-budget-overspending/
