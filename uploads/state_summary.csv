Maine,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,Maine Morning Star,Maine GOP lawmakers blame new state law for potential federal immigration operations,"Republican legislators blame Gov. Janet Mills for rumored increases in federal immigration operations, attributing it to her allowing a new law that will prohibit local authorities from assisting federal agents after the legislative session ends. State and local police cannot enforce immigration law but have contributed to arrests through traffic stops and 911 calls. Mills directed Maine State Police to support local agencies during federal operations while stating the federal government is unwelcome if it undermines civil rights. The Trump administration increased immigration enforcement funding and threatened to cut payments to sanctuary jurisdictions starting February 1. Lewiston and Portland mayors expect increased federal presence and urge residents to know their rights.",https://mainemorningstar.com/2026/01/15/maine-gop-lawmakers-blame-new-state-law-for-potential-federal-immigration-operations/

Kansas,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,Kansas Reflector,Kansas City-area Democrat attempts bill takeover to insert anti-ICE provision,"Democratic Rep. Susan Ruiz proposed amending House Bill 2204 to strip ICE of jurisdiction in Kansas, linking agent activity to decreased community participation and citing the fatal shooting of Renee Good in Minneapolis. Ruiz demanded ICE agents be unmasked, clearly identified, and required to wear body cameras. A rules committee ruled the amendment not germane, blocking the effort. The House passed Republican Rep. Rebecca Schmoe's original bill, which bars international organizations from exercising authority in Kansas, along party lines (85-35).

Wisconsin,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,Wisconsin Examiner,Wisconsin tribes react  after ICE detains Native Americans in Twin Cities,"ICE conducted a major enforcement campaign in the Twin Cities, detaining individuals—including at least five Native American citizens—based on appearance, resulting in one fatal shooting. In response, multiple Wisconsin tribes issued statements opposing ICE actions and affirming tribal sovereignty. Tribal governments are implementing protective policies such as issuing ID cards, advising members to carry multiple forms of identification, and providing guidance on legal rights during ICE encounters. The Ho-Chunk Nation is distributing door signs asserting citizenship status and requiring judicial warrants for entry. These actions highlight the conflict between federal immigration enforcement and tribal self-governance as Native citizens face wrongful detention.",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/2026/01/15/wisconsin-tribes-react-after-ice-detains-native-americans-in-twin-cities/
Wisconsin,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,Wisconsin Examiner,Immigration agents are using banned chokeholds that cut off breathing,"Immigration enforcement agents have used prohibited chokeholds and neck restraints in over 40 cases nationwide in the past year, violating DHS policies that ban such tactics unless deadly force is authorized, with no disclosed disciplinary action for masked officers. During President Trump's mass deportation campaign, these incidents have prompted states like California and Illinois to pass laws requiring agent identification and allowing civil lawsuits, which the administration immediately challenged in court. Former DHS officials and policing experts condemn the tactics as dangerous deviations from previous norms, citing risks of asphyxiation, brain damage, and death. The government does not track these incidents, creating an accountability vacuum where agents operate with impunity. The pattern represents a systemic shift toward more aggressive enforcement with diminished oversight and transparency.",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/2026/01/14/immigration-agents-are-using-banned-chokeholds-that-cut-off-breathing/
Wisconsin,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,Wisconsin Examiner,Kenosha sheriff opts to join ICE program,"Kenosha County Sheriff David Zoerner signed a 287(g) agreement with ICE in December, deputizing jail staff to enforce immigration laws against serious offenders in custody—a reversal from his prior skepticism about taxpayer benefits. Immigrant rights group Voces de la Frontera condemned the move as irresponsible and dangerous for a community still recovering from 2020's Jacob Blake protests and unrest. Zoerner, who serves on the National Sheriffs' Association Border Security Committee, defends the policy as deliberate public safety planning. Wisconsin now has 13 sheriff's offices participating in 287(g) programs. The decision emerges as a political flashpoint in the upcoming sheriff's race and has sparked plans for community protest.",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/briefs/kenosha-sheriff-opts-to-join-ice-program/

California,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,CalMatters,‘They’re escalating’: A Q&A with Rob Bonta on Trump’s immigration crackdown,"California Attorney General Rob Bonta secured a major legal victory over the Trump administration's immigration enforcement strategy when the administration withdrew its appeal of a federal court decision blocking indefinite federal control of the California National Guard, following a Supreme Court ruling on December 23 that halted similar deployments in Illinois and rejected the president's legal justification. Bonta, who filed an amicus brief in the Illinois case, stated this precedent prevents future unauthorized militarization of immigration enforcement. He emphasized California is preparing for potential escalated tactics like door-to-door raids, characterizing the administration's actions as political weaponization targeting blue states. The Supreme Court decision reinforced the Posse Comitatus Act's prohibition on using military forces for domestic law enforcement, requiring proof that regular military forces were insufficient—a standard Bonta argues the administration cannot meet.",https://calmatters.org/justice/2026/01/rob-bonta-national-guard-lawsuits/
