Missouri,K-12 Education,Missouri Independent,Public school open enrollment wins tentative support from Missouri education board,"The Missouri State Board of Education approved legislative priorities including ""voluntary public school open enrollment"" to secure a ""seat at the table"" in legislative negotiations, despite internal disagreement and concerns from members like Pamela Westbrooks-Hodge about potential harm to small communities.
