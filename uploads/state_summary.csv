West Virginia,State Budget,West Virginia Watch,"Morrisey asks WV agencies to cut their budgets, don’t ask state to replace lost federal funds","The Morrisey administration has directed West Virginia state agencies to cut budgets by 2% and not request additional state funding to offset anticipated federal funding losses, as the state—identified as the nation's most federally-dependent—faces up to $1 billion annually in reduced health care funding and $18 million in new SNAP administrative costs, while the Department of Education already experienced a $12 million federal cut; despite these pressures, the governor plans to propose 5-10% personal income tax cuts, arguing efficient management can deliver tax relief without sacrificing services.",https://westvirginiawatch.com/2026/01/12/morrisey-asks-wv-agencies-to-cut-their-budgets-dont-ask-state-to-replace-lost-federal-funds/
Michigan,Protests and Civil Unrest,Michigan Advance,"Gilchrist leaves Michigan gubernatorial hunt, announces secretary of state bid instead","Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist's pivot to run for Michigan Secretary of State focuses on protecting voting rights and election integrity. His campaign rhetoric references Michigan as ""ground zero in the battle for free and fair elections,"" alluding to past election-related protests. By addressing threats to democracy and a president ""who acts like a king,"" his candidacy relates to potential future civil unrest. The Secretary of State's office directly oversees elections, making it key to managing election-related demonstrations. Gilchrist's emphasis on preventing the ""crushing"" of public participation touches on issues that historically have sparked political unrest.",https://michiganadvance.com/2026/01/12/gilchrist-leaves-michigan-gubernatorial-hunt-announces-secretary-of-state-bid-instead/

Michigan's political leadership is polarized: Democrats condemn the shooting while Republicans, including President Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, defend the agent and label protesters as ""professional agitators"" and Good as a ""domestic terrorist.""

Kentucky,K-12 Education,Kentucky Lantern,Kentucky education commissioner will focus on school accountability in budget session,"House Bill 257 would overhaul Kentucky's K-12 accountability system to measure individual student growth rather than cohort performance, incorporate local community standards, and introduce adaptive testing to reduce assessment time.

The state supports phased universal Pre-K expansion through the governor's advisory committee. Meanwhile, Fayette and Jefferson County school districts face major budget deficits that may draw legislative scrutiny.

Detainees were sent to six Ohio facilities, with 137 held at Butler County Jail, which held 1,044 people—far exceeding its 844-person capacity and state-recommended 756 limit. Democratic state lawmakers wrote to the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Corrections demanding safe conditions, citing a ""fundamental failure to meet the state's duty of care."" Overcrowding and ongoing ICE operations have created community-wide fear, with families reportedly keeping children home from school and avoiding mandatory ICE check-ins.

Maryland,State Budget,Maryland Matters,"House Speaker Peña-Melnyk begins first session tackling budget deficit, immigration policy","Maryland House Speaker Joseline Peña-Melnyk must address a $1.5 billion state budget deficit in the 2026 session without raising taxes, requiring spending cuts and a freeze on new programs to meet the state's balanced budget mandate. The fiscal plan must also account for Maryland's loss of 25,000 federal jobs in 2025 and potential revenue impacts from the federal ""One, Big Beautiful Bill Act,"" which alters tax exemptions and cuts health care spending. The budget review process will prioritize maintaining existing programs while achieving fiscal balance.

Over half of those arrested had no criminal charges, while only one-third had criminal convictions. The administration has implemented stricter legal interpretations that attorneys say ""close off areas of relief"" and make cases more difficult to win. Immigration judges with pro-immigrant backgrounds have been replaced by military lawyers, and Attorney General Pam Bondi's decision to deny bond eligibility for those who entered without a visa—rejected by many federal courts—has created new legal challenges. The Justice Department defends these policies as ""restoring integrity to the immigration adjudication system"" and enforcing the law as written to protect American security.",https://marylandmatters.org/2026/01/11/more-than-3300-marylanders-were-detained-by-ice-in-2025-twice-the-number-of-preceding-years/
