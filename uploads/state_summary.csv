North Dakota,Public Health,North Dakota Monitor,Rural hospital on the verge of shutting down could be saved by lawmaker’s bill,"Sen. Donald Schaible (R-Mott) drafted a bill creating a $10 million emergency low-interest loan program for nonprofit hospitals to prevent closure of Jacobson Memorial Hospital Care Center in Elgin, which faces $3.8 million in debt and payroll-to-payroll operations.

Montana,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,Daily Montanan,"Downing backs Trump on Venezuela, ICE and healthcare, but remains committed to NATO","Rep. Troy Downing expressed support for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations, attributing domestic unrest over ICE raids to social media and biased news reporting. He described the shooting of resident Renee Good as ""tragic"" while asserting that protesters interfering with federal law enforcement put everyone at risk and commit a federal crime. Downing rejected claims of authoritarian overreach, characterizing immigration enforcement as a bipartisan tool used by presidents of both parties. He argued that media and social media are ""blowing it out of proportion"" and inciting people to cross the line from demonstration to criminal interference. The Congressman maintained that ICE enforcement is not a partisan issue but has become polarized because people are only getting ""one side of the story.""",https://dailymontanan.com/2026/01/19/downing-backs-trump-on-venezuela-ice-and-healthcare-but-remains-committed-to-nato/
