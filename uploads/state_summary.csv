New Mexico,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,Source New Mexico,Immigration in New Mexico: top stories of 2025,"ICE arrests in New Mexico surged from approximately 240 in 2024 to over 1,800 in the first 10 months of 2025 under Trump's mass deportation agenda, which included establishing a militarized ""National Defense Zone"" with new criminal charges and DHS painting the border wall black to deter climbers. The state's three ICE detention facilities faced heightened scrutiny as national custody numbers reached historic highs, while the New Mexico Legislature failed to pass the Immigrant Safety Act that would have prohibited public ICE detention contracts. In response, Attorney General Raúl Torrez joined multi-state lawsuits against Trump immigration policies, and the Legislature passed laws allowing immigrants to become police officers and prohibiting state employees from sharing immigration information with federal authorities. Cities including Las Cruces, Santa Fe, and Albuquerque maintained immigrant-friendly policies despite federal pressure, and the state allocated $12 million to replace federal food assistance funds cut by congressional action. The crackdown generated widespread fear across immigrant and Indigenous communities, with advocates reporting increased family homelessness and economic hardship due to prolonged detentions.",https://sourcenm.com/2025/12/29/immigration-top-stories-of-2025/
Missouri,State Budget,Missouri Independent,Missouri auditor warns of vanishing state general revenue surplus as spending rises,"Missouri Auditor Scott Fitzpatrick projects the state budget will hit a fiscal cliff by June 2028, depleting its surplus with a $370 million shortfall that could widen to $3.8 billion in a recession. Spending has exceeded revenues since fiscal 2023 due to rising education, healthcare, and payroll costs plus legislative earmarks. Revenue is declining 2.1% as capital gains tax cuts reduce collections by $500 million—far above the $110 million Republicans initially projected. Democrats blame GOP tax policies for creating the structural deficit, while Republican leaders acknowledge the need to limit spending. Gov. Kehoe's upcoming budget proposal is expected to include program cuts across all departments.",https://missouriindependent.com/2025/12/29/missouri-auditor-warns-of-vanishing-state-general-revenue-surplus-as-spending-rises/
California,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,CalMatters,Trump’s immigration crackdown upended life in California. It continues as the new year begins,"In 2025, the Trump administration targeted California first in its immigration crackdown, deploying National Guard troops and conducting raids that created a militarized enforcement model of warrantless stops and profiling, which the Supreme Court upheld and spread nationwide; the policies escalated federal-state conflict over sanctuary laws, detained long-term legal residents, destabilized schools and agriculture, shrank the immigrant population by 1.4 million, and set the stage for 2026's expanded interior enforcement, AI surveillance, and further legal battles.",https://calmatters.org/justice/2025/12/immigration-2025-year-in-review/
New Jersey,State Budget,New Jersey Monitor,New Jersey gas tax to increase 4.2 cents,"New Jersey's automatic 4.2 cent gas tax increase reflects a 2024 law signed by Gov. Murphy that raised transportation trust fund revenue targets to $2.1 billion this fiscal year (up from $2 billion), with projections to reach $2.4 billion by FY2028, directly affecting state budget allocations for infrastructure projects.",https://newjerseymonitor.com/briefs/new-jersey-gas-tax-increase/
Washington,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,Washington State Standard,"In Washington orchards, immigration crackdown sows fear and uncertainty","The Trump administration's immigration enforcement has shifted to targeting Washington farmworkers during commutes and shopping rather than workplace raids, intensifying fear among the estimated 40% of agricultural workers lacking legal status; Rep. Dan Newhouse's Farm Workforce Modernization Act, which would provide pathways to legal residency and mandate E-Verify, remains stalled in Congress, while the Labor Department proposes H-2A visa rule changes that would cut employer costs by $2.4 billion but face legal challenges from the United Farm Workers.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/2025/12/29/in-washington-orchards-immigration-crackdown-sows-fear-and-uncertainty/
Tennessee,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,Tennessee Lookout,"Afghans flee Taliban, find refuge and faith — and ICE — in Memphis","The Trump administration ordered ICE to detain Afghan nationals who entered after the 2021 U.S. withdrawal, halting all Afghan immigration processing after a November shooting incident and reversing Biden-era evacuation and Family Reunification policies. This has resulted in detention of Memphis families who legally entered via the CBP One app with I-94 documents and pending asylum hearings, demonstrating how policy shifts target refugees who followed legal procedures and prompting faith leaders to petition elected officials for intervention.",https://tennesseelookout.com/2025/12/29/afghans-flee-taliban-find-refuge-and-faith-and-ice-in-memphis/
Arkansas,Public Health,Arkansas Advocate,"Arkansas’ maternity ward shortage sometimes leads to births in ambulances, paramedics say","Arkansas's maternal public health crisis is intensifying as six maternity wards have closed since 2020, leaving only 33 hospitals with labor and delivery units across 22 counties and forcing paramedics to manage high-risk births in ""ambulance deserts"" affecting all 75 counties; Medicaid's inadequate reimbursement for over half of births and federal Rural Emergency Hospital policies incentivize further service reductions, while Delta Memorial Hospital's $2.1 million expansion represents a rare counter-investment.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/2025/12/29/arkansas-maternity-ward-shortage-sometimes-leads-to-births-in-ambulances-paramedics-say/
Colorado,Public Health,Colorado Newsline,Colorado needs transparency around asbestos contamination,"Colorado's asbestos crisis represents a public health policy failure, with 3,214 exposure-related deaths between 1999-2017 and no centralized registry to track contamination at military installations like Fort Carson; fragmented trust fund, VA, and CDC records block doctors and researchers from accessing exposure data, preventing effective disease surveillance, early diagnosis, and compensation for veterans, workers, and families affected by this preventable environmental health hazard.",https://coloradonewsline.com/2025/12/29/colorado-needs-transparency-around-asbestos/
Virginia,Public Health,Virginia Mercury,Virginia awaits decision on $1 billion rural health grant,"Virginia submitted a $1 billion ""VA Rural Vitality"" proposal to the federal Rural Health Transformation Fund to address rural health care access challenges and disparities through four initiatives: CareIQ ($282M for health technology modernization), Homegrown Health Heroes ($132M for workforce development), Connected Care, Closer to Home ($412M for telehealth and mobile clinics), and Live Well, Together ($124M for chronic disease management). The proposal comes as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act reconciliation package, which includes contentious Medicaid eligibility changes that could cause hundreds of thousands of Virginians to lose coverage and strain hospital finances. Republican members of Virginia's congressional delegation support the application, while health officials criticize the fund as a ""band-aid"" solution for broader health care funding challenges. If awarded, the funding would address provider shortages, outdated technology, and long travel times in the 60% of Virginia localities considered rural. CMS is expected to announce grant recipients by December 31.",https://virginiamercury.com/2025/12/29/virginia-awaits-decision-on-1-billion-rural-health-grant/
Maine,State Budget,Maine Morning Star,Budget pressures facing lawmakers in January — and how to address them,"Maine's December revenue forecast projects a $250 million surplus over two years, but federal policies including HR 1, tariffs, and deportations will shift tens of millions in costs to the state's general fund. Conforming to federal tax changes could cost Maine $300 million annually while federal cuts to assistance programs increase budget pressures. Lawmakers are considering progressive revenue bills—LD 1089 (income tax surcharge), LD 1879 (corporate tax increase), and LD 229 (bracket restructuring)—that would collectively raise over $400 million. These measures aim to fill gaps from federal policy changes and address prior underfunding of critical services. The article concludes that relying on the projected surplus alone is insufficient to meet these challenges.",https://mainemorningstar.com/2025/12/29/budget-pressures-facing-lawmakers-in-january-and-how-to-address-them/
Florida,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,Florida Phoenix,"Alligator Alcatraz, visa crackdown, mass detention: Year’s top immigration stories","Gov. Ron DeSantis signed SB-4C in February, establishing state-level immigration penalties, mandatory ICE partnerships, and ending in-state tuition for undocumented students. In April, a U.S. citizen was arrested and held for over 24 hours under the law despite presenting a birth certificate. Federal Judge Kathleen Williams held Attorney General James Uthmeier in contempt in June for defying her order blocking the law's enforcement.
