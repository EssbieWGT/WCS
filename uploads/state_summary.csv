Michigan,K-12 Education,Michigan Advance,"Vouchers, patriotism and prayer: The Trump Administration’s plan to remake public education","U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon is implementing a ""hard reset"" of K-12 public education by dismantling the Department of Education and redirecting taxpayer funds toward private, religious, charter, and homeschooling options. Her ultraconservative advisors advocate for infusing Christian values into public schools and promoting patriotic curricula that downplay slavery and discrimination. The administration has gutted the Office for Civil Rights, eliminating key enforcement mechanisms for protecting students with disabilities, students of color, and those facing sex discrimination. These changes represent a fundamental federal policy shift away from traditional public school systems toward expanded school choice and reduced civil rights oversight.",https://michiganadvance.com/2026/01/11/vouchers-patriotism-and-prayer-the-trump-administrations-plan-to-remake-public-education/

Kansas,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,Kansas Reflector,ICE agents shouldn’t troll courtrooms. A Kansas judge was right to object.,"ICE agents arrested a woman at Manhattan municipal courthouse after Judge Sarah Smith Barr objected to their presence during a hearing, prompting U.S. Attorney Ryan Kriegshauser to issue a warning letter accusing the judge of improper conduct and announcing an investigation into whether Manhattan is a ""sanctuary jurisdiction."" Kansas banned sanctuary cities statewide in 2022, and the Trump administration's Department of Homeland Security policy permits ICE enforcement at courthouses. The incident illustrates the conflict between local judicial independence and federal immigration enforcement authority. The presence of ICE in courthouses may deter undocumented individuals from reporting crimes or participating in legal proceedings. Kriegshauser's letter stated that his office ""will take all necessary steps to enforce federal law as needed,"" emphasizing the federal government's position on immigration enforcement in local courts.",https://kansasreflector.com/2026/01/11/ice-agents-shouldnt-troll-courtrooms-a-kansas-judge-was-right-to-object/
