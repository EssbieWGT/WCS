DC,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Federal judge blocks sweeping immigration arrests in D.C. without warrants,"A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction barring federal agents from conducting warrantless arrests in DC unless they can demonstrate probable cause and flight risk, following a lawsuit by immigration advocates alleging Latino residents were being targeted despite legal status. The ruling stems from President Trump's emergency declaration that flooded the capital with federal law enforcement and National Guard troops, leading to aggressive immigration enforcement. Judge Beryl A. Howell criticized the Trump administration's focus on arrest quotas over targeted enforcement, stating that legally, viewing all immigrants as criminals is wrong. The injunction represents a significant policy check on federal immigration enforcement authority within the District. Legal organizations including the ACLU praised the decision as affirming that all DC residents have rights regardless of immigration status.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/federal-judge-blocks-sweeping-immigration-arrests-dc-without-warrants

Florida,State Budget,Florida Phoenix,DeSantis administration: We need another $50M to cover SNAP costs,"The Florida Department of Children and Families is requesting $50.6 million in additional state funding for fiscal year 2026-27 to cover increased SNAP administrative costs mandated by the federal ""One Big Beautiful Bill,"" which shifts the state-federal cost share from 50/50 to 75/25 effective October 1, 2026. This new recurring expenditure would fund employee salaries ($34.7 million) and contracted services ($9 million), representing a significant budgetary pressure. The agency's request precedes Governor DeSantis's upcoming budget proposal, potentially shaping state spending priorities. Furthermore, Florida faces a potential $1 billion penalty in 2027 if its current 15% SNAP error rate is not reduced below the 6% threshold set by the same federal legislation. The combined immediate and future costs underscore a substantial fiscal challenge requiring legislative action to maintain program performance and support for 2.7 million Floridian recipients.",https://floridaphoenix.com/2025/12/03/desantis-administration-we-need-another-50m-to-cover-snap-costs/
