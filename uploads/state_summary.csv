Kentucky,Public Health,Kentucky Lantern,"Whooping cough makes a comeback, but the vaccine provides powerful protection","Kentucky's whooping cough outbreak, the state's largest since 2012, has killed three unvaccinated infants in 12 months, with vaccination rates dropping from 95% to 92% among kindergartners. The Kentucky Department of Public Health attributes the surge to declining immunization coverage, anti-vaccine sentiment, and service cuts. Public health policy recommends Tdap vaccination for pregnant women at 27-36 weeks to protect newborns too young for vaccination. Routine childhood immunization requires five doses starting at 2 months, plus adolescent and adult boosters. The resurgence correlates with a 1990s vaccine formulation change from whole-cell to partial-cell, reducing immunity duration from 10-12 years to 3-5 years.",https://kentuckylantern.com/2025/11/29/whooping-cough-makes-a-comeback-but-the-vaccine-provides-powerful-protection/
Maryland,Public Health,Maryland Matters,"Ahead of ‘difficult’ flu season, health advocates urge vaccinations for holiday gatherings","Maryland faces a challenging 2025 respiratory illness season as the influenza subclade K variant, which is less sensitive to the current vaccine, drives increasing cases amid declining vaccination rates and rising vaccine hesitancy. Federal health agencies have contributed to public confusion and skepticism through controversial messaging, such as the CDC's recent update bringing the vaccine-autism debate to the forefront. In response, Governor Wes Moore announced a state program to provide free vaccines to uninsured and underinsured residents in several counties, expanding access to counter cost barriers and federal policy undermining public health. State data confirms the trend, with peak weekly flu vaccinations dropping from 186,868 last year to 170,666 this October. Public health experts emphasize it remains critical for Marylanders to get vaccinated, as the vaccine still offers protection and cases are expected to peak in the coming weeks.",https://marylandmatters.org/2025/11/28/ahead-of-difficult-flu-season-health-advocates-urge-vaccinations-for-holiday-gatherings/
Vermont,Public Health,VTDigger,Vermont bids for new federal money to boost rural health system,"Vermont is seeking a federal rural health grant of at least $500 million to strengthen its rural healthcare workforce, shift services from hospitals to community settings, and address disparities including chronic disease, opioid deaths, and suicide; the plan implements Act 167 to stabilize financially strained hospitals, though officials acknowledge this one-time funding cannot fully offset other federal Medicaid losses from budget reconciliation.",https://vtdigger.org/2025/11/28/vermont-bids-for-new-federal-money-to-boost-rural-health-system/
Mississippi,K-12 Education,Mississippi Today,Oxford superintendent proposes ‘better kind’ of school choice from cradle to career,"Mississippi's Oxford School District superintendent proposes state policy alternatives to school choice, calling for universal early childhood education for 3- and 4-year-olds to close achievement gaps and improve workforce readiness. The second major proposal advocates for three flexible, equally-valued career pathways connecting high school to postsecondary: college-ready, applied-learning with paid apprenticeships, and direct-to-career tracks in high-wage industries. These pathways would require coordinated state investment and partnership between K-12 districts, community colleges, universities, and employers to ensure students gain both knowledge and experience. The plan emphasizes collaboration over competition, allowing students to shift between pathways while building capacity within public schools rather than diverting resources. By focusing on early intervention and multiple postsecondary routes, the approach aims to increase labor-force participation, retain homegrown talent, and strengthen Mississippi's economy without dismantling the public education system.",https://mississippitoday.org/2025/11/28/oxford-superintendent-school-choice-cradle-to-career/
