Colorado,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,Colorado Newsline,Hudson prison under contract to become Colorado’s newest ICE detention center,"The Trump administration's ICE contracted GEO Group to operate the dormant Hudson Correctional Facility as an immigrant detention center for at least six months, according to ACLU-obtained documents released Thursday. This represents part of a broader plan to triple ICE detention capacity in Colorado by adding 2,560 beds across three facilities, including Hudson. Contract details remain heavily redacted, prompting ACLU demands for transparency in how ICE plans to spend hundreds of millions in congressional funding allocated for immigration detention. The expansion follows $45 billion in appropriations to support Trump's pledged ""largest domestic deportation operation in American history."" Colorado currently operates only one other ICE detention center, also managed by GEO Group in Aurora, despite a previous $39 million contract for Hudson that failed to activate the facility.",https://coloradonewsline.com/briefs/hudson-colorado-ice-detention-center/
Arkansas,State Budget,Arkansas Advocate,Arkansas finance official says state won’t pay corrections board legal fees,"The Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration denied a $300,000 payment to the Board of Corrections' attorney, stating the Department of Corrections lacks appropriated funds and the expenditure violates state procurement law and constitutional requirements.

Arkansas,Public Health,Arkansas Advocate,"Hospital in South Arkansas closes maternity ward, adding to region’s shortage","The closure of Ouachita County Medical Center's labor and delivery unit—Arkansas's seventh since 2020—highlights a rural public health crisis, with paramedics reporting increased ambulance births and state Senator Matt Stone warning the closure will worsen the state's already-high maternal and infant mortality rates. Hospital administrators cited financial unsustainability, as the unit delivered only 119 babies last year against a 200-birth viability threshold, with inadequate reimbursement rates that the Arkansas Hospital Association confirms fail to keep pace with care costs. The hospital's application for federal Rural Emergency Hospital status, trading inpatient capacity for enhanced federal funding, demonstrates systemic policy challenges in maintaining rural obstetric care.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/2026/01/09/hospital-in-south-arkansas-closes-maternity-ward-adding-to-regions-shortage/
Missouri,State Budget,Missouri Independent,"For many Missouri families, any tax cut will be swallowed by rising health care costs","Missouri's state revenue is running $400 million below projections due to a capital gains tax exemption costing $500 million annually, while Governor Kehoe proposes eliminating the $8.7 billion income tax that funds two-thirds of general revenue for core services like schools and Medicaid. The proposal coincides with the expiration of federal ACA subsidies, which will increase healthcare costs by over $1,000 for 417,000 Missourians. This raises critical questions about potential service cuts and revenue replacement, especially since one-time reserves cannot offset permanent tax losses. The situation mirrors Kansas's failed 2012 tax experiment and threatens rural hospitals dependent on Medicaid funding, as 29 are already at risk of closure. State leaders have not specified how they would replace the lost revenue or which services would be reduced.",https://missouriindependent.com/2026/01/10/for-many-missouri-families-any-tax-cut-will-be-swallowed-by-rising-health-care-costs/

Minnesota,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,Minnesota Reformer,Minnesota prosecution of ICE officer faces new political obstacles under Trump,"The Trump administration claimed an ICE agent acted in self-defense when killing a woman in Minneapolis, but state officials were excluded from the investigation when the U.S. Attorney's Office removed the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, raising concerns about federal interference in state accountability. Governor Walz and County Attorney Moriarty expressed doubt about investigative fairness, while legal experts note the agent could claim Supremacy Clause immunity if state charges are filed. The incident reflects a pattern of nine ICE shootings in four months with no recent indictments, prompting debate over whether states can prosecute federal officers for excessive force. Historical precedents exist for state prosecutions of federal agents, though cases face significant federal court hurdles and can take years. Local officials view potential charges as necessary to protest aggressive ICE enforcement and assert that federal agents are not immune from state criminal law.",https://minnesotareformer.com/2026/01/09/minnesota-prosecution-of-ice-officer-faces-new-political-obstacles-under-trump/

The march, organized by groups including Repairers of the Breach and the NC Poor People's Campaign, will coincide with early voting for March 2026 primaries beginning February 12. Organizers aim to protest regressive policies threatening Medicaid, voting rights, and immigrant communities while advocating for healthcare for all, fully funded public education, and living wages. The redistricting, requested by President Trump, transformed North Carolina's only competitive House seat into one that leans Republican by diluting the voting power of rural Black voters in the 1st congressional district.

California,State Budget,CalMatters,"Newsom’s budget shows big revenue gain, but we’ve been  down that path before","Gov. Newsom projects $42.3 billion in additional revenue over three years, funding a $27 billion spending increase in his $321 billion draft budget and covering all but $2.9 billion of new outlays. This follows the administration's 2022 overestimation of a $97.5 billion surplus, which created a structural deficit after income was overstated by $165 billion over four years. While the budget balances in 2026-27 with a $4.5 billion reserve, it projects a $22 billion deficit for 2027-28. Newsom is taking a cautious approach, characterizing the budget as a placeholder to be revised in May with updated revenue data.

Federal courts are systematically rejecting the administration's mandatory detention policy, with immigrants winning 350 of 362 cases. The strategy has created a ""war of attrition"" resulting in record numbers of voluntary departures.
