Greenpeace backed the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe-led movement to halt pipeline construction and is defending against Energy Transfer's North Dakota lawsuit while pursuing EU free speech protections in Dutch courts. Energy Transfer argues the foreign action undermines North Dakota court authority and seeks to block it, while Greenpeace contends the cases are separate and North Dakota lacks jurisdiction over its Dutch entity. The dispute follows a reduced $660 million North Dakota jury verdict against Greenpeace related to protest activities.
