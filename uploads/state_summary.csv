Children in the community express terror, with one texting his grandmother about daily fear and others asking church leaders to ""make ICE disappear.""

Vermont,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,VTDigger,Vermont lawmakers consider the tricky legality of unmasking ICE,"Vermont lawmakers are considering S.208, a bill that would prohibit all law enforcement officers from masking to conceal their identity, with direct implications for federal immigration enforcement agents like ICE operating in the state. Legal experts advise that applying the ban uniformly to all officers—rather than targeting federal agents specifically—strengthens its constitutionality and enforceability against federal immigration officers. State officials are debating whether violations should be civil or criminal, raising concerns that local police would be responsible for citing federal ICE agents, though enforcement would remain discretionary. The Department of Public Safety commissioner warned that if the law cannot be enforced against federal officers, it would be merely a ""feel good"" statute. Sen. Tanya Vyhovsky emphasized the need for immediate implementation, stating ""The terror that's happening can't wait until July to be solved,"" highlighting the bill's significance for immigrant communities.",https://vtdigger.org/2026/01/20/vermont-lawmakers-consider-the-tricky-legality-of-unmasking-ice/

West Virginia,State Budget,West Virginia Watch,The state wants millions from you to keep old people like me locked up,"Senate Bill 137 would impose massive unfunded costs on West Virginia's budget, with each affected inmate costing roughly an additional half-million dollars due to increased sentence minimums from 15 to 25 years. The state's incarceration costs have already spiked 37% in one year to $48,449 per person, driven by exploding medical expenses for an aging prison population where one-third of inmates are now over 50. With over 860 current inmates affected by the bill, total costs could reach hundreds of millions or billions of dollars, yet the Senate Judiciary Committee passed it without requesting a fiscal note. The policy directly conflicts with urgent budget priorities, as evidenced by Hancock County schools requiring $8 million in emergency funding while the state faces rural hospital and childcare closures.
