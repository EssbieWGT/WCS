Minnesota,Public Health,Minnesota Reformer,"In RFK Jr.’s upside-down world of vaccines, panel votes to end hepatitis B shot at birth","HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s vaccine-skeptical appointees on the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices voted 8-3 to end the 34-year recommendation for newborn hepatitis B vaccination, despite the policy having reduced childhood infections by 99% since 1991. The committee, now chaired by pediatric cardiologist Kirk Milhoan who calls mRNA vaccines ""the biggest threat to humanity,"" featured presentations from anti-vaccine lawyers and activists rather than CDC infectious disease experts. This decision comes amid the nation's worst measles outbreak since 1992 and a two-year whooping cough epidemic causing 60,000 cases and six infant deaths. Infectious disease specialists on the panel warned the move adds parental doubt and paperwork barriers, likely reducing vaccination rates based on studies showing ambiguous advice decreases compliance. The shift represents a fundamental transformation of federal vaccine policy from evidence-based disease prevention to accommodating vaccine skepticism, with potential for nearly 500 annual deaths if the hepatitis B birth dose is widely abandoned.",https://minnesotareformer.com/2025/12/07/in-rfk-jr-s-upside-down-world-of-vaccines-panel-votes-to-end-hepatitis-b-shot-at-birth/
