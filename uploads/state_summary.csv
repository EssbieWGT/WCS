North Carolina,State Budget,NC Newsline,"NC Council of State to General Assembly: Invest in workforce, pass NC’s overdue budget","The North Carolina General Assembly's failure to pass a 2025 state budget over disputes on income tax cuts and worker pay raises has forced agencies to operate on 2024 funding continuations, prompting bipartisan criticism from the Council of State: Secretary of State Elaine Marshall reported her office's workload doubled since 2017 without staffing increases and employees remain the second-lowest paid in state government, while Insurance Commissioner Mike Causey faced proposed cuts of 20 positions despite needing more investigators for rising fraud cases. Governor Josh Stein highlighted the broader policy crisis, noting North Carolina ranks 48th in per-pupil spending and 50th in K-12 funding effort, with teachers and public safety officers earning less in real terms than a year ago. Agency heads warned that technology cannot compensate for severe personnel shortages, leaving them unable to meet growing public demands for business filings and fraud investigations. The Council of State unanimously demanded legislators immediately return and pass a comprehensive budget to address systemic understaffing, improve compensation, and properly fund critical state services.",https://ncnewsline.com/2026/01/06/nc-council-of-state-to-general-assembly-invest-in-workforce-pass-ncs-overdue-budget/

Michigan will continue providing all vaccines at no out-of-pocket cost through ACA-regulated insurance and federal programs.

Utah,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,Utah News Dispatch,What we know about how ICE arrests have increased in Utah under Trump,"Immigration arrests in Utah reached at least 3,040 in 2025 under President Trump's crackdown—more than double 2024 levels—with 55% involving criminal convictions, 27% pending charges, and 17% (522 people) detained solely for immigration violations, a sixfold increase from the prior year. The Trump administration maintains it targets the ""worst of the worst,"" claiming 70% of nationwide arrests involve criminal records, though Utah's non-criminal arrest share is lower than the national one-third average. Utah has expanded ICE cooperation through multiple 287(g) agreements enabling local police and sheriffs to enforce federal immigration law, a policy the ACLU warns fuels racial profiling and community fear. Governor Spencer Cox supports the enforcement operations, stating Utah remains ""the most welcoming state"" but ""laws are supposed to be followed,"" while Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall condemned aggressive tactics like the viral airport arrest. Construction industry leaders report workforce disruptions and economic harm, arguing the broad enforcement sweeps up law-abiding workers rather than dangerous criminals, calling on state leaders to demand a more targeted, humane approach.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/2026/01/06/ice-arrests-increased-in-utah-under-trump/
Utah,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,Utah News Dispatch,The lasting impact of Utah’s airport ICE arrest,"The October 2025 viral ICE arrest at Salt Lake City International Airport has fundamentally altered Utah's immigration enforcement landscape, marking a shift to highly visible public apprehensions of individuals without criminal records. The Salvadoran woman was identified through expanded TSA passenger data sharing with ICE, a practice that has intensified under the Trump administration. Immigration attorneys now advise clients with pending green card or asylum applications to avoid air travel entirely, while documented immigrants must carry papers due to increased secondary screenings. The enforcement surge is driven by $30 billion in new congressional funding for ICE and enhanced interagency cooperation, including local 287(g) partnerships like Washington County's.

The elimination of Temporary Protection Status for Venezuelans left approximately 600,000 without work authorization or deportation protection. Immigration attorneys now advise restricted travel after ICE arrests at Salt Lake City airport, while consumers avoid Latino businesses due to profiling fears.
