Utah,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,Utah News Dispatch,What we know about how ICE arrests have increased in Utah under Trump,"Under the Trump administration's aggressive immigration crackdown, Utah saw 3,040 ICE arrests in 2025—more than double 2024's total—with 17% (522 people) detained solely for immigration violations, a sixfold increase from Biden's 7% non-criminal arrest rate. The state has adopted multiple 287(g) agreements enabling local police to enforce federal immigration law, which civil rights advocates say fosters fear and undermines community trust. Governor Spencer Cox supports the enforcement, prioritizing public safety while maintaining Utah is ""welcoming"" to legal immigrants. The Department of Homeland Security defends the policy as targeting ""the worst of the worst,"" though critics argue the approach is overly broad and harms both immigrant communities and Utah's economy.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/2026/01/06/ice-arrests-increased-in-utah-under-trump/

In Utah, this intensified enforcement has created widespread fear, reducing attendance at Latino cultural events by up to 60% and depressing church participation. Community anxiety has been exacerbated by plans for a 10,000-bed ICE detention facility in the state and a high-profile arrest at Salt Lake City airport. Hispanic-owned businesses report skyrocketing expenses and declining revenues as consumers avoid Latino establishments.
