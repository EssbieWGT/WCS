Pennsylvania,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,Pennsylvania Capital-Star,Gov. Shapiro critical of ICE escalation in Minneapolis and other cities,"Gov. Josh Shapiro responded to Philadelphia protests over Trump administration immigration enforcement by asserting Pennsylvania's non-cooperation policy—state police don't ask about status or share data with ICE—and citing preparedness exercises; advocates counter that loopholes remain in state police policy while dozens of local agencies operate under 287(g) agreements with ICE, prompting state legislative proposals to restrict such cooperation.",https://penncapital-star.com/civil-rights-social-justice/shapiro-breaks-silence-on-ice-escalation/
Vermont,Public Opinion Polls,VTDigger,Amy Spear and Megan Sullivan: Vermont trails the nation,"Vermont's Business Climate Survey shows 85% of employers are concerned about elected officials' understanding of economic pressures, citing taxes, regulations, labor shortages, health care costs, and housing as key barriers to growth. This sentiment of a policymaker-business disconnect directly shapes the Vermont Chamber of Commerce's 2026 legislative agenda, which focuses on fiscal predictability, regulatory modernization, workforce and housing solutions, and sector-specific investments.",https://vtdigger.org/2026/01/25/amy-spear-and-megan-sullivan-vermont-trails-the-nation/
Vermont,Public Health,VTDigger,Copley Hospital workers vote to reaffirm union,"Copley Hospital support staff voted 73-38 to maintain their union in an NLRB-supervised election, preserving collective bargaining power over wages and working conditions they state are essential for quality patient care. The vote followed a year of slow contract negotiations and a 5% raise offered only to non-union employees, with administration arguing union seniority rules would reduce management flexibility. Hospital management had advocated for decertification, while workers emphasized that fair compensation directly impacts their ability to serve patients and the community. The outcome maintains unionization for support staff at the Morrisville facility, where nurses have been unionized since 1997. This dispute illustrates how labor conditions and collective bargaining in Vermont's healthcare sector affect hospital operations and public health service delivery.",https://vtdigger.org/2026/01/25/copley-hospital-workers-vote-to-reaffirm-union/
Mississippi,K-12 Education,Mississippi Today,Speaker White makes sure almost ‘everyone voted’ on his school choice/voucher bill,"Mississippi House Speaker Jason White secured narrow 61-59 passage of a school choice/voucher bill through procedural tactics, including delaying the vote to await a specific member's support. Two Republicans abstained—one who would have voted no and another whose position remains unclear. The bill advanced to the Senate on a voice vote after opponents declined to force a recorded reconsideration vote, preserving coalition unity. The legislation faces significant opposition in the Senate, where resistance to public funding for private schools is stronger. If rejected, White may attach the proposal to other legislation, setting up additional votes and political pressure on members.",https://mississippitoday.org/2026/01/25/speaker-white-school-choice-voucher-vote/

Wisconsin,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,Wisconsin Examiner,Another person in Minneapolis shot and killed by feds,"Federal immigration officers shot and killed a third person in Minneapolis within three weeks, prompting Gov. Tim Walz to condemn the incident and speak with the White House. The Department of Homeland Security claimed the man was armed with a gun and two magazines, but the agency's account is being questioned following revelations that previous official statements about earlier shootings were false. The shooting occurred one day after tens of thousands protested ICE in downtown Minneapolis, with law enforcement deploying tear gas to disperse angry demonstrators at the scene. The pattern of fatal shootings by federal immigration agents and the discrepancy between official statements and evidence raises critical questions about use-of-force policies and accountability in immigration enforcement.",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/2026/01/24/another-person-in-minneapolis-shot-and-killed-by-feds/
