Missouri,Public Health,Missouri Independent,"A flesh-eating fly could be back in Missouri soon, experts warn","The New World screwworm fly poses a direct public health threat to humans as it can infest all warm-blooded animals; state and federal officials are implementing a $29.5 million USDA five-pronged plan including sterile insect facilities in Mexico and Texas, while the FDA has conditionally approved Exzolt Cattle-CA1 for cattle treatment. Missouri agencies are establishing surveillance systems with microscopes for larval identification across the state and urging premises registration for animal owners. The flies, now within 70 miles of the U.S. border, could reach Missouri within 1-2 years, with cold weather temporarily slowing their advance. Wildlife populations including deer and elk would be nearly impossible to contain, complicating public health management. The state veterinarian and conservation health chief emphasize monitoring pets and livestock for open wounds, especially for animals transported from affected regions.",https://missouriindependent.com/2026/01/05/a-flesh-eating-fly-could-be-back-in-missouri-soon-experts-warn/
Nebraska,State Budget,Nebraska Examiner,Environmental Trust lottery funds again targeted to help close state budget gap,"Nebraska faces a $471 million budget shortfall worsened by 2023 income tax cuts projected to reduce revenue by $470 million this fiscal year and $702 million in 2026-27. Governor Pillen has proposed $500 million in agency cuts. The Department of Water, Energy and Environment seeks an $8 million transfer from the Environmental Trust for conservation programs and administrative costs, a move critics call an unconstitutional raid on dedicated funds. The proposal will be reviewed by the Legislature's Appropriations Committee during the 2026 session.",https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2026/01/05/environmental-trust-lottery-funds-again-targeted-to-help-close-state-budget-gap/
South Dakota,K-12 Education,South Dakota Searchlight,How South Dakota lawmakers get around a law that ‘dictates’ increased funding for schools,"Governor Rhoden's budget proposes flat K-12 funding, violating the 1995 state law mandating annual increases of 3% or inflation (the ""index factor""), which lawmakers have circumvented four times since 2010 by resetting the funding baseline annually—a practice the Lt. Governor now describes as making the index factor a ""guideline."" This approach has drawn criticism from former officials and education advocates who argue it signals declining state commitment to schools that became dependent on state funding after 1990s reforms. The South Dakota Education Association notes that districts use the index factor for budgeting and teacher contracts, and warns that consistently ignoring it will cause schools to fall behind inflation. One former lawmaker suggests restoring the state sales tax from 4.2% to 4.5% immediately (instead of 2027) to generate the $100+ million needed to meet the funding requirement.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/2026/01/05/how-south-dakota-lawmakers-get-around-a-law-that-dictates-increased-funding-for-schools/

Rhode Island,K-12 Education,Rhode Island Current,"Rhode Island Foundation panel urges R.I. to rewrite school funding formula, boost state share","A Rhode Island Foundation Blue Ribbon Commission proposes increasing the state's K-12 funding share from 38% to 58%, adding $600 million annually to relieve municipal property tax pressure while expanding cost coverage to transportation, safety, and teacher pensions. The plan would raise state spending to $2.16 billion and lower the local share to $1.2 billion, with reforms to student-need weights, mandatory minimum local contributions based on property wealth, and financial transparency. Commission co-chair David Cicilline warned that failing to ensure high-quality public education jeopardizes the state's future. Legislative leaders and Governor Dan McKee have been briefed and will review the recommendations during the upcoming January session, with a Senate presentation scheduled for January 15. The commission suggests phasing in the higher state share over several years as budget conditions allow.",https://rhodeislandcurrent.com/2026/01/05/rhode-island-foundation-panel-urges-r-i-to-rewrite-school-funding-formula-boost-state-share/

Kentucky,Public Health,Kentucky Lantern,UK first in nation to treat small cell lung cancer patient with new immunotherapy,"Kentucky's public health system is combating the state's leading cause of death—lung cancer—exacerbated by the second-highest smoking rate in the nation (17% in 2022). The University of Kentucky Markey Cancer Center is conducting the first U.S. trial of ZG006, a novel therapy for recurrent small cell lung cancer primarily affecting smokers. The Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services provides a state lung cancer screening program (LungCancer@ky.gov) for high-risk individuals aged 50-80 with significant smoking histories. Public health resources include the national quit line (1-800-784-8669) for smoking cessation. Kentucky's lung cancer incidence rate of 84.1 per 100,000 far exceeds the national average of 52.8, underscoring the urgency of these initiatives.",https://kentuckylantern.com/2026/01/05/uk-first-in-nation-to-treat-small-cell-lung-cancer-patient-with-new-immunotherapy/
Ohio,Public Health,Ohio Capital Journal,"Ohio cities rank among the most medically expensive, analysis finds","A new WalletHub study identifies Cleveland, Toledo, and Cincinnati among the nation's most expensive cities for medical care relative to median income, ranking 2nd, 4th, and 11th respectively. This financial burden stems from a combination of low median household incomes—Cleveland's is the nation's lowest at $39,187—and high costs for doctor visits, dental care, and prescription drugs like insulin. Such affordability barriers directly threaten public health by restricting access to essential medical services and medications for Ohio residents. With median incomes falling while healthcare costs outpace inflation, the findings underscore a critical policy challenge for state and local officials to address healthcare access and affordability.",https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2026/01/05/ohio-cities-rank-among-the-most-medically-expensive-analysis-finds/
Maryland,Protests and Civil Unrest,Maryland Matters,Will Maryland be the voice of reason?,"Maryland's debate over partisan congressional redistricting could fuel civil unrest by disenfranchising voters through gerrymandering. State Senate President Bill Ferguson warns that such tactics would poison political civility and undermine democratic principles. The policy choice involves either preserving representative government or engaging in ""base partisanship"" that may destabilize democratic norms. Experts caution that attempting to eliminate the lone Republican seat could backfire and increase public distrust. Rejecting these tactics aims to prevent contributing to national democratic erosion and potential voter backlash.",https://marylandmatters.org/2026/01/04/will-maryland-be-the-voice-of-reason/
