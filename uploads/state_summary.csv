North Carolina,Protests and Civil Unrest,NC Newsline,Protesters gather in downtown Raleigh to condemn apparent US takeover of Venezuela,"Approximately 100 protesters convened in Raleigh's Moore Square on January 3, 2026, to oppose the Trump administration's removal of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and apparent U.S. takeover of Venezuela, with demonstrators arguing the action violated international law, lacked congressional approval, and was primarily motivated by oil interests. Organized by Code Pink, the Party for Socialism and Liberation, and Democratic groups, protesters contended the policy would destabilize regional governments and contradicted Trump's campaign promises to avoid foreign wars. A U.S. military veteran among the participants compared Trump's actions to Russian aggression in Ukraine, warning it jeopardizes American security and service members. The protest specifically challenged the administration's plan to deploy U.S. oil companies to rebuild Venezuela's petroleum infrastructure and sell its reserves internationally. North Carolina Republicans countered by praising the action as a victory for law and order that protects Americans, highlighting a sharp partisan divide over executive authority and foreign intervention.",https://ncnewsline.com/2026/01/03/protesters-gather-in-downtown-raleigh-to-condemn-apparent-us-takeover-of-venezuela/
North Carolina,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,NC Newsline,Davis joins NC Republicans in praising raid in Venezuela; Ross questions constitutionality of action,"The U.S. military capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro on narco-terrorism charges relates to immigration enforcement because Venezuela's political instability is a primary driver of migration to the U.S., and this intervention could significantly alter asylum seeker and refugee flows. North Carolina's elected officials split along party lines: Republicans like Sen. Ted Budd and Rep. Richard Hudson praise the action for combating drug trafficking, while Democrats like Rep. Deborah Ross criticize the unconstitutional bypass of congressional authorization. Rep. Don Davis demands congressional oversight to ensure transparency in military operations affecting national security and immigration patterns. Critics warn that destabilizing Venezuela may increase migration pressures, while supporters argue it addresses narco-trafficking that undermines border security. The situation exemplifies how foreign policy decisions directly impact domestic immigration enforcement challenges.",https://ncnewsline.com/2026/01/03/davis-joins-nc-republicans-in-praising-raid-in-venezuela-ross-questions-constitutionality-of-action/
