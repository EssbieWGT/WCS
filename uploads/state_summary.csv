Missouri,State Budget,Missouri Independent,Missouri auditor warns of vanishing state general revenue surplus as spending rises,"Missouri Auditor Scott Fitzpatrick projects the state's general revenue surplus will be depleted by June 2028, creating a $370 million shortfall under current forecasts or a $3.8 billion gap if recession occurs.

Republicans advocate broad spending reviews while Democrats blame tax cuts for wealthy earners for threatening core services. Both parties acknowledge immediate spending restraint is necessary to avoid emergency cuts, as spending has exceeded revenues since FY2023.",https://missouriindependent.com/2025/12/29/missouri-auditor-warns-of-vanishing-state-general-revenue-surplus-as-spending-rises/
