New Mexico,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,Source New Mexico,Immigration in New Mexico: top stories of 2025,"ICE arrests in New Mexico surged from about 240 in 2024 to over 1,800 in the first 10 months of 2025 under Trump's mass deportation push, which included establishing a militarized ""National Defense Zone"" and painting border walls black to deter climbing; the state responded by joining litigation against executive orders, passing laws allowing immigrants to become police officers and prohibiting state employees from sharing immigration information, while the Legislature failed to pass the Immigrant Safety Act to end ICE detention contracts despite growing scrutiny of facilities in Torrance, Cibola, and Otero counties.",https://sourcenm.com/2025/12/29/immigration-top-stories-of-2025/
Washington,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,Washington State Standard,"In Washington orchards, immigration crackdown sows fear and uncertainty","The Trump administration's immigration crackdown has targeted farmworkers primarily through arrests outside workplaces rather than orchard raids, with ICE detentions in central Washington increasing from 1-2 to 5-10 daily by late November 2025. Legislative efforts to provide legal pathways, such as Rep. Dan Newhouse's ""Farm Workforce Modernization Act,"" have stalled despite bipartisan recognition that undocumented immigrants comprise an estimated 40% of agricultural labor. The administration has instead expanded the H-2A visa program and proposed rule changes to reduce employer costs, prompting legal challenges from farmworker advocates. The enforcement surge has created widespread fear among workers, with some abandoning harvests and advocacy groups organizing surveillance of ICE activities, while growers remain publicly silent due to fear of federal retaliation. This tension reflects an internal administration conflict between hardline deportation advocates and agricultural interests, though no formal protections for farmworkers have materialized.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/2025/12/29/in-washington-orchards-immigration-crackdown-sows-fear-and-uncertainty/
Tennessee,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,Tennessee Lookout,"Afghans flee Taliban, find refuge and faith — and ICE — in Memphis","The Trump administration reversed Biden-era policies for Afghan refugees, halting immigration processing and ordering ICE to detain those admitted after the 2021 withdrawal. In Memphis, Afghan families who legally entered via the CBP One app with I-94 travel documents and pending asylum hearings have been arrested and sent to Texas detention facilities. The policy shift threatens primarily Christian converts and ethnic Hazara minorities, prompting local faith leaders to mobilize legal support and advocate against deportations.",https://tennesseelookout.com/2025/12/29/afghans-flee-taliban-find-refuge-and-faith-and-ice-in-memphis/
New Jersey,State Budget,New Jersey Monitor,New Jersey gas tax to increase 4.2 cents,"New Jersey increased transportation trust fund revenue targets to $2.1 billion this fiscal year (up from $2 billion) under a 2024 law, with goals reaching $2.4 billion by 2028, triggering an automatic 4.2-cent gas tax hike. The increase—largest since 2021—reflects state fiscal policy to maintain infrastructure spending despite a projected 1% fuel use decline. This demonstrates how statutory revenue targets drive tax policy to meet budget commitments. The 2016 law establishing automatic adjustments ensures transportation funding remains stable regardless of consumption trends. The action directly impacts state budget planning by prioritizing dedicated revenue for roads, bridges, and transportation projects.",https://newjerseymonitor.com/briefs/new-jersey-gas-tax-increase/
Arkansas,Public Health,Arkansas Advocate,"Arkansas’ maternity ward shortage sometimes leads to births in ambulances, paramedics say","Arkansas's maternal health crisis is intensifying as six maternity wards have closed since 2020, forcing rural pregnant women to travel 30-90 minutes to delivering hospitals and causing increased births in ambulances. Medicaid covers over half of state births but reimburses ambulance services below cost, creating financial strain on rural providers. All 75 counties have ""ambulance deserts"" with response times exceeding 25 minutes, and 71% of rural emergency rooms managed urgent obstetric transports in 2023. The Rural Emergency Hospital designation, which cuts inpatient services including surgery, leaves facilities like Progressive Health of Helena without on-site surgeons for obstetric emergencies. Industry leaders report paramedics lack funding for newborn-specific equipment and blood storage, despite being tasked with filling healthcare access gaps created by hospital closures.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/2025/12/29/arkansas-maternity-ward-shortage-sometimes-leads-to-births-in-ambulances-paramedics-say/
Virginia,Public Health,Virginia Mercury,Virginia awaits decision on $1 billion rural health grant,"Virginia's $1 billion Rural Health Transformation Fund application proposes four initiatives to address rural healthcare access challenges, provider shortages, and technology modernization. The proposal comes as state officials brace for Medicaid eligibility changes in the reconciliation bill that could strip coverage from hundreds of thousands of Virginians, straining rural hospitals and free clinics preparing for patient surges. These policy changes compound existing challenges in maternal health deserts and limited specialist access across 60% of Virginia's rural localities.",https://virginiamercury.com/2025/12/29/virginia-awaits-decision-on-1-billion-rural-health-grant/
Colorado,Public Health,Colorado Newsline,Colorado needs transparency around asbestos contamination,"The article relates to public health by documenting Colorado's 3,214 asbestos-related deaths (1999-2017) and advocating for transparent CDC/NIOSH registries to replace fragmented trust fund and VA systems that conceal exposure data, preventing effective disease tracking for veterans, workers, and families.",https://coloradonewsline.com/2025/12/29/colorado-needs-transparency-around-asbestos/
Maine,State Budget,Maine Morning Star,Budget pressures facing lawmakers in January — and how to address them,"Maine's $250 million revenue surplus is threatened by HR 1 and other federal policies that could cost $300 million annually through cost-shifts and tax conformity, while the state budget underfunds critical programs like care workers and community college; three progressive revenue bills advancing in the legislature could generate $360 million, presenting policymakers with a choice between accepting federal cuts or raising taxes on wealthy corporations and individuals to protect vulnerable residents.",https://mainemorningstar.com/2025/12/29/budget-pressures-facing-lawmakers-in-january-and-how-to-address-them/
Florida,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,Florida Phoenix,"Alligator Alcatraz, visa crackdown, mass detention: Year’s top immigration stories","Florida enacted SB-4C in February, establishing state immigration penalties and ICE partnerships, which resulted in the wrongful arrest of U.S. citizen Juan Lopez-Gomez and a federal contempt order against Attorney General James Uthmeier for defying a court block. The state opened ""Alligator Alcatraz"" in July as the nation's first state-run detention center, which faced December torture allegations from Amnesty International and inspired similar facilities nationwide. Gov. DeSantis directed universities to halt H-1B visa hiring in October, while reports emerged of influencers exploiting O-1B ""extraordinary talent"" visas. The legislation created rare conflict between DeSantis and Republican legislative leaders, who initially killed his proposals before passing a compromised version. Federal courts have temporarily blocked key provisions, creating ongoing state-federal jurisdictional disputes over immigration enforcement.",https://floridaphoenix.com/2025/12/29/alligator-alcatraz-visa-crackdown-mass-detention-years-top-immigration-stories/
