Virginia,Public Opinion Polls,Virginia Mercury,"Poll: Virginians plan to spend less this holiday season as prices, job market weigh on budgets","A Roanoke College Institute for Policy and Opinion Research survey of 912 Virginians (Nov. 9–14) finds households plan to reduce holiday spending by 5% to $1,035 on average, shifting budgets toward gifts (+10.6%) while cutting personal purchases (-16.5%) and experiences (-19.6%). The poll reveals 56% of purchases will occur online, up four points from 2024, highlighting consumer demand for value amid economic uncertainty. Analysts attribute caution to inflation (~3%), softening labor markets, and tariff-driven cost pressures on imports like apparel and electronics. Lower-income households concentrate spending under $100 while higher-income Virginians plan to spend over $1,000, showing income-based divergence. Dr. Alice Louise Kassens advises retailers to prioritize digital presence and competitive pricing, as consumer spending—representing 70% of the economy—shows households balancing optimism with restraint.",https://virginiamercury.com/2025/11/28/poll-virginians-plan-to-spend-less-this-holiday-season-as-prices-job-market-weigh-on-budgets/
Nebraska,State Budget,Nebraska Examiner,"Port authority leaders say state is withholding funds, slowing economic progress in northeast Omaha","The State of Nebraska faces a growing $471 million deficit as the Legislature prepares for its January session, with the Pillen administration actively seeking budget trims. This fiscal context surrounds the State Treasurer's withholding of $11 million in statutorily mandated funds from the Omaha Inland Port Authority, despite legislative language stating the grant should not be subject to further review. The funding dispute threatens state-funded projects including a $90 million North Omaha business park and a $30 million innovation district.",https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2025/11/28/port-authority-leaders-say-state-is-withholding-funds-slowing-economic-progress-in-northeast-omaha/
Connecticut,Public Health,CT Mirror,"Federal grants for Yale research on malaria were cut, but the work continues","Federal funding cuts have cancelled or paused NIH and USAID grants for malaria research at Yale and UConn, totaling tens of millions of dollars in losses. The cancellations disrupt critical public health research on disease transmission tracking and next-generation vaccine development for malaria, which caused 1.2 million cases in Senegal alone last year. At Yale, specific projects aimed at developing biomarkers to monitor outbreak spread and vaccine efficacy have been halted or delayed. Researchers have been forced to seek philanthropic support to continue time-sensitive work, including genomic surveillance training in Chad. The funding loss jeopardizes both global health efforts and Connecticut's capacity for scientific innovation and outbreak preparedness.",https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/28/yale-malaria-research-federal-cuts/
