Connecticut,State Budget,CT Mirror,Borrowing for transportation on Lamont’s chopping block,"Connecticut's Special Transportation Fund projects insolvency by 2029 due to flat fuel and sales tax revenues, forcing a reduction in transportation borrowing from $1.4 billion to $1.1 billion annually; despite General Fund surpluses averaging $1.8 billion, most funds are committed to pension debt paydown, creating a policy conflict between infrastructure investment and fiscal restraint as the governor prepares his February budget proposal.",https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/08/ct-transportation-borrowing/
Missouri,Public Health,Missouri Independent,"Nurses say staff shortage at Missouri prison means skipped medication, long waits for care","A staffing crisis at Jefferson City Correctional Center under Missouri's $1 billion contract with Centurion Health has left incarcerated people without essential medications and canceled sick call for weeks, prompting State Rep.

South Carolina,Public Health,SC Daily Gazette,"MUSC Health seeks $350M for new, top-tier cancer center","The Medical University of South Carolina is requesting $350 million from the state legislature to build South Carolina's first Comprehensive Cancer Center. This would address the state's higher-than-average cancer mortality by providing specialized care currently unavailable in-state. The center would expand research, community outreach, and services including surgery, stem cell transplantation, and chemotherapy. The request builds on $15 million in annual state funding committed since 2022.",https://scdailygazette.com/2025/12/08/musc-health-seeks-350m-for-new-top-tier-cancer-center/
Nebraska,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,Nebraska Examiner,"Nebraska lawmaker was twice denied entry to McCook ICE jail, calls it law violation","Nebraska State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh was twice denied entry to the state-run McCook ICE detention facility despite state statute 83-186 granting legislators access to correctional facilities ""at any time,"" prompting her to petition the Legislature's Executive Committee for intervention. Corrections Director Rob Jeffreys refused entry citing ICE security protocols and operational safety, arguing the law must be interpreted ""in harmony"" with federal partner needs. Cavanaugh maintains the state-ICE contract voids any provisions contradicting state law. The dispute creates a constitutional conflict over legislative oversight authority for immigration detention operations and raises questions about transparency for detainees held without criminal charges.",https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2025/12/08/nebraska-lawmaker-was-twice-denied-entry-to-mccook-ice-jail-calls-it-law-violation/
Louisiana,Public Health,Louisiana Illuminator,Louisiana’s new surgeon general is a vaccine skeptic aligned with anti-abortion forces,"Dr. Evelyn Griffin, appointed Louisiana's surgeon general by Gov. Jeff Landry, serves on the CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, where she recently voted to delay hepatitis B vaccination for most newborns and to separate the MMR-chickenpox combination vaccine. These positions align with U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s anti-vaccine policy agenda. Griffin previously opposed COVID-19 vaccine mandates for students, claiming children faced greater risk from lightning than COVID, and supports Louisiana's strict abortion ban, framing all her positions as ""pro-informed consent.""",https://lailluminator.com/2025/12/08/louisiana-surgeon-general/
Wisconsin,State Budget,Wisconsin Examiner,Wisconsin grapples with prospect of losing federal housing funds,"Federal HUD cuts to Continuum of Care funds create a state budget shortfall for Wisconsin's homelessness programs, as 52% of permanent housing funding comes from this federal source; the elimination of over $12 million in Milwaukee County alone forces state and local governments to choose between absorbing the gap—leaving 2,379 people homeless during winter—or reallocating state budget resources, amid lawsuits and Congressional intervention efforts.",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/2025/12/08/communities-grapple-with-prospect-of-losing-federal-housing-funds/
Rhode Island,Public Health,Rhode Island Current,A new medical school won’t cure R.I.’s primary care shortage. Here’s a better idea.,"Rhode Island's primary care shortage, driven by physician wages ranking 48th nationally and the highest malpractice costs, has prompted a legislative commission to propose a $245 million public medical school at URI despite fewer than half of residency graduates remaining in-state. The article argues this funding is misguided given the state's projected $462 million budget deficit by 2030 and the nine-year delay before the first physicians would graduate. Instead, policymakers should invest in existing nurse practitioner programs at Rhode Island College, Salve Regina, and URI, as NPs and PAs already deliver one in four Medicare visits and can be trained more quickly and cost-effectively. Recent government actions include a $40 million Medicaid reimbursement increase and a planned 2026 review of commercial insurance rates. Expanding NP scholarships offers a faster solution to strengthen the state's healthcare workforce than building a new medical school.",https://rhodeislandcurrent.com/2025/12/08/a-new-medical-school-wont-cure-r-i-s-primary-care-shortage-heres-what-will/
Hawaii,State Budget,Honolulu Civil Beat,Green Suggests Hawaiʻi Might Scale Back On Income Tax Cuts,"The governor will likely tap Hawaii's rainy day reserve for hundreds of millions of dollars to balance the state budget, signaling a substantial deficit.

Ohio,Protests and Civil Unrest,Ohio Capital Journal,Strauss survivors protest outside Ohio State Trustees meeting,"Survivors of sexual abuse by former Ohio State University doctor Richard Strauss protested outside the school's Board of Trustees meeting, expressing frustration over ongoing litigation where nearly 300 survivors have settled for $60 million but hundreds more refuse. Protesters highlighted conflicts of interest involving board chairman John Zeiger's legal representation of former trustee Les Wexner—who oversaw 1996 disciplinary proceedings against Strauss—and criticized the recent hire of former president E. Gordon Gee, who led the university during initial investigations. The demonstration occurred as a federal judge ordered mediation in five remaining lawsuits, warning that litigation victories may be pyrrhic, while survivors noted the university's past pursuit of statute of limitations defenses to the Supreme Court as evidence of institutional obstinance.",https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2025/12/08/strauss-survivors-protest-outside-ohio-state-trustees-meeting/
