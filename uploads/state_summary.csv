Nebraska,State Budget,Nebraska Examiner,"Port authority leaders say state is withholding funds, slowing economic progress in northeast Omaha","Nebraska faces a $471 million state budget deficit, prompting the Pillen administration and legislators to seek budget trims in the upcoming January session. The $11 million in state funds withheld from the Omaha Inland Port Authority (OIPA) is caught in this fiscal climate, with the state treasurer refusing release despite statutory authorization. The disputed funds originate from interest on state funding pools for projects like the Perkins County Canal and new prisons. OIPA leaders, including State Sen. Terrell McKinney, contend the law clearly mandates release and are considering legal action. The funding standoff reflects broader legislative scrutiny of OIPA projects amid the state's tightening fiscal constraints.",https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2025/11/28/port-authority-leaders-say-state-is-withholding-funds-slowing-economic-progress-in-northeast-omaha/
Mississippi,K-12 Education,Mississippi Today,Oxford superintendent proposes ‘better kind’ of school choice from cradle to career,"Challenged by Mississippi legislators to offer school choice alternatives, the Oxford School District superintendent proposes state investments in universal early childhood education and a three-pathway high school system offering college-ready, applied-learning, and direct-to-career tracks. This policy would strengthen public schools, address workforce shortages, and deliver better economic returns than voucher programs.",https://mississippitoday.org/2025/11/28/oxford-superintendent-school-choice-cradle-to-career/
Iowa,Public Health,Iowa Capital Dispatch,Resident deaths lead to fines at three Iowa care facilities,"The Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing has fined three care facilities for regulatory violations linked to resident deaths: Northgate Care Center ($10,000) for medication errors and inadequate assessment after a resident fell; REM Iowa ($500) for inadequate supervision of an epilepsy patient; and Harmony House Health Center ($500) for failing to address a resident's fatal ingestion of non-food items. These enforcement actions reveal critical gaps in medication safety, resident monitoring, and risk assessment protocols within Iowa's long-term care system. The Northgate case involved a licensed practical nurse concealing the full scope of a medication error from treating physicians, compromising patient care and contributing to the resident's death. The incidents highlight systemic failures in staff accountability, communication with medical professionals, and protection of vulnerable residents with complex health needs. The state's regulatory response demonstrates government oversight of healthcare facilities to address patient safety violations and prevent future harm.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/2025/11/28/resident-deaths-lead-to-fines-at-three-iowa-care-facilities/
Virginia,Public Opinion Polls,Virginia Mercury,"Poll: Virginians plan to spend less this holiday season as prices, job market weigh on budgets","The Roanoke College Institute for Policy and Opinion Research poll of 912 Virginians (Nov. 9-14) reveals planned holiday spending will average $1,035, a 5% decrease, with allocations shifting toward gifts (+10.6%) and away from personal purchases (-16.5%) and experiences (-19.6%). The survey identifies tariff-driven price pressures and softening labor-market indicators as key concerns dampening consumer confidence despite robust GDP growth. Digital commerce dominates, with 56% of purchases expected online, up four points from 2024. Results mirror national trends: Gallup shows flat gift spending at $1,007, while Deloitte reports a 10% decline in overall holiday budgets.

Connecticut,Public Health,CT Mirror,"Federal grants for Yale research on malaria were cut, but the work continues","Federal funding cuts have cancelled Yale University malaria research grants worth tens of millions of dollars, disrupting epidemiological studies and genomic surveillance capabilities that could inform Connecticut's healthcare industry response to disease outbreaks. The cancellations affect vaccine development and biomarker tracking research conducted in Connecticut, which trains international scientists in technologies transferable to U.S. hospital systems for monitoring emerging diseases. University officials report the funding loss has delayed life-saving medical breakthroughs, with Yale providing only $1.6 million in short-term bridge funding. The cuts have postponed training programs for DNA sequencing of parasites, impacting global capacity-building that researchers say directly applies to understanding diseases prevalent in the U.S. Scientists emphasize that surveillance methods developed through this Connecticut-based research could be adapted for domestic outbreak detection and healthcare system preparedness.",https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/28/yale-malaria-research-federal-cuts/
