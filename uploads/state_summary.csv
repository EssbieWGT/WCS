Connecticut,K-12 Education,CT Mirror,Capital Prep sues over CT charter school funding process,"Capital Preparatory Charter School filed a lawsuit challenging the Connecticut Board of Education's ruling that it lacks authority to fund charter schools, seeking to overturn a 2015 law requiring legislative budget approval and secure funding for its approved Middletown location.

Governor Lamont's office dismissed the claims as ""baseless,"" while the school argues that legislative interference politicizes the funding process and undermines the board's approval authority. The dispute centers on whether the board or legislature should decide which approved charter schools receive state funds, with implications for Connecticut's charter school authorization process. The case could set precedent redefining the balance of power between education agencies and lawmakers in allocating K-12 resources.",https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/18/capital-prep-sues-over-ct-charter-school-funding-process/

Kentucky,State Budget,Kentucky Lantern,Beshear request to help cover budget shortfall meets pushback from GOP state officials,"Kentucky faces a $156 million revenue shortfall, prompting Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear to order 3% budget cuts across many executive branch agencies while exempting K-12 education, higher education, pensions, and public safety, generating $77.7 million in General Fund reductions. Republican constitutional officers are resisting these cuts, citing new budget language that gives them discretion to opt out, breaking a decades-long precedent of uniform reductions. House Speaker David Osborne criticized the across-the-board approach, urging strategic decisions instead of cuts that risk harming essential services. The state has billions in its Budget Reserve Trust Fund as an alternative to cuts, and the revenue forecast has already improved from an earlier $305 million projection. The dispute highlights a shift in budget authority from the governor's office to independently elected officials under recent GOP-led legislation.",https://kentuckylantern.com/2025/12/18/beshear-request-to-help-cover-budget-shortfall-meets-pushback-from-gop-state-officials/
