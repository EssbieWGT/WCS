Rhode Island,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,Rhode Island Current,AG candidate wants lawmakers to denounce ICE tactics,"Rep. Jason Knight (D-Barrington) introduced a resolution condemning ICE's ""military-style"" enforcement tactics, including masked agents conducting raids and detaining individuals outside Rhode Island courthouses; the measure, referred to the House Judiciary Committee, cites a November 11 Warren raid arresting a Liberian national and the November 20 detention of a teenage judicial intern in Providence, which Chief Justice Paul Suttell called ""egregious""; the resolution argues these tactics terrorize communities rather than target criminals and are unnecessary for effective immigration enforcement.",https://rhodeislandcurrent.com/briefs/ag-candidate-wants-lawmakers-to-denounce-ice-tactics/
Wyoming,State Budget,WyoFile,Tens of millions denied for Wyoming health department budget,"The Wyoming Joint Appropriations Committee approved multi-million-dollar cuts to the Department of Health budget, stripping $58 million in federal Indian Health Service funds and denying $8.5 million in state and matching funds for Critical Access Hospital maternity services. Freedom Caucus members, led by Rep. John Bear, defended the cuts as necessary to halt government growth and protect taxpayers, while opponents warned the reductions could trigger lawsuits, violate constitutional duties to vulnerable populations, and force expecting mothers to leave the state for care. The committee also removed $344 million in federal Rural Health Transformation Program funds from the biennium budget to consider it as separate legislation.",https://wyofile.com/tens-of-millions-denied-for-wyoming-health-department-budget/

Wisconsin,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,Wisconsin Examiner,Attorney General Kaul says Minnesota ICE action harms public safety,"Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul condemned ICE's role in Minnesota after the shooting death of Renee Nicole Good, noting his office filed legal briefs supporting jurisdictions suing to remove federal personnel from cities and is preparing for similar federal actions in Wisconsin, while raising concerns about federal obstruction of the investigation, the FBI targeting the victim's wife, and ICE tactics that he says target people based on race and ethnicity, ultimately making communities less safe.",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/briefs/attorney-general-kaul-says-minnesota-ice-action-harms-public-safety/
Wisconsin,Protests and Civil Unrest,Wisconsin Examiner,Social Security workers’ union joins retiree group to rally at agency’s offices for better funding,"Wisconsinites are holding rallies in eight communities—including Greenfield, Eau Claire, Madison, Racine, Rhinelander, Stevens Point, Wausau, and Wisconsin Rapids—organized by AFGE Council 220 and the Wisconsin Alliance for Retired Americans to protest staff reductions and office closures at the Social Security Administration and demand increased funding. The protests highlight concerns that the agency's workforce has dropped from 58,000 to 50,000 employees over the past year, with about 2,000 field staff lost, creating service bottlenecks for seniors seeking benefits. Union leaders argue the cuts undermine community-based service, forcing longer wait times and phone delays, while the agency defends its ""digital first"" modernization as improving efficiency. The rallies coincide with a national day of action as Congress negotiates budget deadlines and potential government shutdown, with organizers emphasizing that over 10,000 people daily become eligible for Social Security benefits. A recent report also revealed that 54% of Social Security workers earn less than MIT's living wage calculation for their regions, adding labor concerns to the public service impacts.",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/2026/01/14/social-security-workers-union-joins-retiree-group-to-rally-at-agencys-offices-for-better-funding/

Minnesota,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,Minnesota Reformer,"Minneapolis is distancing police from ICE, showing reform is possible","Minneapolis amended its separation ordinance and MPD immigration policy to prohibit assisting ICE with raids, removals, crowd control, or escorting agents absent immediate threats, while affirming First Amendment protest rights and requiring officers to intervene against federal excessive force when safe.

Minnesota,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,Minnesota Reformer,We found more than 40 cases of immigration agents using banned chokeholds,"Immigration enforcement agents have used banned chokeholds and neck restraints in over 40 cases across the U.S., often against citizens and protesters, violating DHS policies that prohibit such tactics unless deadly force is authorized. The Department of Homeland Security and White House have defended these actions as consistent with training, despite expert condemnation from former immigration officials and law enforcement veterans who call the practices dangerous and unprofessional. ProPublica's investigation found agents frequently employ these maneuvers during routine arrests and protests, not just imminent threats, with incidents documented in Charlotte, Houston, Los Angeles, and other cities. In response, states like California and Illinois have passed laws requiring agent identification and allowing civil lawsuits, while the Trump administration has challenged these measures as unconstitutional. The federal government does not track these incidents, and agents wearing masks operate with little oversight or accountability, creating what experts describe as a broken system where banned tactics have become normalized.",https://minnesotareformer.com/2026/01/14/we-found-more-than-40-cases-of-immigration-agents-using-banned-chokeholds/

State leaders and critics, including Gov. Mike DeWine and Rep. Anita Somani, welcomed the funds but deemed them insufficient—a ""band-aid"" for a ""severed artery""—as they fail to fully offset federal cuts or prevent further closures. The funding will target public health priorities in rural areas, including school-based health centers, the OhioSEE child vision program, and infant mortality reduction.
