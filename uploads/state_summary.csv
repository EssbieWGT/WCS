Iowa,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,Iowa Capital Dispatch,Another Iowa jail sued over DOJ policy on detaining immigrants without bond,"The Trump administration's July 2025 policy mandating detention without bond for individuals who entered the U.S. without inspection—reversing three decades of precedent granting bond hearings to long-term residents facing deportation—has sparked hundreds of lawsuits nationwide, including one by an Uzbek asylum-seeker detained at Iowa's Hardin County Jail; while federal district courts have overwhelmingly ruled that detainees retain due process rights to bond hearings, immigration judges continue to deny them under the administration's interpretation, creating a systemic conflict between judicial systems.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/2025/11/25/another-iowa-jail-sued-over-doj-policy-on-detaining-immigrants-without-bond/

Louisiana,Protests and Civil Unrest,Louisiana Illuminator,Child care workers are building a network of resistance against ICE,"ICE arrests of childcare workers in Chicago have sparked demonstrations and rapid formation of resistance networks, including parent-organized safety patrols with whistles and escorts for teachers; community mobilization features a GoFundMe raising over $150,000, meal trains, and legal clinics, while the Trump administration's removal of federal ""sensitive locations"" protections for daycares has prompted emergency SEIU training protocols to protect workers and children from government enforcement.",https://lailluminator.com/2025/11/25/child-care-ice/
Alabama,Protests and Civil Unrest,Alabama Reflector,Alabama clergy lead protest to secure SNAP benefits,"On Nov. 24, 2025, Alabama clergy protested at the Montgomery federal courthouse against the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), calling on U.S. Sens. Katie Britt and Tommy Tuberville to restore funding cuts to Medicaid and SNAP benefits. The protest, part of the ""Moral Mondays"" movement, highlighted that 726,000 Alabamians receive SNAP and over 1 million are enrolled in Medicaid. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimates 137,000 residents will lose SNAP benefits due to OBBBA's work requirements. Organizers reported churches and ministries cannot meet the growing food assistance demand, having turned away 70 people at a recent distribution. The clergy sought meetings with the senators for weeks to discuss policy and pray together, framing the cuts as ""policy violence"" against vulnerable populations.",https://alabamareflector.com/2025/11/25/alabama-clergy-lead-protest-to-secure-snap-benefits/
Massachusetts,Public Health,CommonWealth Beacon,State audit claims 2023 maternity unit closure in Leominster was preventable,"A state audit of UMass Memorial Health found the system's 2023 closure of its Leominster maternity unit, despite receiving $6.2 million in COVID relief grants, created public health disparities for MassHealth patients who now face increased travel distances, ambulance deliveries, and strained emergency services, leading Auditor Diana DiZoglio to recommend the hospital invest future state funds in essential services and regional maternity care access.",https://commonwealthbeacon.org/health-care/state-audit-claims-2023-maternity-unit-closure-in-leominster-was-preventable/
Wyoming,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,WyoFile,Laramie County sheriff’s deputies making more immigration arrests around Wyoming’s largest city,"Laramie County Sheriff Brian Kozak and 25 deputies have participated in federal immigration enforcement through the ICE 287(g) program, resulting in approximately 70 undocumented immigrant arrests in the past two months, including 40 commercial truck drivers detained during a recent three-day operation targeting safety violations. While Kozak maintains his office does not proactively enforce immigration law and only checks status during traffic stops for crimes ranging from felonies to minor infractions, the ACLU of Wyoming has raised concerns about racial profiling and overbroad enforcement that extends beyond the ""worst of the worst"" criminals. The operation, conducted alongside ICE and the Wyoming Highway Patrol, represents the most concentrated immigration enforcement in the state during President Trump's second term and reflects Wyoming's political alignment with increased local-federal cooperation. Kozak's approach—handing detainees directly to ICE rather than prosecuting local misdemeanor charges—has intensified debate over whether the program invites discriminatory policing, though the sheriff insists all laws were enforced equally regardless of immigration status. The enforcement activity highlights a policy tension between public safety justifications and civil liberties advocates' warnings about constitutional protections in immigrant communities.",https://wyofile.com/laramie-county-sheriffs-deputies-making-more-immigration-arrests-around-wyomings-largest-city/
Kentucky,Public Health,Kentucky Lantern,Third unvaccinated Kentucky baby dies of whooping cough,"Kentucky is experiencing its largest pertussis outbreak since 2012, with 566 cases and three infant deaths in the past 12 months, all among unvaccinated infants and mothers. Despite state school vaccination requirements, only 86% of kindergarteners and 85% of seventh-graders are current on immunizations. Dr. Steven Stack, secretary of the Cabinet for Health and Family Services, has urged all Kentuckians to update vaccinations to prevent further spread. Public health officials emphasize maternal vaccination during pregnancy and infant immunization starting at two months as critical protective measures. The outbreak reflects declining vaccination rates nationwide and strains public health resources.",https://kentuckylantern.com/2025/11/25/third-unvaccinated-kentucky-baby-dies-of-whooping-cough/
Tennessee,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,Tennessee Lookout,"Christian Singers Caught In Deportation Net, One Branded ‘Worst of Worst’","The Memphis Safe Task Force arrested Guatemalan brothers Delmar and Eber Gomez on immigration charges during a traffic stop, resulting in Eber's deportation and Delmar's ongoing detention in Louisiana. The Trump administration's Department of Homeland Security disseminated false information about Delmar Gomez, misidentifying him as a Mexican drug dealer and falsely claiming he had an aggravated assault charge, while the agency has not corrected these errors. This case exemplifies the administration's broader immigration crackdown policy, which has led to the detention of thousands of immigrants with minor or no criminal records, including 74% of ICE detainees lacking any criminal convictions. The policy shift has made bond release nearly impossible, forcing immigrants to fight deportation from detention or accept deportation under duress, causing severe hardship for families like the Gomezes, who are longtime Memphis residents with U.S. citizen children. Local officials report that immigration arrests comprise about 20% of task force activity, with most detainees having no criminal history beyond unlawful presence, contradicting the administration's public narrative of targeting ""worst of the worst"" criminals.",https://tennesseelookout.com/2025/11/25/christian-singers-caught-in-deportation-net-one-branded-worst-of-worst/
Virginia,K-12 Education,Virginia Mercury,"Falling enrollment, higher expenses complicate Virginia’s K-12 budget outlook","Virginia's K-12 budget projections are delayed by uncertain enrollment data and a decades-old funding formula that undercounts English Learners and special needs students, with baseline costs reaching at least $844 million for the biennium. Lawmakers must also cover $3.1 billion in teacher salary increases while reconciling a $122 million gap between House and Senate projections on funding the Virginia Preschool Initiative.

The bill requires evidence-based interventions including high-dosage tutoring at least three days per week, additional instruction time, and extended school calendars.

Idaho,State Budget,Idaho Capital Sun,Gov. Little: Idaho Legislature to make ‘significant’ budget decisions in 2026 legislative session,"Idaho faces a projected budget deficit of $58.4 million for the current fiscal year, potentially rising to $555.2 million by 2027, driven by $4 billion in tax cuts since 2021 and a federal bill that could further reduce annual revenue by $284.4 million. In response, Gov. Brad Little has ordered 3% mid-year budget cuts across state agencies, including a 4% reduction in Medicaid provider reimbursement rates. The state maintains 22% of its general fund in a rainy day fund, which Little is reluctant to tap, stating ""I don't think it's raining."" Little emphasized a conservative fiscal ethos of not spending money the state doesn't have and living within means while limiting government growth. The budget shortfall is forcing significant spending decisions, though Little expressed optimism about the state's overall trajectory.",https://idahocapitalsun.com/2025/11/24/gov-little-idaho-legislature-to-make-significant-budget-decisions-in-2026-legislative-session/
North Carolina,Protests and Civil Unrest,NC Newsline,"Bishop William Barber and NC clergy condemn health care cuts, urge legislators to return to Raleigh","Bishop William Barber and dozens of activists protested at the North Carolina General Assembly, carrying a makeshift casket to symbolically eulogize those who may die from Medicaid cuts and expiring ACA tax credits. The demonstration follows state cuts to Medicaid provider payments of 3-10% due to a legislative funding shortfall, with enhanced ACA subsidies set to expire December 31, 2025. Democratic Governor Josh Stein has demanded a special session to restore funding, but Republican leaders have refused despite both chambers approving separate funding plans. Protesters called on lawmakers to end partisan politics and address what they term ""policy violence"" against vulnerable residents.

Vermont,Protests and Civil Unrest,VTDigger,Community members protest Hannaford grocery chain over migrant labor conditions,"On November 15, 2025, farmworkers and immigrant rights advocates protested at Hannaford supermarkets across Vermont, including Morrisville, demanding the chain join Migrant Justice's Milk with Dignity program to improve dairy worker labor conditions. The demonstration marked the second in just over a year and followed Migrant Justice's April complaint to the OECD alleging grave human rights violations in Hannaford's supply chain. Government and policy responses included Hannaford commissioning an independent human rights investigation and local law enforcement—Morristown Police Department and Lamoille County Sheriff's Department—monitoring the protest and questioning parking lot users. The action occurred amid heightened federal immigration enforcement in Vermont, including the detention of a Migrant Justice organizer in June and multiple raids throughout 2025. Protesters distributed flyers, chanted in English and Spanish, and called for a one-day boycott despite personal risks, with one worker stating that fear would mean ""letting them win.""",https://vtdigger.org/2025/11/24/community-members-protest-hannaford-grocery-chain-over-migrant-labor-conditions/
