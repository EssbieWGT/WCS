Governor Tim Walz and Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty warn this exclusion undermines public accountability and fair outcomes. The case tests whether the Supremacy Clause shields federal officers from state prosecution, though historical precedent shows states can charge federal agents for excessive force.

Newsom's $321 billion draft budget projects a $42.3 billion revenue increase to fund a $27 billion spending hike, but skepticism abounds after his administration's 2022 overstatement of revenue by $165 billion created a persistent $20 billion structural deficit. The plan forecasts a $22 billion deficit in 2027-28 despite a $4.5 billion reserve, leading Newsom to cautiously frame it as a placeholder to be revised in May, which politically positions him to oppose tax increases, manage federal cuts, and potentially launch a presidential campaign.",https://calmatters.org/commentary/2026/01/newsoms-budget-revenue-gain-california/

The governor proposes significant education investments, including fully funding universal transitional kindergarten, an additional $1 billion for high-need schools, and over $27,400 per student. These unexpected revenue gains may help avoid program cuts during legislative budget negotiations.

Newsom proposed $7.3 billion in reserve deposits to rebuild the rainy day fund to $21 billion and $11.8 billion toward pension debt, including $3 billion in the next budget. However, lawmakers warn that federal funding cuts could force at least $1.3 billion in additional state spending on Medi-Cal alone, potentially requiring painful cuts to core services like child care and food assistance if the deficit materializes. Senate Budget Chair John Laird cautioned that the AI boom may not last and that the Legislature must address structural deficits now rather than face a $30-37 billion shortfall later. The plan also redirects $1 billion in Proposition 1 mental health funds annually to homelessness housing while omitting dedicated funding for the main homelessness program, drawing criticism from counties.",https://calmatters.org/politics/2026/01/california-newsom-last-state-budget/

Over 100 immigration judges have been fired nationwide, with more than a quarter dismissed in California, creating a 100,000-case backlog. A July 2025 mandatory detention directive has prompted lawyers to increasingly file habeas corpus petitions in federal courts, where judges have systematically rejected the policy, granting relief in 350 of 362 cases.

Connecticut,State Budget,CT Mirror,Advocates: Federal cutbacks could cost CT nearly $1 billion,"Connecticut faces a nearly $1 billion budget shortfall next fiscal year due to federal cuts to health care and nutrition assistance, exceeding the $500 million emergency fund created from last year's $2.5 billion surplus. With the General Assembly required to revise the 2026-27 budget starting February 4 in an election year, policymakers debate whether to raise taxes on wealthy households or redirect approximately $925 million from state savings programs that capture $1.5 billion annually. Governor Lamont opposes tax increases and has allocated $168 million from the emergency fund to social programs, while Republicans favor middle-class tax cuts and oppose any hikes. The state could generate nearly $400 million annually by collecting just 10% of the $3.7 billion in unpaid taxes.

Senate President Pro Tempore Phil Baruth strongly supports the measures, predicting ICE raids in Burlington and Winooski within the year and citing a recent fatal shooting by an immigration agent in Minneapolis.
