Michigan,Public Health,Michigan Advance,"Measles case confirmed in Oakland County, possible exposure site at Commerce Twp. hospital","Oakland County confirmed its second pediatric measles case of 2025, bringing Michigan's total to 30 cases, while the U.S. faces over 1,900 cases—the highest since 1992. DMC Huron Valley-Sinai Hospital was identified as a potential exposure site for individuals present on December 7.

Kennedy Jr.'s historical skepticism about the measles vaccine. In response, some governors like Illinois' J.B. Pritzker have enacted policies allowing state-level vaccine guidance.

Massachusetts,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,CommonWealth Beacon,Guv urges ICE to halt deportation flights out of Hanscom,"Governor Maura Healey demanded in a December 12 letter that ICE cease using Hanscom Field for deportations, alleging the practice intentionally obstructs due process by severing detainees from legal counsel and family.

Healey asserted that most Massachusetts ICE detainees lack criminal convictions, citing a New York Times report that 63% of recent arrests involved no criminal charges.

Wisconsin,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,Wisconsin Examiner,Federal agents testify on first day of Judge Dugan trial,"Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan faces federal trial for allegedly obstructing six FBI, DEA, Border Patrol, and ICE agents attempting to arrest an undocumented immigrant at the courthouse, highlighting conflict between state judicial authority and federal immigration enforcement. The case emerges as the Milwaukee County Courthouse was drafting policy distinguishing administrative warrants (limited to public areas) from judicial warrants, with staff instructed to direct immigration officers to supervisors. Prosecutors claim Dugan orchestrated the individual's escape, while defense argues she followed proper procedure by referring agents to the chief judge. The trial reflects heightened tension following Trump administration deportation operations that targeted courthouse arrests, alarming local judges. The outcome could establish precedent for how state courts interact with federal immigration enforcement and interpret administrative warrant limitations.",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/2025/12/16/federal-agents-testify-on-first-day-of-judge-dugan-trial/
