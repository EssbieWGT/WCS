The share of arrests for immigration violations alone rose to 44% while violent crime convictions dropped below 5%, contradicting the administration's ""worst of the worst"" focus. New Mexico's Democratic governor attempted to ban ICE detention facilities, while Idaho's Republican governor assists ICE through a 287(g) agreement transporting detainees from county jails.

The proposal aims to reduce bureaucracy while allowing smaller agencies to set clearer goals and identify inefficiencies faster.

Alaska,State Budget,Alaska Beacon,"Disasters, dividends and deficit: Alaska governor unveils first-draft state budget","Gov. Dunleavy's $7.75 billion FY2027 budget proposal requires spending over $1.8 billion from the Constitutional Budget Reserve to cover a deficit driven by declining oil revenue forecasts and a proposed $3,800 Permanent Fund dividend costing $2.4 billion. The plan includes supplemental spending for disasters and acknowledges that relying on savings is unsustainable when 60% of revenue comes from the Permanent Fund and 30% from oil. Spending from the reserve requires a difficult three-quarters legislative majority in both chambers, which has blocked similar proposals. The budget maintains flat public school funding with no maintenance money, increases Corrections by 3%, cuts Medicaid, and refills the higher education fund.

Public health officials are urging symptomatic residents to call ahead before medical visits to enable protective measures and stressing the importance of cooperating with contact tracers to contain spread. While 90% of Utahns are vaccinated, transmission is concentrated in undervaccinated communities, leading officials to promote early infant vaccination at six months and report a 30% statewide increase in MMR uptake.

Nebraska,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,Nebraska Examiner,Lawmakers invited to tour state-run ICE jail as group after Cavanaugh complaint,"Democratic State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh was twice denied entry to Nebraska's state-run McCook ICE detention facility, claiming the Pillen administration violated state law allowing legislators access to state facilities at any time. Republican State Sen. Myron Dorn, head of the Legislature's Oversight Committee, has invited all 49 senators to a scheduled group tour on December 15 to address access concerns. The Pillen administration, which converted the former work ethic camp into a federal ICE jail holding up to 300 migrants, interprets the law differently and requires senators to submit federal security forms for entry. Dorn and Republican State Sen. Ben Hansen acknowledge the access question is ambiguous for facilities housing federal detainees and expect legislation to clarify legislative oversight authority.

Specific reductions include $18M in temporary assistance for needy families, $4M for nurse workforce development, $1.4M for mental health services, and $1.6M for Flint water crisis assistance. Democrats condemned the party-line vote as lacking transparency and debate, with leadership accusing Republicans of putting party allegiance over oath of office.

Mississippi,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,Mississippi Today,Some local and state agencies are aiding ICE crackdown,"Mississippi law enforcement agencies are expanding cooperation with ICE through 287(g) agreements, with four sheriff's departments and two state offices (Attorney General and State Auditor) already signed on, while the Department of Public Safety has a pending agreement in Hinds County. These agreements enable local officers to identify immigration violators in jails, serve administrative warrants, and enforce civil immigration law on the streets through three models: jail enforcement, warrant service, and task force. The program has dramatically expanded under the Trump administration, which has revived the task force model and is reimbursing agencies through the ""Big Beautiful Bill Act,"" building what one researcher calls ""an army of deportation officers"" from state and local law enforcement. Mississippi lawmakers have introduced bills to create a fund supporting 287(g) agencies and establish a state immigration enforcement unit, though these failed in committee; the State Auditor now supports legislation to make immigration a state crime despite constitutional questions about federal authority. Additionally, Madison and Hancock counties have long-standing agreements to serve as holding facilities for ICE detainees, most of whom are not charged with crimes, reflecting a broader trend of local jail systems supporting federal immigration detention.",https://mississippitoday.org/2025/12/11/local-and-state-agencies-are-aiding-ice-crackdown/

Louisiana,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,Louisiana Illuminator,ICE arrests are forcing American moms to leave their jobs,"Increased immigration enforcement under the Trump administration has reduced immigrant childcare workers by an estimated 39,000 since January, prompting 77,000 American mothers of preschool-aged children to leave the workforce due to childcare instability. ICE arrests more than tripled between December 2024 and June 2025, from 8,300 to over 29,000, while the administration rescinded ""sensitive location"" protections for daycares and Congress approved $170 billion for enforcement. The crackdown has created a chilling effect, reducing employment among US-born Hispanic childcare workers by 30 percent and pushing many workers into unregulated private household positions as nannies or au pairs. Researchers found these disruptions contradict administration claims that mass deportations would benefit American workers, instead demonstrating that immigrants and US citizens often perform complementary rather than substitutable labor. The study warns that continued ICE hiring and arrests will further harm not only childcare but other immigrant-intensive industries, forcing policymakers to confront significant trade-offs.",https://lailluminator.com/2025/12/11/ice-child-care/
