Vermont,K-12 Education,VTDigger,Adam Bunting: Education funding should be rooted in ‘genuine partnership and collective purpose’,"Republican lawmakers including Gov. Phil Scott criticize Vermont's K-12 education system for high per-pupil spending amid declining outcomes. CVSD's superintendent rebuts these claims, highlighting the district's 96% graduation rate and strong performance metrics like 87% SAT literacy proficiency, while warning that $9 million in budget cuts have eliminated 82 positions. He argues statewide NAEP scores misrepresent district-level achievement and standardized tests are inadequate accountability measures. Student engagement data shows 90% of grades 9-12 feel a sense of belonging, but students with IEPs report feeling less represented in leadership at nearly double the rate of peers. The superintendent calls for transcending political divisiveness and moving toward genuine partnership to address both funding challenges and representation gaps.",https://vtdigger.org/2025/12/11/adam-bunting-education-funding-should-be-rooted-in-genuine-partnership-and-collective-purpose/

New Mexico,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,Source New Mexico,Newly released data shows sharp decline of inmates at New Mexico ICE facility,"The number of ICE detainees at Torrance County Detention Facility in Estancia has declined sharply from 700 in May to approximately 340-250 since the intergovernmental service agreement between ICE and Torrance County expired on October 31. The contract termination ended ICE's $2.5 million monthly payments to private operator CoreCivic, raising county officials' concerns about potential revenue loss, facility closure, and increased costs for transporting local inmates elsewhere. Immigrant advocates warn that without contractual obligations, conditions may deteriorate further at a facility with a documented history of substandard care, while Senator Martin Heinrich has pressed ICE leadership to justify the legal authority for continued detention operations absent a contract. The decline contrasts with increasing detainee populations at New Mexico's other ICE facilities and nationally amid the Trump administration's expanded deportation efforts. County officials seek a new contract to secure guaranteed revenue, while ICE has not responded to inquiries and CoreCivic maintains operations remain unchanged.",https://sourcenm.com/2025/12/10/newly-released-data-shows-sharp-decline-of-inmates-at-new-mexico-ice-facility/
