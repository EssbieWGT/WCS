The facility depends on federal contracts for 70% of its $14 million annual budget, generating $82-$115 per detainee daily.

Mississippi,Protests and Civil Unrest,Mississippi Today,U.S. Supreme Court hears case from Mississippi preacher over city of Brandon’s protest restrictions,"A Mississippi preacher was convicted under a Brandon city ordinance restricting protests to designated areas after demonstrating outside a concert venue with graphic signs and a loudspeaker. The U.S. Supreme Court is weighing whether his no-contest plea bars him from challenging the ordinance under Heck v. Humphrey precedent. The city defends its regulation as content-neutral, aimed at preventing disturbances from insults rather than suppressing speech. The case could set precedent for municipal protest regulations and limit constitutional challenges from convicted protesters.

Kansas,Public Health,Kansas Reflector,Rural Kansas hospital missed out on $2 million in taxpayer funds that went to cities instead,"For nine years, the Kansas Department of Revenue misdirected nearly $2 million in voter-approved sales tax revenue from Morton County Hospital to three cities due to a ballot citation error, severely underfunding the rural facility that struggles with staff recruitment, Medicaid cuts, and thin margins. The Attorney General affirmed the hospital's right to full funding, and monthly payments have since doubled to $36,000. However, a legislative committee refused to order state reimbursement, instead delaying the issue to the 2026 session, leaving the hospital's financial recovery uncertain.",https://kansasreflector.com/2025/12/05/rural-kansas-hospital-missed-out-on-2-million-in-taxpayer-funds-that-went-to-cities-instead/

Connecticut,Public Health,CT Mirror,US vaccine advisers say not all babies need a hepatitis B shot at birth,"A federal vaccine advisory committee appointed by U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. voted to end the universal recommendation that all newborns receive hepatitis B vaccine at birth, restricting it to high-risk infants despite opposition from medical and public health leaders. The policy shift reverses three decades of disease prevention strategy that has significantly reduced pediatric hepatitis B cases and prevented thousands of illnesses, with critics arguing the committee has abandoned evidence-based public health principles. Committee members questioned past vaccine safety data and cited low infection risk for most infants, while public health experts warn the change could increase chronic infection, liver cancer, and cirrhosis rates. The decision reflects a broader move away from population-level disease prevention toward individual risk assessment, with the committee now excluding CDC scientists from presenting safety data and elevating anti-vaccine voices. Acting CDC Director Jim O'Neill will decide whether to adopt the recommendation, which public health advocates have condemned as transforming a once-authoritative scientific body into what they call an ""epidemiological crime scene.""",https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/05/acip-hepatitis-b-shot/
New Mexico,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,Source New Mexico,"Still no contract for NM ICE lockup, as detainees report interrupted access to ‘vital’ tablets","The inter-governmental services agreement for the Torrance County immigrant detention facility expired October 31, 2025, yet ICE continues detaining approximately 550 immigrants without a renewed contract, prompting U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich to demand immediate detainee transfers and question the agency's legal authority. Despite the contract lapse during the federal shutdown and its reopening November 13, Torrance County officials report receiving no updates from ICE or private operator CoreCivic on renewal terms. Detainees have submitted handwritten complaints about persistent poor conditions, specifically citing tablet failures that block access to legal resources, medical care requests, and external communication. CoreCivic maintains it provides safe and humane care and is unaware of significant tablet issues, while ICE has not responded to inquiries from officials or the senator. The situation raises policy concerns about ICE's compliance with its own standard operating procedures requiring detainee removal when contracts expire and ongoing accountability issues at a facility previously recommended for closure by federal inspectors.",https://sourcenm.com/2025/12/05/still-no-contract-for-nm-ice-lockup-as-detainees-report-interrupted-access-to-vital-tablets/
California,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,CalMatters,‘We may be deporting the wrong people’: New poll shows doubts about immigration crackdown,"A new Goodwin Simon Strategic Research poll commissioned by pro‑immigrant groups found broad bipartisan support among California voters for due‑process protections for immigrants with criminal convictions, with 84% of Democrats, 61% of independents and 54% of Republicans agreeing that individuals deserve a hearing before deportation. The survey also revealed that 61% of voters want California’s prison system to stop directly handing immigrants over to ICE, and that state prisons have transferred more than 9,500 people to ICE since 2019. After hearing personal narratives of rehabilitation, support for judicial review increased among Democrats and independents but dropped slightly among Republicans (54% to 51%). The poll reflects waning support for the Trump administration’s expedited‑removal policies and suggests that detailed personal stories can shift public opinion on immigration enforcement. California’s sanctuary law does not cover serious crimes, yet the findings indicate voter appetite for limiting state‑federal cooperation even for those with records.",https://calmatters.org/justice/2025/12/immigration-poll-criminal-record/

Kentucky,State Budget,Kentucky Lantern,"As KY Republicans mull income tax cut, Beshear warns against crashing fiscal guardrails","Kentucky faces a projected $300+ million revenue shortfall for the current fiscal year, with flat revenue growth failing to keep pace with rising costs, including a new $180 million state burden for SNAP administration. The Consensus Forecasting Group attributes the shortfall partly to decreased income tax revenue from rate cuts that have already reduced the rate from 5% to 3.5%. Governor Beshear warns that costs are rising significantly faster than revenues, potentially straining state services, while Republican lawmakers debate further income tax cuts for 2026 despite missing fiscal triggers established in 2022 law. The triggers were designed to prevent a budget crisis by ensuring revenue adequacy before each rate reduction. This creates a political conflict over whether to adhere to the guardrails or proceed with cuts that could worsen the structural deficit.",https://kentuckylantern.com/2025/12/04/as-ky-republicans-mull-income-tax-cut-beshear-warns-against-crashing-fiscal-guardrails/

Vermont,Public Health,VTDigger,Brattleboro hospital projects $14.5M shortfall in current budget,"Brattleboro Memorial Hospital, the main healthcare provider for 55,000 people in southeastern Vermont, projects a $14.5 million operating loss for its current budget, prompting state regulators at Vermont's Green Mountain Care Board to order a recalculation under a new law that allows state intervention. The 61-bed facility has implemented a hiring freeze, dismissed six administrators, and is led by two acting co-CEOs who are physicians—orthopaedic surgeon Elizabeth McLarney and primary care physician Tony Blofson—after its previous CEO departed. The hospital attributes losses to unpaid patient bills, rising staff health insurance costs, and $5 million in reductions from federal and state pharmaceutical price and payment changes. Regulators have confirmed the $14.5 million projection as ""an accurate representation"" while the facility seeks new leadership and outside financial consulting. This financial instability threatens patient access to care in a region where the hospital is one of the largest employers and sole major provider.",https://vtdigger.org/2025/12/04/brattleboro-hospital-projects-14-5m-shortfall-in-current-budget/
