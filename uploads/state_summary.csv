California,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,CalMatters,ICE ignores hard lessons LAPD learned after Rodney King beating,"An ICE agent fatally shot Renee Good in Minneapolis during an enforcement action, employing tactics that violated established de-escalation principles by drawing his weapon prematurely and shooting into her vehicle as she attempted to leave. Federal officials including Vice President Vance and advisor Stephen Miller immediately claimed the agent had ""absolute immunity,"" a position the article critiques as legally false and undermining accountability. The article highlights that while federal prosecution may be blocked by administration officials, the agent remains liable for potential state murder charges, which have no statute of limitations. It contrasts ICE's approach with successful LAPD reforms, arguing federal immigration authorities are deliberately ignoring lessons on use-of-force policies and civilian oversight. The piece warns this rejection of accountability measures could lead to civil unrest similar to 1990s Los Angeles.",https://calmatters.org/commentary/2026/01/ice-hard-lessons-lapd/

Ernie Yarbrough, would expand state immigration enforcement by allowing local law enforcement agencies to enter agreements with federal authorities like DHS, a power currently limited to the Attorney General. The legislation requires officers to determine immigration status during arrests, share that information with federal agencies, and transfer custody of individuals lacking proper documentation. During a House Judiciary Committee hearing, critics—including immigrant rights advocates and clergy—warned the bill could lead to constitutional violations, racial profiling, and heightened community fear due to vague ""probable cause"" standards and officer immunity provisions.
