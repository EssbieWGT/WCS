The legislation specifically targets paid political influencers and protesters, with the bill's author acknowledging that people are likely paid to protest at the Statehouse. First Amendment advocates, including the ACLU of Indiana and League of Women Voters, warn the bill could chill political association and participation. The Indiana Lobby Registration Commission, which would enforce the law, raised concerns about separation of powers and insufficient staffing to handle the anticipated reporting burden.

Minnesota,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,Minnesota Reformer,In the car with the Minneapolis community patrols working to disrupt ICE operations,"The Trump administration has deployed thousands of ICE agents to Minnesota under ""Operation Metro Surge,"" prompting formation of community rapid response networks that legally monitor and distract agents to prevent arrests. These decentralized patrols follow ICE vehicles, document activities, and share intelligence, but have escalated into confrontations with agents using intimidation tactics like blocking cars, threatening arrest, and visiting observers' homes. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem characterized the fatal shooting of observer Renee Good by an ICE agent as ""domestic terrorism"" while announcing investigations into nonprofit funding of anti-ICE operations. State regulators have warned ICE against switching license plates to evade detection, and the ACLU has sued over agents' alleged harassment of monitors.

Proposition 25 fundamentally altered the budget process by enabling simple-majority ""trailer bills"" that now carry non-budget policies negotiated in secret, which Newsom has exploited extensively.

Kentucky,Public Health,Kentucky Lantern,CDC just sidelined these childhood vaccines. Here’s what they prevent.,"The HHS and CDC have significantly reduced routine childhood vaccine recommendations for diseases including hepatitis A/B, rotavirus, RSV, meningococcal disease, flu, and covid, shifting to ""shared clinical decision-making"" for high-risk children only while maintaining insurance coverage. Healthcare providers and disease experts strongly oppose the change, warning it will confuse parents, reduce vaccination rates, and could lead to disease outbreaks, noting sidelined vaccines have prevented nearly 2 million hospitalizations and 90,000 deaths over 30 years. HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an anti-vaccine activist, cited other nations' schedules as justification, though experts counter most European countries align more closely with previous U.S. standards.

Wisconsin,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,Wisconsin Examiner,‘This is way too big’: Wisconsinites respond to the ICE shooting in Minnesota,"The killing of Renee Good by an ICE agent in Minneapolis has intensified scrutiny of the Trump administration's immigration enforcement policies, which have allocated over $170 billion to ICE through the One Big Beautiful Bill Act—exceeding the combined budgets of all local and state law enforcement. The administration's directives, including Attorney General Pam Bondi's ""Ending Political Violence Against ICE,"" broadly justify targeting Americans who protest immigration policies or assist immigrants, while federal officials have claimed ""total immunity"" for agents. Since the crackdown began, ICE has been involved in 16 shootings, four fatal, amid a climate where officials immediately blamed Good for her death and labeled her a ""domestic terrorist."" The article highlights a dangerous shift toward political violence, with poorly trained agents operating with minimal accountability and rhetoric that stokes division. Wisconsin community leaders and activists are calling for Congress to roll back ICE funding and for state officials to condemn the violence, emphasizing that the Midwest is not insulated from these enforcement actions.",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/2026/01/12/this-is-way-too-big-wisconsinites-respond-to-the-ice-shooting-in-minnesota/
