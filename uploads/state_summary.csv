Kentucky,Public Health,Kentucky Lantern,"Whooping cough makes a comeback, but the vaccine provides powerful protection","Kentucky is experiencing its largest whooping cough (pertussis) spike since 2012, with three unvaccinated infants dying in the past 12 months, prompting state health officials to confirm that none of the deceased infants or their mothers had been vaccinated. State vaccination data shows kindergartener pertussis immunization rates dropped from 95% (2019-20) to 92% (2023-24), amid rising anti-vaccine sentiment and cuts to immunization services. Public health officials recommend maternal vaccination at 27-36 weeks pregnancy and routine childhood boosters to protect infants too young for vaccination. The outbreak reflects a national trend, with 20,939 U.S. cases reported by November 2025, significantly higher than pre-pandemic levels.",https://kentuckylantern.com/2025/11/29/whooping-cough-makes-a-comeback-but-the-vaccine-provides-powerful-protection/
