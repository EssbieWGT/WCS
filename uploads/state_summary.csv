Minnesota,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,Minnesota Reformer,Federal judge tells ICE to cool it,"Federal Judge Kate Menendez granted a preliminary injunction preventing DHS and ICE from retaliating against peaceful protesters observing immigration enforcement in Minnesota, including during ""Operation Metro Surge."" The ruling prohibits federal agents from arresting or detaining peaceful demonstrators and bans use of pepper spray and other nonlethal munitions against them. It also restricts vehicle stops, requiring ""reasonable, articulable suspicion"" and explicitly protects the practice of following and tracking suspected ICE vehicles. The ACLU lawsuit was filed on behalf of six plaintiffs who were monitoring ICE raids in the state's Somali community, including Susan Tincher, who was detained for five hours, shackled, and had her belongings confiscated after asking agents if they were ICE. The decision represents a significant legal check on federal immigration enforcement operations in the state.",https://minnesotareformer.com/2026/01/16/federal-judge-tells-ice-to-cool-it/

Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey for allegedly impeding federal immigration enforcement through public criticism, amid an ICE surge of 3,000 agents in the state. The Trump administration is auditing Hennepin Healthcare for immigrant employment compliance and investigating Minnesota's social programs for fraud, while freezing child care payments and small business grants. A federal court blocked attempted SNAP funding cuts, but Trump has threatened to withhold all federal funding from sanctuary states beginning February 1.

Kansas,Protests and Civil Unrest,Kansas Reflector,"At Statehouse human rights protest, Kansans brandish outrage at ICE killing and political cowardice","On January 14, 2026, hundreds of Kansans rallied at the Topeka Statehouse for a ""human needs are human rights"" protest organized by civic groups to oppose the Trump administration's deployment of ICE agents against immigrants and protesters. The demonstration was sparked by the death of Minneapolis mother Renee Good and featured signs directly challenging Kansas legislators Moran, Marshall, and Estes to defend democracy and due process. Protesters labeled ICE as ""Trump's Gestapo,"" demanded the agency's abolition, and condemned what they termed the ""nazification of America."" The rally occurred amid ongoing ICE raids and after a government shutdown that had weakened the administration's political standing.

Maine,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,Maine Morning Star,Maine organizers have long been preparing for ICE to arrive,"Maine community groups have trained over 300 residents through an ICE watch hotline launched in October to monitor enforcement activity, as mayors of the state's two largest cities announced expectations of increased federal immigration presence despite DHS neither confirming nor denying plans and Gov. Mills being unable to obtain confirmation; the organizing includes a solidarity fund for legal representation, school watch programs after a September parent detention, and a political campaign by a Cumberland County commissioner candidate to terminate the county jail's ICE detention contract, while fear has caused student absences and prompted cultural organizations to review safety protocols.",https://mainemorningstar.com/2026/01/17/maine-organizers-have-long-been-preparing-for-ice-to-arrive/
Idaho,State Budget,Idaho Capital Sun,Legislative notebook: State budget dominates first week of Idaho’s 2026 legislative session,"Idaho faces projected budget deficits of $40.3 million for FY2026 and $555.2 million for FY2027, with Governor Brad Little proposing Medicaid cuts of about $45 million but not repealing Medicaid expansion. Republicans, including House Speaker Mike Moyle, dismiss the deficit as ""not a big deal,"" while Democrats and health care advocates blame $450 million in recent tax cuts and warn of harm to essential services. The Economic Outlook and Revenue Assessment Committee recommended a $5.8 billion revenue projection—$137 million higher than the governor's estimate—but the Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee delayed discussion. Governor Little asserts the state remains fiscally sound and will use spending reductions and operational efficiencies to right-size government. Legislative leaders aim to set the revenue projection early, contrasting with last year's late timing which drew criticism.",https://idahocapitalsun.com/2026/01/17/legislative-notebook-state-budget-dominates-first-week-of-idahos-2026-legislative-session/
Wyoming,Public Health,WyoFile,Gillette clinic lays off around 40 people,"The Hoskinson Health Wellness Clinic in Gillette announced approximately 40 layoffs while maintaining service for 20,000 patients, citing declining reimbursements, escalating costs, and payer mix challenges. This reduction exacerbates Wyoming's rural healthcare crisis, where hospital service closures and Congress's failure to extend ACA tax subsidies have created the nation's highest premium increases. State health officials warn the staffing cuts will lengthen wait times, limit care options, and strain emergency services, reflecting systemic workforce shortages and financial pressures that threaten accessible healthcare in rural and frontier communities.",https://wyofile.com/gillette-clinic-eliminates-around-40-positions/

The state plans to establish six NC ROOTS hubs integrating medical, mental health, and social services, plus invest in prevention, maternal health, workforce development, and technology. Governor Josh Stein warned that the same legislation will cost the state tens of billions in Medicaid funds over the next decade, disproportionately harming rural communities despite this funding.

Michigan,State Budget,Michigan Advance,State budget pressures rise as Michigan projects slower revenue growth through FY28,"Michigan's January 2025 revenue forecast lowered FY26 and FY27 projections by $780 million and $1.1 billion respectively, intensifying budget pressures from federal policy shifts. House Republicans claim this creates a $1 billion+ deficit, justifying their ""waste, fraud, and abuse"" cuts and criticism that Democrats squandered a $9 billion surplus. Democratic budget officials, including Director Jen Flood, assert the changes were anticipated and already incorporated into FY26 planning, noting Michigan continues building its rainy-day fund while aiming for a June balanced budget. The approved forecast shows modest 0.2% growth for FY26, 1.1% for FY27, and 2.4% for FY28 in combined funds. This divergence highlights a partisan split on fiscal strategy: preemptive cuts versus disciplined investment to maintain state financial health.",https://michiganadvance.com/2026/01/16/state-budget-pressures-rise-as-michigan-projects-slower-revenue-growth-through-fy28/
