Wyoming,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,WyoFile,"From a Casper jail to an unknown land, a Cuban man’s deportation saga continues","The Trump administration's third-country deportation policy, upheld by the Supreme Court's shadow docket, led ICE to deport Cuban immigrant Josue Rodriguez Perez to Mexico despite his valid U.S. work permit and legal residency since 1993; his 2012 felony conviction ruptured his residency status, resulting in months of detention across multiple facilities including Natrona County jail before his September deportation to a nation with no ties, separating him from his family and ending his trucking career while raising human rights concerns about due process denial.",https://wyofile.com/from-a-casper-jail-to-an-unknown-land-a-cuban-mans-deportation-saga-continues/

Tennessee,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,Tennessee Lookout,"Christian Singers Caught In Deportation Net, One Branded ‘Worst of Worst’","The Trump administration's Memphis Safe Task Force arrested Guatemalan brothers Delmar and Eber Gomez on immigration charges, deporting Eber despite no criminal record while Delmar remains detained facing deportation despite only minor traffic violations. The Department of Homeland Security published false information labeling Delmar Gomez as a ""worst of the worst"" criminal and misidentifying him as ""Miguel Torres,"" a Mexican drug dealer, while making unverifiable claims about other arrested immigrants. These arrests exemplify the administration's mass deportation campaign that has resulted in 74% of ICE detainees nationwide having no criminal convictions, with immigration arrests comprising 20% of the Memphis task force's total apprehensions. Delmar Gomez, a father of four U.S. citizen children and prominent Pentecostal worship singer, faces an immigration judge Tuesday seeking cancellation of removal based on his 20-year U.S. residency and family ties. The administration's dissemination of false information and detention of immigrants with minor or no criminal records reflects a broader policy pattern of portraying immigrants as dangerous while denying bond and pressuring detainees to accept deportation.",https://tennesseelookout.com/2025/11/25/christian-singers-caught-in-deportation-net-one-branded-worst-of-worst/

Tax cuts have reduced state revenue by $4 billion since 2021, while federal legislation may cut another $284.4 million annually. Gov.

Idaho,State Budget,Idaho Capital Sun,New report shows 5 years of Idaho income tax cuts have reduced state revenue by $4 billion,"Idaho's state budget faces a projected $58.3 million deficit for FY 2026 amid 3% budget holdbacks and revenue shortfalls, following five income tax cuts since 2021 that reduced state revenue by $4 billion. The Idaho Constitution mandates a balanced budget, and these revenue reductions limit funding for core public services including education, transportation, and public safety. House Speaker Mike Moyle championed the tax cuts as ""returning the people's money,"" while Governor Brad Little expressed concerns about the revenue impact despite supporting the cuts. The tax cuts disproportionately benefited the top 1% of earners, who received average annual savings of $20,407, while the bottom 20% saved only $33 annually. Budget analysts warn that cuts during economic hardship have long-lasting effects, with Idaho's per-pupil funding still lagging behind pre-2001 recession levels when adjusted for inflation.",https://idahocapitalsun.com/2025/11/24/new-report-shows-5-years-of-idaho-income-tax-cuts-have-reduced-state-revenue-by-4-billion/

Louisiana,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,Louisiana Illuminator,"Louisiana, where parole is nearly impossible, is releasing prisoners to deport them","Louisiana's Republican-led government has implemented an expedited deportation process through a special parole panel that unanimously paroles immigrant prisoners directly into ICE custody for deportation, contrasting sharply with Gov. Jeff Landry's restrictive parole policies for U.S. citizens that have reduced annual parole rates to under 25%; the policy, enacted via legislation and Landry's ""Operation Geaux"" executive order granting state agencies ICE authority, has identified approximately 390 eligible prisoners and resulted in at least nine paroles in August, with two deportations and two detainees held at the newly opened Louisiana Lockup facility at Angola prison, representing a politically motivated two-tiered justice system that prioritizes mass deportation over the stringent public safety criteria applied to citizen prisoners.",https://lailluminator.com/2025/11/24/louisiana-deport-parole/

Missouri,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,Missouri Independent,Afghan asylum seeker who fought the Taliban now held by ICE in Missouri,"Afghan asylum seeker Mohammad Ali Dadfar has been detained at Greene County Jail since October, with his Kansas City attorney filing a federal lawsuit challenging his warrantless arrest as a violation of the 2022 Castañon Nava consent decree governing ICE enforcement across six states including Missouri. The case highlights ongoing legal battles over Trump administration immigration practices, particularly Operations Midway Blitz and Guardian, which have resulted in hundreds of warrantless arrests of immigrants—97% of whom had no criminal record, contradicting administration claims of targeting ""the worst of the worst."" The lawsuit names Greene County Sheriff Jim C. Arnott, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, and ICE Chicago Field Office Director Samuel Olson as defendants. Despite having valid work authorization and a pending asylum hearing scheduled for February 2026, Dadfar—who assisted U.S. forces against the Taliban—faces deportation. The litigation seeks to prevent his transfer from ICE's Kansas City jurisdiction and enforce the consent decree's protections against unlawful detention.",https://missouriindependent.com/2025/11/24/afghan-asylum-seeker-who-fought-the-taliban-now-held-by-ice-in-missouri/
