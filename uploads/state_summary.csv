Indiana,State Budget,Indiana Capital Chronicle,"Indiana hospitals warn of cuts, closures without lawmaker intervention","Indiana hospital leaders are calling for state budget action to address a financial crisis, with operating margins dropping to 1.9% and 40% of hospitals operating in the red, particularly rural facilities. Hospital officials are specifically pushing for higher Medicaid reimbursement rates and greater accountability from insurers, as Medicaid patients represent 20% of cases but reimburse below cost. The crisis is forcing service cuts like Greene County General Hospital's obstetrics unit closure after 100 years, and leaders warn more closures will follow without state intervention. State legislators are being urged to address these issues based on accurate financial data rather than incomplete claims that hospitals are financially stable. The situation may require state budget allocations to support safety net hospitals facing rising uncompensated care as uninsured rates are projected to increase from 8% to 10% by 2030.",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/2026/01/28/indiana-hospitals-warn-of-cuts-closures-without-lawmaker-intervention/
