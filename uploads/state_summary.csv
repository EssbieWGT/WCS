Idaho,State Budget,Idaho Capital Sun,Idaho state employees likely not to see raise amid increasing health care costs,"Idaho faces a $600 million to $1 billion budget shortfall for fiscal year 2027, prompting Governor Brad Little to propose a budget with no salary increases for 25,000 state employees despite a 15% market lag and 14.6% turnover rate. The fiscal constraint has led the Change in Employee Compensation Committee to consider not meeting this year, while the Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee prepares to set ""maintenance budgets"" on January 23. State employees will also absorb a 7.3% increase in out-of-pocket health insurance costs, ranging from $29 to $654 annually. House Speaker Mike Moyle indicated employee raises may be ""off the table,"" though the governor's budget book states compensation could be prioritized if revenue projections improve.

Ohio,Public Health,Ohio Capital Journal,"Federal funds for rural health on the way to Ohio, but not enough to offset cuts, advocates say","Ohio received $202 million through the Rural Health Transformation Program to combat rural hospital closures and healthcare access gaps, but this represents a small fraction of the $33 billion in Medicaid cuts the state faces over the next decade from the same federal legislation. The program, authorized under Trump's 2025 tax and spending cut package, targets critical public health challenges including chronic disease management, infant mortality, and specialty care access across 57 rural hospitals. However, federal rules restrict direct facility payments to just 15% of funds, limiting sustainable support for hospitals already operating at financial losses. State leaders acknowledge the funding is appreciated but insufficient to stop the ""bleeding"" caused by broader cuts, with 10 additional rural hospitals at risk of closure.

Connecticut,Protests and Civil Unrest,CT Mirror,Between the torch and the street in Minneapolis,"A Connecticut writer relates the shooting of Renee Good in Minneapolis to protests and civil unrest by framing her intervention—with a whistle to protect people from a federal operation—as civil resistance akin to historical protests. The article critiques the ""compliance"" narrative used to justify state violence against citizens who position themselves between power and the vulnerable, arguing this narrative criminalizes protest and maintains state monopoly on force. It demonstrates how legal and procedural frameworks convert moral acts of resistance into technical violations, erasing their political character. The piece argues that when the state threatens those it should protect, citizen intervention becomes necessary protest, yet systems consistently punish such challenges. This analysis underscores tensions between state authority and the right to protest when citizens directly confront government operations.",https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/14/between-the-torch-and-the-street-in-minneapolis/

Senate President Ferguson ruled out new revenues, indicating the state will pursue cost-containment measures and adjust program formulas to moderate growth. The budget crisis is exacerbated by $400 million in entitlement spending for just 700 high-need individuals with developmental disabilities, which Ferguson warns will crowd out other priorities.
