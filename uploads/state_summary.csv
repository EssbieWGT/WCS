The Legislative Fiscal Analyst office recommended specific cuts including reducing equal opportunity initiatives funding, rescinding previously approved engineering and computer science initiative funds, and cutting 60% of out-of-state tuition waivers. House Speaker Mike Schultz indicated that while a full 5% cut may not occur, the legislature will examine budget reallocation in the coming weeks. Gov.

Idaho,Protests and Civil Unrest,Idaho Capital Sun,"Bill introduced to allow ISP to ban people from Idaho Capitol, Supreme Court buildings","Idaho Rep. Bruce Skaug introduced a bill banning overnight camping and ""symbolic"" tents on state property, a direct policy response to a 2022 homelessness protest encampment near the Capitol. The legislation empowers directors of the Department of Administration or Idaho State Police to ban individuals from Capitol and Supreme Court buildings for one year at their ""sole discretion"" if they disrupt government business or threaten safety. Violators would face criminal trespass charges, and unattended items could be seized and held for 90 days with storage fees. The bill, which passed its introductory committee vote without discussion, represents a significant expansion of state authority to restrict protest activities on public property. It follows previous legal action by Gov. Brad Little and the attorney general to remove the 2022 protesters and a 2025 law criminalizing sleeping outside in large cities.",https://idahocapitalsun.com/2026/01/23/bill-introduced-to-allow-isp-to-ban-people-from-idaho-capitol-supreme-court-buildings/

New Mexico,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,Source New Mexico,NM GOP senator asks feds to intervene and help stop immigration detention ban,"Republican Sen. James Townsend has asked the U.S. Department of Justice to intervene against New Mexico's House Bill 9, which would prohibit public entities from contracting with ICE for immigrant detention, citing constitutional concerns from a recent Third Circuit ruling that struck down New Jersey's ban on private ICE contracts. ACLU attorneys defending the bill argue it differs by only restricting public entity cooperation, not direct private contracts, and would not prevent ICE from contracting directly with companies like CoreCivic. The legislation would terminate existing intergovernmental agreements in three counties, though county officials anticipate ICE may circumvent the ban through direct private contracting. The House Consumer and Public Affairs Committee advanced the measure Thursday, with Democratic leadership expecting swift passage to the governor.",https://sourcenm.com/2026/01/23/nm-gop-senator-asks-feds-to-intervene-and-help-stop-immigration-detention-ban/

DeSantis's directive to lower flags for a deceased Army sergeant and correctional officer demonstrates how government memorial policies shape political narratives around military service. Such state-led ceremonial gestures can contextualize or respond to potential public demonstrations about defense policies, veteran support systems, or public sector employment conditions. While no protests are mentioned in the article, official actions like this influence the political environment for civic discourse. This illustrates how government responses to individual loss may intersect with broader public debates about military deployment and corrections work.

The hospital serves five counties, and its shutdown would force residents to travel 45 minutes or more for medical care.

Supporters argue the program would boost academic performance and reduce family financial strain, while opponents label it socialism and advocate for alternative spending like property tax credits. The legislative failure transfers policy authority from lawmakers to voters, potentially creating a constitutionally mandated entitlement that would constrain future legislative budget flexibility. Senator Mark Enget (R-Powers Lake) stated that a ballot measure would allow voters to directly assume financial responsibility for any resulting tax increases needed to fund the program.",https://northdakotamonitor.com/2026/01/23/north-dakota-senate-narrowly-defeats-free-school-meal-bill/
