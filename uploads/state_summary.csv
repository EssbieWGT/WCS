New Hampshire,K-12 Education,New Hampshire Bulletin,"Objecting to ConVal decision, House Republicans vote down school funding bill","After the New Hampshire Supreme Court’s ConVal decision declared the state’s school funding unconstitutional, Democrats proposed HB 651 to raise the base per‑pupil grant from $4,266 to the court‑specified $7,356.01 and boost differentiated aid for disadvantaged students, but Republicans rejected it, disputing the court’s authority and urging districts to trim administrative costs. Republicans countered with HB 121, requiring annual audits and allowing the State Board of Education to place financially mismanaged districts on probation and potentially install outside administrators, and HB 675, which would limit annual budget increases to inflation unless a two‑thirds voter majority overrides. GOP leaders argue these bills impose needed fiscal discipline as enrollment declines, while Democrats warn they erode local control and ignore the constitutional mandate to fund schools adequately.
