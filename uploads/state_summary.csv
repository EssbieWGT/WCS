Idaho,State Budget,Idaho Capital Sun,Idaho state agencies told to submit plans for more budget cuts,"Idaho agency directors must submit plans by Friday for additional 1-2% budget cuts for FY 2026-2027, potentially reaching 5% total, due to uncertainty over House Bill 519's $155 million federal tax conformity impact.

Barry Usher oppose it, asserting ICE operations are lawful and that the state cannot enforce such restrictions on federal authorities. Boldman plans to use the months before the 2027 legislative session to build support among faith groups, law enforcement, and libertarian‑leaning legislators.

Oklahoma,K-12 Education,Oklahoma Voice,Oklahoma schools chief requests $4 billion for education but hints at need for more,"State Superintendent Lindel Fields requested a $4 billion K-12 budget for FY2027, a $23 million increase for educators' health insurance, while prioritizing first-year teacher salary increases, literacy improvement, and school security without specifying costs. Oklahoma ranks near the bottom in per-pupil spending and behind neighboring states in first-year teacher pay at $41,152.

Chad Caldwell, raised concerns that about half of Oklahoma's $12,000 per-pupil spending goes to non-instructional expenses, though state classifications include technology, curriculum development, and counselors in that category. Several legislators have filed bills aligned with these priorities, including continued school security funding, principal training frameworks, and teacher salary increases.",https://oklahomavoice.com/briefs/oklahoma-schools-chief-requests-4-billion-for-education-but-hints-at-need-for-more/
