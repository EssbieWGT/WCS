Alabama,K-12 Education,Alabama Reflector,Alabama State Board of Education could vote on new textbooks in February,"The Alabama State Board of Education delayed its November vote on adopting new social studies and arts textbooks after board members raised concerns about insufficient review time and whether the materials reflect ""the values of Alabamians."" State Superintendent Eric Mackey announced he has developed a new proposal that could be presented as early as February, pending approval from board leadership. If the board ultimately adopts the textbooks, they would be implemented for the 2026-2027 school year. The delay underscores political tensions over curriculum content at the state level. The adoption process involved two committees appointed in April to review and rate textbooks before sealed ratings were provided to the board in October.",https://alabamareflector.com/2026/01/09/alabama-state-board-of-education-could-vote-on-new-textbooks-in-february/
Indiana,State Budget,Indiana Capital Chronicle,Revenue shift means more money. Will lawmakers spend it?,"Indiana's December 2025 revenue forecast reversed April's $2 billion shortfall projection, creating a surprise surplus expected to reach nearly $5 billion by mid-2027 (22% of annual spending, well above the typical 10-15% target). Senate Republicans oppose new spending, arguing revenue must materialize first, while Democrats push to restore cuts to child care vouchers (with 32,000+ children waitlisted) and state employee compensation. The budget signed in May 2025 had already forced Gov. Mike Braun to cut agency budgets, lay off workers, and reduce social services based on the earlier forecast. State Budget Director Chad Ranney and House Speaker Todd Huston advocate a wait-and-see approach given federal economic uncertainty. Republicans must choose between activating Indiana's automatic taxpayer refund or reinvesting in slashed programs while preserving the state's AAA credit rating.",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/2026/01/09/revenue-shift-means-more-money-will-lawmakers-spend-it/

Casey Toof helped shape as assistant minority leader, could potentially generate public demonstrations as key provisions remain unresolved. Toof's resignation from the House Education Committee, along with three other members since June, may create legislative instability that sparks organized opposition to the law's implementation.
