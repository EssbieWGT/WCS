Massachusetts,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,CommonWealth Beacon,What ICE is doing is abhorrent. But here’s why canceling the state contract to house its detainees might not be the right thing to do.,"Massachusetts anticipates $25 million in ICE revenue for detaining people at Plymouth County Correctional Facility, sparking debate over whether to cancel the contract. Canceling could hinder ICE but might transfer detainees to distant, harsher prisons far from family and lawyers. Former state official John Grossman proposes retaining the contract while redirecting all ICE funds to immigrant legal defense (increasing it 500%) or refugee services (more than doubling it). This policy would align state actions with professed immigrant protection values by using ICE revenue to counteract the agency's harm. The aim is for Massachusetts to become a national model for mitigating ICE's inhumane practices through strategic fiscal redirection.",https://commonwealthbeacon.org/opinion/what-ice-is-doing-is-abhorrent-heres-why-the-case-for-canceling-the-state-contract-to-house-its-detainees-isnt-as-simple-as-it-might-seem/
