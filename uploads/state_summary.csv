Maryland,Public Health,Maryland Matters,Lawmakers call for the release of LIHEAP funds as health officials announce first cold-related death,"Maryland health officials recorded the state's first cold-related death of the season, a man in Frederick County, as federal LIHEAP heating assistance funds remain frozen.

Fear of immigration enforcement further suppresses vaccination rates in Hispanic communities, while post-pandemic funding cuts have reduced public health outreach and slowed immunization registry reporting from daily to monthly.
