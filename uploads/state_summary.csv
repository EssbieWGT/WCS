Alaska,State Budget,Alaska Beacon,"Alaska revenue forecast predicts more oil, but its importance to the state budget is declining","Alaska's FY2027 revenue forecast projects $6.2 billion in unrestricted general fund revenue, a $260 million increase, but Gov. Dunleavy's proposed budget faces a $1.8 billion deficit. Oil revenue will account for only 23% of income despite rising production, while the Permanent Fund transfer provides 66%, fundamentally shifting budget sustainability from petroleum to investment earnings that cannot feasibly cover the shortfall.",https://alaskabeacon.com/2025/12/15/alaska-revenue-forecast-predicts-more-oil-but-its-importance-to-the-state-budget-is-declining/

Washington,State Budget,Washington State Standard,Maneuver to shore up WA’s transportation budget could be reversed,"Washington's operating budget shortfall may force lawmakers to cancel a planned 0.1% sales tax transfer to transportation before it begins in the next biennium, jeopardizing roughly $300 million in annual revenue that House Transportation Chair Jake Fey calls essential for sustaining megaprojects and meeting court-ordered culvert removal deadlines; the potential reversal, confirmed as ""on the table"" by House budget writer Rep.

Indiana,K-12 Education,Indiana Capital Chronicle,Strong schools build strong communities: Indiana’s funding system should reflect that,"Indiana's K-12 funding uses state per-student dollars for teacher salaries, creating enrollment-based ""spiral"" effects, while Senate Enrolled Act 1's 2025 reforms cut local property tax revenue for operations and require sharing with charter schools. This forces districts to compete for students via visible athletic facility upgrades despite overall resource decline. The system contributes to workforce challenges: fewer students attend college, brain drain accelerates, and high-wage employers leave the state, indicating a need for policy prioritization of public education.",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/2025/12/15/strong-schools-build-strong-communities-indianas-funding-system-should-reflect-that/

North Dakota,State Budget,North Dakota Monitor,Budget shortfall will reduce North Dakota child care assistance for some families,"North Dakota's child care assistance program faces a $35.5 million budget deficit for the 2025-2027 biennium, requiring $160.2 million instead of the allocated $124.7 million due to enrollment exceeding projections (7,600 vs. 6,400 children monthly). To address the shortfall, the Department of Health and Human Services is reducing subsidies for children over age 3, closing enrollment to new families with a waitlist, and scaling back incentive bonuses for the Bright & Early ND quality program. The state will also allocate $22.3 million from federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families grants to cover the remaining gap. Lawmakers including Sen. Kathy Hogan have expressed concern that these cuts will worsen the state's child care crisis, potentially impacting workforce retention. The issue may be addressed during the Legislature's planned January special session, as the program serves as a critical economic development tool to combat North Dakota's severe labor shortage.",https://northdakotamonitor.com/2025/12/15/budget-shortfall-will-reduce-north-dakota-child-care-assistance-for-some-families/
