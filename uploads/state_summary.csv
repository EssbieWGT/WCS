California,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,CalMatters,Harrowing experiences at the hands of ICE unify a diverse L.A. audience,"A House Oversight and Reform Committee hearing in Los Angeles examined Trump Administration ICE raids that detained long-term residents and U.S. citizens like Andrea Velez, a 4'11"" American citizen held for two days without access to lawyers or adequate food. Witnesses described 98-day detentions in Adelanto with rotten food, medical neglect, and sexual assault, while a U.S. citizen tamale vendor injured by ICE has remained indoors for 158 days due to fear. The raids have caused measurable community harm: decreased school attendance, empty church pews, struggling youth programs, and business losses. Mayor Karen Bass and Rep. Robert Garcia, who presided, stated the cruelty was intentional, while Japanese-American speakers drew parallels to 1942 internment camps under the same legal authority. Rep. Maxine Waters received loud audience support for denouncing Trump's policies as having ""terrorized"" immigrant communities while paradoxically uniting Los Angeles residents across racial lines.",https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/11/ice-experiences-unify-los-angeles/
California,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,CalMatters,He fled religious persecution in Turkey. Then he got a one-day notice for an ICE check-in,"A Turkish asylum seeker with a valid work permit was arrested at a routine San Diego immigration check-in, reflecting a broader Trump administration policy shift that lifted Biden-era protections against arrests at sensitive locations. The change has enabled ICE to detain hundreds across California at scheduled appointments, creating a legal catch-22 where immigrants risk arrest by complying or face deportation orders if they don't appear. Demirtas, who fled religious persecution, is held at the overcrowded Otay Mesa Detention Center, which has exceeded its contractual capacity amid record national detention levels exceeding 65,000. Advocates and U.S. Senator Alex Padilla argue these check-in arrests violate due process by punishing compliance with immigration procedures. The policy expansion now targets nationals from countries like Turkey that previously faced limited deportations, signaling heightened enforcement against asylum seekers legally present in the U.S.",https://calmatters.org/justice/2025/11/san-diego-immigration-arrest/
Virginia,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,Virginia Mercury,"Va. assistant principal, brother arrested in alleged plot to kill ICE agents, police officers","DHS arrested Virginia brothers John and Mark Bennett for allegedly plotting violent attacks on ICE agents, with Mark Bennett detained at Norfolk International Airport before a flight to Las Vegas to acquire firearms with explosive rounds. Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin emphasized the severity of the allegations, noting John Bennett's position as a Kempsville High School assistant principal since 2009. DHS cited an 8,000% increase in death threats and 1,150% rise in assaults against ICE employees in recent years. The brothers face Virginia state charges of conspiracy to commit malicious wounding, with no disclosed ties to organized extremist groups. The case mirrors a July 4 attack on a Texas ICE detention facility and aligns with broader trends of increased threats against federal agents documented by the Brennan Center for Justice.",https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/va-assistant-principal-brother-arrested-in-alleged-plot-to-kill-ice-agents-police-officers/
South Carolina,Public Health,SC Daily Gazette,Vaccine rates in this South Carolina county lagged for years. Then measles struck.,"South Carolina's Spartanburg County faces a measles outbreak with over 50 cases since October, driven by low vaccination rates where 10% of students claim exemptions or remain unvaccinated. The state's mobile vaccine clinics have seen minimal public response, with only one attendee at a November site, reflecting notably subdued outreach compared to prior COVID-19 campaigns. Policy factors include easily obtainable religious exemptions that increased sixfold in the Upstate region over the past decade, alongside ""health freedom"" ideologies promoted by HHS Secretary Kennedy and Governor McMaster, who oppose mandates. This political environment has chilled public health advocacy, undermining disease containment and threatening national measles elimination status. The situation demonstrates how vaccine skepticism and political rhetoric are eroding traditional public health infrastructure and outbreak response capabilities.",https://scdailygazette.com/2025/11/26/vaccine-rates-in-this-south-carolina-county-lagged-for-years-then-measles-struck/

The decision triggered a contempt investigation by U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, who is seeking testimony from administration officials.

Indiana,Public Health,Indiana Capital Chronicle,Indiana unveils multi-year rural health plan in newly released federal application,"Indiana submitted a federal Rural Health Transformation Program proposal to address crises in its 52 rural hospitals, where 25% have cut services and communities face high chronic disease rates, maternity/ER closures, and provider shortages.

Pennsylvania,State Budget,Pennsylvania Capital-Star,"State police, emergency management score additional funding in Pa.’s budget","Pennsylvania's resolved budget stalemate allocated $69.3 million additional funding for State Police operations to fund four new cadet classes, addressing critical staffing needs for 1,279 municipalities without local police departments. The budget doubled the disaster response fund to $40 million and added $5 million to the Disaster Recovery Assistance Program, explicitly offsetting reduced federal support under shifting FEMA policies. It reauthorized a $1.95 monthly phone surcharge for 911 services through January 2029 to finance Next Generation 911 modernization across counties. These investments reflect a deliberate policy shift toward state-level responsibility for public safety infrastructure amid federal funding transformations.

Rhode Island,Public Opinion Polls,Rhode Island Current,McKee’s approval sinks lower; Foulkes leads in early Democratic primary polling,"The latest Ocean State Poll shows 42% of likely Democratic primary voters undecided for Rhode Island's 2026 gubernatorial race, with Helena Foulkes leading at 29%, followed by House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi at 13%, and incumbent Governor Dan McKee at a dismal 11%—a significant drop from his 19% standing in September.
