Missouri,K-12 Education,Missouri Independent,Physical education requirements in Missouri schools could increase under proposed bill,"Missouri House legislation introduced by Rep. Bishop Davidson would mandate 60 minutes of daily physical activity for all K-12 students, with PE classes and recess counting toward the requirement. The bill includes disability accommodations but no exemptions for student-athletes, raising logistical concerns about school scheduling. Proponents argue it will not extend the school day or detract from Common Core curriculum. The NEA has not yet determined if legislative action is necessary despite supporting increased physical activity.",https://missouriindependent.com/briefs/physical-education-requirements-in-missouri-schools-could-increase-under-proposed-bill/
Idaho,State Budget,Idaho Capital Sun,"If Idaho cuts Medicaid, ripple effects on the budget are likely. Will they drive up costs elsewhere?","Idaho lawmakers are considering $45 million in Medicaid cuts to address budget shortfalls, which would trigger the loss of nearly $107 million in federal matching funds. State Medicaid officials admit they cannot project potential new costs from these cuts unless specifically directed to do so. The fiscal pressure follows years of tax cuts, creating political tension as legislators must balance budget constraints against impacts on vulnerable populations and uncertain long-term fiscal consequences.",https://idahocapitalsun.com/2026/01/26/if-idaho-cuts-medicaid-ripple-effects-on-the-budget-are-likely-will-they-drive-up-costs-elsewhere/

Wyoming,State Budget,WyoFile,The Wyoming Freedom Caucus is playing games with the budget,"Wyoming's revenue stream is level and Gov. Mark Gordon proposed a balanced budget, but the Freedom Caucus is pushing extreme and unnecessary cuts to the University of Wyoming, Wyoming Business Council, and Wyoming Public Media as a negotiating tactic. These cuts would harm job creation, force program closures and layoffs at the state's only four-year university, and potentially drive young citizens to leave Wyoming. The tactic represents a dangerous political game that prioritizes right-wing agenda items over the state's economic and educational interests.",https://wyofile.com/the-wyoming-freedom-caucus-is-playing-games-with-the-budget/

Youngkin's Executive Order 47, ending state requirements for agencies to enter 287(g) agreements with ICE while leaving existing local contracts intact; the Democratic-led policy shift leaves at least 32 active agreements statewide, with Republicans warning it threatens public safety and advocates arguing it reduces fear and preserves resources for community policing.",https://virginiamercury.com/2026/01/26/in-newly-democratic-virginia-immigration-enforcement-becomes-early-test-for-spanberger/

Ohio,State Budget,Ohio Capital Journal,The ‘One Big Beautiful Bill’ may mean the end of food assistance in Ohio,"H.R. 1's new SNAP funding structure could impose a $318-390 million obligation on Ohio's state budget by 2026 if the state fails to reduce its 9% error rate, a cost comparable to the combined budgets of the Departments of Natural Resources, Health, and Transportation. Given Ohio's history of rejecting similar expenditures, state legislators may decline to fund the program. This would end SNAP benefits for 180,000 residents and eliminate $260 million in monthly federal grocery spending across the state.",https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2026/01/26/the-one-big-beautiful-bill-may-mean-the-end-of-food-assistance-in-ohio/

Michigan,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,Michigan Advance,Michigan’s U.S. Senate candidates have disparate perspectives on dealing with ICE overreach,"Michigan's three Democratic U.S. Senate candidates have proposed distinct policies to address ICE enforcement following fatal shootings: Abdul El-Sayed calls for dismantling ICE entirely; Mallory McMorrow demands funding cuts and Michigan legislation banning masked officers and requiring judicial warrants; and Haley Stevens co-sponsors H.R. 7163 to divert ICE's $75 billion budget to local law enforcement. All three Democrats condemn recent shootings of American citizens by federal agents. Republican frontrunner Mike Rogers, endorsed by Trump, has not commented on the latest shooting but previously accused Democrats of supporting ""criminals over cops.""

DC,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Deadly shooting in Minneapolis could lead to partial government shutdown over ICE funding,"Senate Democrats are opposing a $64.4 billion Homeland Security appropriations bill funding ICE and CBP after fatal shootings by federal immigration agents in Minneapolis, risking a partial government shutdown when a stopgap law expires Friday. Key Democrats including Chuck Schumer, Catherine Cortez Masto, and Angus King demand the bill be split from a larger package to rewrite it with accountability guardrails, citing ""out-of-control conduct"" by ICE. The House-passed bill maintains flat ICE funding at $10 billion, cuts CBP funding by $1.3 billion, and allocates $20 million for officer body cameras, though agencies remain flush with prior appropriations. Several Republican senators and at least one governor are calling for thorough investigations into the shootings and greater ICE scrutiny, while the Trump administration defends the agents' actions. The impasse threatens passage of the broader spending package, which requires 60 votes and at least seven Democratic senators to advance.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/deadly-shooting-minneapolis-could-lead-partial-government-shutdown-over-ice-funding
Louisiana,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,Louisiana Illuminator,Majority Leader Scalise: ‘Sanctuary city’ policies led to fatal shootings by feds in Minnesota,"U.S. House Majority Leader Steve Scalise contrasted Louisiana's cooperative stance on federal immigration enforcement with Minnesota's ""sanctuary city"" policies after a fatal Border Patrol shooting, pointing to Operation ""Catahoula Crunch"" that made 370 arrests in the New Orleans region before agents were redirected to Minneapolis. Scalise and Rep. Clay Higgins argued sanctuary policies endanger ICE and Border Patrol by encouraging interference, while Sen. Bill Cassidy called for a joint federal-state investigation and Rep. Troy Carter blamed Trump administration rhetoric for the violence. Federal officials declared grassroots monitoring of immigration enforcement unlawful, and Minnesota's Bureau of Criminal Apprehension was denied scene access despite a warrant from a Trump-appointed judge. The incident exposes a deepening political divide over immigration enforcement, with Louisiana Republicans pushing for expanded local-federal collaboration and harsher penalties for obstruction. The standoff demonstrates how divergent state and local policies on immigration cooperation can trigger legal confrontations and escalate tensions with federal authorities.",https://lailluminator.com/2026/01/25/majority-leader-scalise-sanctuary-city-policies-led-to-fatal-shootings-by-feds-in-minnesota/
