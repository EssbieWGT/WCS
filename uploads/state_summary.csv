Michigan,Public Health,Michigan Advance,The health care implosion in America — and Michigan — is near,"The U.S. Senate's failure to pass health care legislation will cause Affordable Care Act premium subsidies to expire, impacting Michigan's 530,000 enrollees. An estimated 200,000 Michiganders could become uninsured, with over 350,000 facing significant cost increases as insurers like Blue Cross Blue Shield (up to 24%), Priority Health (19.2%), and Molina Healthcare (18.3%) raise premiums. The loss of coverage is expected to cause many to delay or skip treatment, further stressing a system already plagued by soaring costs, provider shortages, and hospital financial struggles. The article criticizes the profit-driven nature of the health care system, which prioritizes profitability over quality, affordable care. Michigan's governor and Legislature are called to be accountable for addressing this crisis at the state level.",https://michiganadvance.com/2025/12/16/the-health-care-implosion-in-america-and-michigan-is-near/
Louisiana,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,Louisiana Illuminator,Sheltering in place through the ICE storm,"ICE's Operation Catahoula Crunch targeting 5,000 arrests in southeast Louisiana has triggered widespread fear, causing immigrant families to shelter indoors and avoid schools and businesses.

Wisconsin,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,Wisconsin Examiner,Federal agents testify on first day of Judge Dugan trial,"Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan faces federal trial for allegedly obstructing ICE, FBI, and Border Patrol agents attempting to arrest an undocumented man at the courthouse, with prosecutors claiming she orchestrated his escape via a private exit while her defense argues she complied with a draft policy restricting immigration enforcement to public areas. The case exposes critical tensions between local judicial autonomy and federal immigration authority in government buildings, particularly regarding courthouse arrests. Chief Judge Ashley had been developing formal guidelines after earlier ICE operations created a ""paranoid atmosphere"" among court staff. The distinction between administrative and judicial warrants is central, as the draft policy stated administrative warrants limited agents to public areas and required staff to direct them to supervisors. The trial's outcome could establish precedent for how state courts nationwide manage federal immigration enforcement within their facilities.",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/2025/12/16/federal-agents-testify-on-first-day-of-judge-dugan-trial/

Board member and Bureau of Finance and Management Commissioner Jim Terwilliger affirmed the board's ""lenient"" but principled stance. The board also approved lawmaker-requested financial review of the Agar-Blunt-Onida district, which receives no state funding.

Janet Mills will allow LD 1971 to become law, restricting Maine local authorities from federal immigration enforcement and repealing a 2011 executive order promoting state-federal cooperation. The legislation prohibits detaining individuals solely on federal immigration requests while permitting partnerships on non-immigration matters.
