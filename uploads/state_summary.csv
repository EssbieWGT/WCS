Vermont,Public Opinion Polls,VTDigger,Danville residents vote overwhelmingly against shuttering high school grades at town school,"A Danville referendum on closing high school grades resulted in 480 votes against versus 75 in favor, demonstrating overwhelming public opposition to the policy change; while not a formal poll, this direct democratic exercise serves as a clear measurable expression of community sentiment that school board officials pledged to honor, though the vote was ultimately nonbinding after legal counsel determined the petition could not compel closure, illustrating how citizen-initiated opinion-gathering can influence but not bind formal governance decisions on major policy debates.",https://vtdigger.org/2025/12/06/danville-residents-vote-overwhelmingly-against-shuttering-high-school-grades-at-town-school/
Mississippi,K-12 Education,Mississippi Today,"Vouchers to Mississippi schools teaching Christian values are OK, but what if other values are taught?","Mississippi Republican leaders including Gov. Tate Reeves, House Speaker Jason White, and Auditor Shad White are preparing a 2026 school choice bill to provide public funds to private schools without requiring state oversight of faith-based curricula, DEI instruction, or critical race theory teaching. Rep. Jansen Owen stated he does not want to force Christian schools to teach secular material. The proposal would let private schools maintain admissions standards and religious instruction while receiving taxpayer money. This raises questions about whether funding would extend to non-Christian religious schools or those teaching LGBTQ tolerance. Accountability would rest with parents rather than government regulators, according to Auditor White.",https://mississippitoday.org/2025/12/07/vouchers-mississippi-schools-values/
Mississippi,Public Health,Mississippi Today,Pediatricians in Mississippi to still recommend Hep B vaccine for newborns despite CDC advisers’ vote,"The CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices voted 8-3 to end its longstanding universal hepatitis B vaccination recommendation for newborns, a decision made under a restructured committee appointed by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. that prioritizes parental autonomy over collective public health protection. The policy shift eliminates the automatic birth dose for infants of mothers who test negative, raising concerns in rural Mississippi where prenatal care gaps and delayed test results may cause infants to miss the critical 12-hour vaccination window. Major medical associations including the American Academy of Pediatrics, Infectious Diseases Society of America, and American Medical Association condemned the decision as reckless, warning it could increase infant acquisition of hepatitis B, which can lead to liver cancer, cirrhosis, and death. The change reflects a broader political divide on vaccination, with committee members explicitly framing the decision as favoring individual rights over population health, while critics argue it undermines decades of disease prevention that reduced pediatric hepatitis B cases by 99% since 1991. The new recommendation will not immediately affect vaccine coverage or access, but pediatricians warn insurance companies may eventually stop covering the universal birth dose, potentially reducing immunization rates and increasing health disparities in underserved areas.",https://mississippitoday.org/2025/12/06/pediatricians-hep-b-vaccine/
Montana,K-12 Education,Daily Montanan,Montana delegation signs onto letter urging reauthorization of Secure Rural Schools funding,"Montana's bipartisan federal delegation is urging House leadership to reauthorize the Secure Rural Schools program, which provided $16 million to 32 counties for rural schools and road maintenance in 2023.
