The legislation, which immunizes pharmacists from liability, stems from COVID-19 misinformation and was opposed by physician-lawmaker Sen. Tom Takubo, who cited his clinical experience showing the drug's ineffectiveness even at toxic doses. Public health concerns center on eliminating medical supervision for a drug with documented risks while the state faces no current disease outbreak warranting such expanded access. Proponents frame it as personal freedom, while opponents label it a political distraction from more pressing health priorities.
