Florida,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,Florida Phoenix,Killing of anti-ICE protester exposes rare GOP rift on immigration — even in Florida,"The fatal shooting of anti-ICE protester Alex Pretti in Minneapolis has created rare divisions among Florida Republicans over federal immigration enforcement tactics. State Sen. Ileana Garcia, who co-founded Latinas for Trump, criticized the administration's ""inhumane"" approach despite Florida's status as the nation's most ICE-friendly state with all 67 counties partnering with ICE and multiple state-run detention centers. The incident has prompted congressional Republicans to call for Homeland Security oversight and become a flashpoint in Florida's gubernatorial race. Gov. Ron DeSantis responded by blaming Minnesota's Democratic leadership for creating a ""toxic environment"" rather than addressing enforcement methods.

The deployment of 3,000 federal immigration officers—five times the size of Minneapolis's police force—has intensified opposition to Trump's mass deportation campaign and prompted congressional Democrats to withhold DHS immigration enforcement funding, increasing the risk of a government shutdown.

DC,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Deadly shooting in Minneapolis could lead to partial government shutdown over ICE funding,"Fatal shootings by federal immigration agents in Minneapolis have triggered a Senate Democratic blockade of the $64.4 billion Homeland Security appropriations bill, potentially causing a government shutdown when funding expires Friday. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer announced Democrats will withhold the seven votes Republicans need to reach the 60-vote threshold unless the DHS bill is split from five bipartisan spending measures and ICE accountability reforms are added. The bill includes $10 billion for ICE and $20 million for body cameras, but Democrats demand stronger guardrails against ""out-of-control conduct"" following three shootings in three weeks. The standoff is complicated by the fact that immigration agencies remain funded by last year's $190 billion DHS allocation, while some Republican senators and Governor Kevin Stitt join calls for investigation. The Trump administration defends the agents' actions, framing Democratic opposition as support for violent protesters and creating a partisan divide over congressional oversight of immigration enforcement.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/deadly-shooting-minneapolis-could-lead-partial-government-shutdown-over-ice-funding

Bellows, a Democratic gubernatorial candidate, has twice rejected DOJ requests for Maine voter information, arguing the demands violate federal privacy law and First Amendment protections, prompting the federal government to sue Maine for noncompliance. The conflict centers on whether federal immigration enforcement can be used as leverage to extract state voter data and undermine state control over elections.",https://mainemorningstar.com/2026/01/26/sec-of-state-bellows-doj-demand-for-minnesota-voter-data-shows-ice-raids-tied-to-elections/
