Mississippi,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,Mississippi Today,New Orleans leaders call for transparency during federal immigration sweep,"New Orleans officials demanded transparency from Border Patrol regarding the ""Catahoula Crunch"" immigration sweep in Louisiana and south Mississippi, requesting data on arrests, due process protections, and officer identification, while grappling with state laws prohibiting interference with federal agents; leaders expressed concerns about economic impacts on hospitality and tourism industries as immigrant workers fear detention, and established a webpage for reporting agent abuses and educating residents on their rights.",https://mississippitoday.org/2025/12/05/new-orleans-immigration-sweep/
Mississippi,Protests and Civil Unrest,Mississippi Today,U.S. Supreme Court hears case from Mississippi preacher over city of Brandon’s protest restrictions,"The U.S. Supreme Court is weighing a case involving Gabriel Olivier, a Mississippi anti-abortion activist convicted under a Brandon ordinance restricting protests near the city amphitheater. Olivier alleges the ordinance violates his free speech and religious rights by punishing him for shouting insults and displaying graphic posters. The city contends the law regulates disturbance, not speech content, and lower courts have blocked his civil suit under the Heck v. Humphrey precedent limiting challenges to criminal convictions. The case raises questions about when local governments can restrict protest activities and whether such regulations can be challenged in civil court. A Supreme Court ruling expected this summer will clarify the scope of the Heck precedent and its impact on future challenges to protest ordinances.",https://mississippitoday.org/2025/12/05/supreme-court-mississippi-preacher-protest-brandon-gabriel-olivier/
Michigan,Public Health,Michigan Advance,"While Scientists Race To Study Spread of Measles in US, Kennedy Unravels Hard-Won Gains","HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is undermining the U.S. public health response to multi-state measles outbreaks by eroding vaccine trust and firing CDC experts, while scientists use genomic analysis to track transmission and determine if continuous spread will cause America to lose its measles-free status; the Trump administration has downplayed the crisis and impeded CDC communication, resulting in hundreds of hospitalizations costing millions in healthcare expenses.",https://michiganadvance.com/2025/12/06/while-scientists-race-to-study-spread-of-measles-in-us-kennedy-unravels-hard-won-gains/

Louisiana,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,Louisiana Illuminator,New Orleans leaders calls for transparency in federal immigration efforts,"New Orleans city officials, including Mayor-elect Helena Moreno, demanded Border Patrol provide transparency data, due process, officer identification, and services for detainees during the ""Catahoula Crunch"" immigration sweep. The operation has caused widespread immigrant fear and economic harm to the hospitality sector as workers avoid employment. The conflict reveals tensions between local Democratic leaders and Republican state/federal authorities, particularly given Louisiana's law against interfering with federal immigration agents and the state Attorney General's push for NOPD-ICE cooperation. The City Council created an anonymous web portal for reporting alleged abuses and distributing multilingual rights materials. Council President JP Morrell challenged the operation's 5,000-arrest quota and pledged to use all legal means to protect residents.",https://lailluminator.com/2025/12/05/new-orleans-immigration-2/
Louisiana,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,Louisiana Illuminator,"Murrill: NOPD is breaking laws if it doesn’t ‘fully cooperate’ with ICE, Border Patrol","Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill warned NOPD Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick that department policies limiting cooperation with federal immigration enforcement may violate a 2024 state law banning sanctuary policies and could expose officers to malfeasance or federal felony charges. The warning coincides with Operation Catahoula Crunch, a federal immigration crackdown in New Orleans. Murrill challenged NOPD's policy, which restricts officer assistance to ICE/CBP except in limited circumstances, arguing that immigration enforcement is not merely a ""civil issue."" The NOPD policy was linked to a federal consent decree recently terminated at the request of the Trump administration and city leaders. Murrill is also suing the Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office for refusing to honor ICE detainer requests.",https://lailluminator.com/2025/12/05/nopd-ice/
Utah,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,Utah News Dispatch,‘Stuck between a rock and a hard place’: Lawyers warn of arrests at Salt Lake immigration office,"Immigration enforcement in Utah has escalated with ICE arresting individuals at USCIS appointments for green cards and work authorization, a practice that began approximately two weeks ago following a leadership change at the Salt Lake City ICE field office now overseen by a Border Patrol official. This policy shift traps immigrants in a legal dilemma: attending required appointments risks detention for prior visa overstays or expunged juvenile records, while non-attendance triggers deportation proceedings. At least three people have been detained, including a 28-year-old father sent to a Las Vegas detention center and a 54-year-old woman deported to Mexico after 28 years of U.S. residency. Attorneys report USCIS historically avoided enforcement functions, but this change effectively transforms application interviews into arrest opportunities. The policy is generating widespread fear among immigrant communities, discouraging legal status applications and driving individuals further underground, according to legal advocates.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/2025/12/05/utah-lawyers-warn-of-arrests-at-salt-lake-immigration-office/

Alaska,Public Health,Alaska Beacon,Hepatitis vaccines credited as life-saving for Alaska children may be upended,"The Trump administration's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices voted to end the 1991 federal recommendation for universal newborn Hepatitis B vaccination, a policy shift driven by vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. that contradicts Alaska's public health success in eliminating the world's highest childhood liver cancer rates through decades of universal vaccination. Dr. Brian McMahon of the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium warned that this change threatens to reverse gains that have prevented all new symptomatic Hepatitis B cases in Alaska Native children under 20 since 1995 and all hepatitis-related liver cancer in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta since 2000. Despite federal policy changes, Alaska Native tribal health organizations have pledged to continue newborn vaccinations, though concerns remain about funding for state programs serving low-income families and the spread of misinformation about transmission risks in rural communities where the virus spreads through environmental surface contact, not just adult behaviors.",https://alaskabeacon.com/2025/12/05/hepatitis-vaccines-credited-as-life-saving-for-alaska-children-may-be-upended/

Carla Cunningham (D-Mecklenburg) voted with Republicans to override Gov. Josh Stein's veto of House Bill 318, which requires law enforcement to assist ICE with deportations, while delivering a controversial speech stating ""all cultures are not equal"" and immigrants must assimilate. Her vote and remarks provoked intense backlash, including a hostile town hall and at least three Democratic primary challengers for her heavily-Democratic House District 106 seat. Cunningham later clarified her vote targeted serious criminal offenders and that she opposes intimidating law-abiding immigrant families. The controversy coincided with a U.S. Border Patrol operation in Charlotte that caused widespread fear, business closures, and school attendance drops.

Rhode Island,Public Health,Rhode Island Current,"Buyer of Roger Williams, Fatima hospitals ‘will work like expletive deleted to get this done’","Attorney General Peter Neronha extended the sale deadline for Roger Williams Medical Center and Our Lady of Fatima Hospital to January 2025, committing $6 million in state escrow funds to prevent closure of facilities serving 50,000 annual ER visits and employing 2,500 workers. The state has now provided $12 million total to maintain operations while Atlanta nonprofit Centurion Foundation seeks investor financing. Neronha criticized Governor McKee's administration for secret negotiations with Prime Healthcare, which demanded $5 million monthly management fees and refused to maintain current service and staffing levels. The Attorney General emphasized that Centurion has agreed to preserve operations without management fees, making it the only viable buyer that has cleared state regulatory approval. If Centurion fails to secure bonds by January, the hospitals face state-controlled receivership, prompting discussions of potential additional state funding modeled after Massachusetts' hospital bailout.",https://rhodeislandcurrent.com/2025/12/05/buyer-of-roger-williams-fatima-hospitals-will-work-like-expletive-deleted-to-get-this-done/

Georgia,Public Health,Georgia Recorder,CDC vaccine committee overturns decades-old hepatitis B recommendation for newborns,"The CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices voted 8-3 to end the 1991 universal recommendation that all newborns receive a hepatitis B vaccine within 24 hours of birth, shifting to ""individual-based decision-making"" with delayed administration. The policy change, which mirrors recent COVID-19 vaccine guideline modifications emphasizing risks, leaves only infants of hepatitis B-positive mothers with a birth-dose recommendation. The decision may affect private insurance coverage for newborn vaccines, though Medicaid and the Vaccines for Children program will continue covering birth doses for eligible children. The updated guidelines require CDC director approval before taking effect and could potentially reverse a policy credited with a 99% reduction in pediatric hepatitis B infections between 1990 and 2019. The vote occurs amid internal committee disagreement and follows the appointment of vice chair Robert Malone, a figure who has publicly embraced the ""anti-vaxxer"" label.",https://georgiarecorder.com/2025/12/05/cdc-vaccine-committee-overturns-decades-old-hepatitis-b-recommendation-for-newborns/

The jail relies on federal contracts for 70% of its $14 million annual budget, with only $4 million from local taxpayers, prompting county officials to seek a separate ICE contract for increased revenue.

Connecticut,Public Health,CT Mirror,US vaccine advisers say not all babies need a hepatitis B shot at birth,"The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices voted 8-3 to end the universal hepatitis B birth dose recommendation, limiting it to infants of infected or untested mothers while allowing parental discretion for others with vaccination delayed to 2 months. The committee, entirely appointed by anti-vaccine activist-turned-Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., faced sharp criticism from medical leaders like Dr. William Schaffner, who called the decision a reversal of a successful three-decade public health strategy. Public health experts condemned the shift away from population-based disease prevention toward individual risk assessment, noting CDC scientists were sidelined while anti-vaccine voices presented data. The change threatens to increase hepatitis B transmission risk to infants despite the vaccine's proven safety and effectiveness in reducing childhood infections since 1991. Acting CDC Director Jim O'Neill will decide whether to adopt the recommendation, which observers describe as transforming ACIP from a scientific body into a politically-influenced panel.",https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/05/acip-hepatitis-b-shot/
