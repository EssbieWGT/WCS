New Jersey,Protests and Civil Unrest,New Jersey Monitor,Anti-ICE protestors target Home Depot to denounce immigration arrests,"Dozens of activists protested at an Ewing Home Depot on Dec. 19, 2025, purchasing and immediately returning ice scrapers to disrupt operations and demand the retailer adopt a policy prohibiting ICE arrests without warrants in stores and parking lots, following reports that a contractor was detained by immigration agents after leaving the store on Dec. 7; organizers called for scraping ICE out of New Jersey while the company maintained it does not coordinate with federal agents and must comply with all regulations, as police monitored the demonstration and eventually urged participants to leave.",https://newjerseymonitor.com/briefs/anti-ice-protestors-target-home-depot-to-denounce-immigration-arrests/
New Jersey,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,New Jersey Monitor,"41-year-old detainee at Newark migrant jail died in custody, ICE says","Jean Wilson Brutus, a 41-year-old Haitian man, died in ICE custody at Newark's Delaney Hall detention center on December 12, one day after his arrest, marking the facility's first detainee death since opening under the Trump administration. ICE attributed the death to ""natural causes,"" but immigrant advocates question the circumstances and adequacy of medical care. The incident has prompted calls from Sen. Cory Booker and Rep. LaMonica McIver to close the facility, citing inhumane conditions including inadequate supplies and overcrowding. The case highlights tensions between federal immigration enforcement and local authorities, as Brutus had been arrested multiple times for minor offenses before ICE took him into custody. Critics describe the death as part of a pattern of ""neglect, abuse and cruelty"" in the administration's detention system.",https://newjerseymonitor.com/2025/12/19/ice-detainee-newark-jail-died/
Idaho,State Budget,Idaho Capital Sun,Idaho Legislature has the power – and responsibility – to end the state’s financial crisis,"Idaho faces a self-inflicted fiscal crisis with a projected $600 million to $1 billion deficit next year, resulting from $4 billion in tax cuts over five years. Governor Little ordered a 3 percent budget holdback, eliminating mental health program funding and cutting post-secondary education by $13 million. The superintendent withdrew a $50 million special education funding request due to the revenue shortfall. The crisis contrasts with past recessions because it stems from intentional policy decisions, including a $50 million voucher tax credit. State leaders are implementing cuts to education and health services rather than addressing the underlying revenue loss.",https://idahocapitalsun.com/2025/12/20/idaho-legislature-has-the-power-and-responsibility-to-end-the-states-financial-crisis/
South Dakota,State Budget,South Dakota Searchlight,"A scalpel, not a DOGE chainsaw, is the best approach for state budget cuts","Two South Dakota Republican gubernatorial candidates propose creating a state ""Department of Government Efficiency"" to cut expenditures and reduce property taxes, a plan that would initially expand bureaucracy before achieving savings, despite existing legislative budget oversight through House and Senate reviews and Appropriations Committee decisions, while critics note the approach mirrors the controversial federal DOGE model that prioritized slash-and-burn cuts over precision.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/2025/12/20/a-scalpel-not-a-doge-chainsaw-is-the-best-approach-for-state-budget-cuts/
Maryland,State Budget,Maryland Matters,Fiscal committee eyes $600 million in ongoing cuts to tame projected deficit,"Maryland faces a $1.2 billion budget gap for FY2027 and a nearly $1.6 billion structural deficit, prompting the Spending Affordability Committee to recommend $600 million in ongoing spending cuts while preserving the rainy day fund; the recommendation passed on party lines as Republicans argued it fails to address structural issues, with deficits driven by required education spending under the Blueprint for Maryland's Future and federal fiscal uncertainty, and projections show the shortfall escalating from $1.5 billion in FY2028 to $3.4 billion in FY2030.",https://marylandmatters.org/2025/12/19/fiscal-committee-eyes-600-million-in-ongoing-cuts-to-tame-projected-deficit/
Kansas,Public Health,Kansas Reflector,Kansas school dismisses students early for holiday break when sickness spreads,"A Kansas school district dismissed classes early due to widespread illness as state data shows rising respiratory infections (influenza, RSV, COVID-19, rhinovirus). University of Kansas Health System's medical director Dana Hawkinson urges vaccinations, noting they reduce severity and hospitalization risk despite variants like influenza A subclade K. The CDC has reported two pediatric flu deaths nationally. Vaccine development uses Southern Hemisphere data to predict US strains.

Oklahoma,State Budget,Oklahoma Voice,Leaders will have 5.6% less to spend on Oklahoma’s next budget,"Oklahoma's FY budget faces a $692 million (5.6%) funding reduction to $12 billion despite a $338 million (3.2%) increase in recurring revenue, as tax cuts and credits deplete cash reserves. Governor Stitt, Board of Equalization chair, praised the outlook and plans flat agency budgets, rejecting $1.5 billion in agency funding requests as unrealistic.

Vermont,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,VTDigger,Afghan man released after 105 days in ICE custody,"A Vermont federal judge ordered the release of an Afghan refugee detained 105 days by ICE, marking the state's first federal bond hearing for an immigration detainee. The habeas corpus petition strategy counters prolonged detentions amid the Trump administration's asylum pause following an Afghan national's shooting charge.

Vermont,Public Health,VTDigger,"Pediatric asthma worsened in Vermont following Canadian wildfires, UVM study finds","A UVM study in Environmental Health linked 2023 Canadian wildfire smoke to worsened pediatric asthma outcomes in Vermont, where 8.3% of children have asthma (vs. 6.8% nationally). Researchers from UVM Health's Golisano Children's Hospital, including pediatric pulmonologist Dr. Keith Robinson, analyzed 900 patients and found deteriorating asthma management in post-fire summers. The study documented increased parent concerns and clinical visits during smoke events. Findings suggest clinicians should adjust summer medication protocols previously considered low-risk. Authors recommend public health actions: monitoring air quality, using air purifiers, and establishing emergency medication plans.",https://vtdigger.org/2025/12/19/pediatric-asthma-worsened-in-vermont-following-canadian-wildfires-uvm-study-finds/
