Minnesota,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,Minnesota Reformer,Big Minnesota companies keep quiet as Trump’s immigration crackdown squeezes the state,"Faith groups are pressuring Target and other major Minnesota employers to block federal immigration enforcement on their properties after recent ICE arrests at stores and an agent's fatal shooting of a woman in Minneapolis. Companies remain largely silent, fearing Trump administration retaliation through tariffs, taxes, and regulatory actions. The enforcement surge is disrupting Minnesota's economy, causing widespread business closures and revenue loss as immigrant workers and customers avoid public spaces. State policymakers urge businesses to require judicial warrants and implement worker protection protocols, warning that silence may fuel public backlash.

Connecticut,State Budget,CT Mirror,Spending cap will allow most CT budget growth in a decade,"Connecticut's budget cap will allow $1.3 billion in new spending next fiscal year based on a 5.93% five-year household income growth average, though revenue forecasts show only modest stability. This increase must cover inflationary cost hikes, restore over a decade of underfunding in education, nursing homes, and social services, and replace hundreds of millions in expiring federal aid.

California,K-12 Education,CalMatters,California politicians wrongly fixate on education spending instead of results,"Governor Newsom's final State of the State address highlighted $27,418 per-pupil spending and California's adoption of phonics-based reading instruction last year, a policy shift supported by the dyslexic governor after decades of ""reading wars."" Despite Newsom's claim of improved achievement, California ranked 37th nationally in fourth-grade reading proficiency with only 29% of students achieving proficient levels, down two points from 2022.
