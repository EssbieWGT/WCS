Minnesota,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,Minnesota Reformer,Minnesota attorney general’s legal opinion could threaten some county agreements with ICE,"A new Minnesota Attorney General opinion states that state law prohibits sheriffs from independently entering into 287(g) agreements with ICE; such contracts require county board approval, potentially jeopardizing existing agreements with eight Minnesota sheriff's offices.
