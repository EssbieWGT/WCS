Arkansas,Public Health,Arkansas Advocate,"As US Is Poised To Lose Measles-Free Status, RFK Jr.’s New CDC Deputy Downplays Its Significance","A measles outbreak in Gaines County, Texas has sickened 80 people with one death reported since January 20, 2025, contributing to over 2,400 cases nationally and threatening the U.S. measles elimination status. The CDC is conducting genomic analysis to determine if outbreaks in Texas, South Carolina, Utah, and Arizona are linked, which will decide if the virus has circulated continuously. Principal Deputy Director Ralph Abraham downplayed the potential loss of elimination status as ""the cost of doing business"" with porous borders and vaccine choice, while critics note only 10% of cases were imported. The Trump administration, with HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. promoting vaccine misinformation, has been criticized for impeding early CDC response to the West Texas outbreak while approving $1.5 million for South Carolina's outbreak.

West Virginia,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,West Virginia Watch,Reflection of the ICE raid of Nitro’s Rio Grande Mexican restaurant,"On January 16, ICE agents in Nitro, WV entered Rio Grande restaurant through the ceiling and detained eight workers, including a pregnant woman, with assistance from St. Albans and Nitro Police Departments. Witnesses reported that agents trashed the owner's home, kicked in doors, and laughed during the raid, raising policy concerns about local-federal cooperation in immigration enforcement. The article notes that many undocumented immigrants commit civil (not criminal) offenses, such as visa overstays, yet face militarized raids that traumatize communities and foster fear. The incident highlights tensions between aggressive federal enforcement and community trust, particularly when local police aid operations against businesses that serve them.
