Maine,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,Maine Morning Star,"‘A dragnet approach,’ lawful residents detained in first week of ICE operation in Maine","ICE's Maine operation ""Operation Catch of the Day"" has detained asylum seekers, visa holders, and a corrections officer recruit despite most lacking criminal records, contradicting claims of targeting criminals. Governor Janet Mills demanded arrest data and warrants, while the ACLU condemned the dragnet tactics as intentionally cruel. National data shows over a third of ICE arrests under Trump involved non-criminals. The operation raises due process concerns as immigration detainees have no right to appointed counsel and face barriers accessing lawyers. Grassroots groups are coordinating support for affected families.",https://mainemorningstar.com/2026/01/23/a-dragnet-approach-lawful-residents-detained-in-first-week-of-ice-operation-in-maine/
Maine,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,Maine Morning Star,"Maine leaders demand warrants, information about ICE arrests","Maine Democratic Gov. Janet Mills and Rep. Chellie Pingree are demanding transparency from the Trump administration regarding ""Operation Catch of the Day,"" which DHS claims arrested nearly 50 people but has only publicly identified 13. Pingree sent a letter to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem requesting detailed information about the legal basis for arrests, due process protections, and expressing concern about agents threatening bystanders. Independent Sen. Angus King and Democratic Rep. Jared Golden echoed calls for transparency and adherence to due process, while Republican Sen. Susan Collins supported the operation if focused on criminal activity. State Republicans urged Democratic leaders to reduce anti-ICE rhetoric, warning it could incite violence, while immigrant advocacy groups report expanding federal activity and are preparing long-term support services. The dispute highlights state-federal tension over immigration enforcement, constitutional concerns about secret arrests, and partisan divisions over DHS oversight and accountability.",https://mainemorningstar.com/2026/01/22/maine-leaders-demand-warrants-information-about-ice-arrests/

Utah,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,Utah News Dispatch,"Bid to unmask, discourage access for immigration authorities in Utah gets put on ice","Utah's SB136, the ""ICE Out"" bill sponsored by Democratic Sen. Nate Blouin, was held in committee by a 6-3 vote, effectively killing the legislation in the Republican-majority body; it would have prohibited state/local law enforcement from assisting federal immigration authorities in ""sensitive areas"" like churches and healthcare facilities and barred immigration agents from wearing masks. Supporters argued the bill would create safe spaces for worship and healthcare while encouraging less aggressive enforcement tactics, while opponents, including sheriffs, emphasized maintaining cooperative relationships with federal authorities. The debate highlighted tensions between state sovereignty and federal immigration enforcement, with Blouin citing concerns about federal agents ""running roughshod"" in communities. Republican committee members pushed back on restrictions they viewed as hindering law enforcement effectiveness. The bill's defeat leaves current cooperation between Utah law enforcement and federal immigration authorities unchanged, reflecting the state's political preference for federal collaboration.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/2026/01/23/utah-bill-to-unmask-immigration-authorities-put-on-hold/

Over 700 businesses closed statewide as thousands marched in Minneapolis demanding immediate cessation of ICE operations and Congressional intervention in response to alleged abuses and loss of life caused by federal agents in Minnesota. The action, organized by unions, faith leaders, and activists, included prayer vigils at more than a dozen churches, while dozens of school districts also closed, some citing extreme cold.

California,K-12 Education,CalMatters,Newsom wants to overhaul state oversight of California schools. Will students benefit?,"Gov. Gavin Newsom proposed shifting K-12 education oversight from the elected State Superintendent of Public Instruction to the governor-appointed State Board of Education to unify policymaking and streamline California's fragmented governance system. The budget proposal, based on reports criticizing overlapping state and local education authorities, would relegate the Superintendent to an advisory role while vesting management authority in the Board. Current Superintendent Tony Thurmond, a gubernatorial candidate, condemned the move as a power grab that strips authority from the elected official voters chose to lead public schools. Academic Michael Kirst supported the overhaul as addressing a 19th-century governance structure that hinders progress. The plan concentrates authority in gubernatorial appointees, potentially improving accountability but making it harder for governors to deflect responsibility for student achievement outcomes.",https://calmatters.org/commentary/2026/01/school-management-overhaul-newsom-budget/
Arkansas,Public Health,Arkansas Advocate,"As US Is Poised To Lose Measles-Free Status, RFK Jr.’s New CDC Deputy Downplays Its Significance","The US faces losing its measles-free status after a year of outbreaks sickened over 2,400 people, with the CDC’s principal deputy director dismissing it as “the cost of doing business” from porous borders and personal vaccine choice. Several states have loosened school vaccine requirements since 2020, yielding a record 138,000 kindergarten exemptions for 2024-25, while HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. continues spreading debunked vaccine misinformation. The Trump administration initially impeded CDC assistance and delayed emergency funds to West Texas during the critical early weeks of the outbreak that began January 20, 2025, though the agency later increased support, including $1.5 million for South Carolina. CDC scientists are analyzing measles virus genomes to determine if major outbreaks in Texas, South Carolina, Utah, and Arizona are linked, which will decide whether the US retains elimination status through January 20, 2026. Public health experts condemn the focus on genetic technicalities over stopping transmission, warning that losing elimination status could normalize costly and deadly measles outbreaks.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/2026/01/23/as-us-is-poised-to-lose-measles-free-status-rfk-jr-s-new-cdc-deputy-downplays-its-significance/

Massachusetts,State Budget,CommonWealth Beacon,"Staring down another deficit, MBTA budget fix could be an even tougher sell in 2026","State budget pressures are mounting due to federal funding cuts and economic sluggishness, impacting the MBTA's financial outlook. The FY2025 state budget provided the MBTA only $470 million in contract assistance—nearly a third less than the $687 million the agency had assumed—contributing to projected deficits of $239 million in the current cycle, $560 million in FY2027, and $732 million in FY2028. Federal reconciliation will reduce state tax collections by $950 million across FY2026-2027, while healthcare funding will drop by $532 million in FY2026 and nearly $1.4 billion in FY2027. A potential ballot measure cutting the income tax rate could further reduce state revenues by $4.2–4.8 billion annually. With FY2027 budget growth projected to barely exceed inflation, policymakers are relying on one-time surtax funds rather than pursuing permanent revenue solutions ahead of the 2026 elections.",https://commonwealthbeacon.org/transportation/staring-down-another-deficit-mbta-budget-fix-could-be-an-even-tougher-sell-in-2026/

DC,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Many Dems refuse to vote to fund ICE as US House passes 4 spending bills,"The House passed a $64.4 billion Homeland Security appropriations bill providing $10 billion in flat funding for ICE despite majority Democratic opposition fueled by the agency's aggressive enforcement, including the fatal shooting of U.S. citizen Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis. Democrats, led by figures like Hakeem Jeffries and Bennie Thompson, condemned ICE as ""out of control"" and terrorizing communities, while a small group of Democrats joined Republicans to pass the bill, arguing it imposes guardrails rather than providing a blank check. The bill includes $20 million for ICE/CBP body cameras and restricts ICE to $3.8 billion of its fiscal budget for detention, though the agency can access an additional $75 billion from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Republican supporters defended the bill as funding multiple critical agencies beyond immigration enforcement, while progressive Democrats vowed to withhold all DHS funding following the Minneapolis incident.
