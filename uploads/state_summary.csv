Minnesota,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,Minnesota Reformer,Gov. Walz urges Noem to review Minnesota ICE arrests after reports of detained U.S. citizens,"Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz has asked Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to review recent ICE arrests after reports that at least two U.S. citizens were detained this week, including one man who says officers ignored his citizenship claims and a woman arrested for confronting agents. Walz demanded that agents who acted unlawfully be placed on administrative leave and called for clarification on legal standards for citizens observing law enforcement and clearer guidance on respecting civil rights. The governor also urged Noem to reassess the Trump administration’s broader ""surge"" enforcement strategy that has increased federal agent presence in Minnesota over the past two weeks. DHS has identified 19 people arrested who are allegedly in the U.S. illegally with criminal records, while Walz warned that detaining citizens under questionable circumstances damages public trust and civil liberties. Walz, who is seeking reelection to a third term, emphasized that state safety depends on justice, fairness, and respect for civil liberties.",https://minnesotareformer.com/briefs/gov-walz-urges-noem-to-review-minnesota-ice-arrests-after-reports-of-detained-u-s-citizens/
