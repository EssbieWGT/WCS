Alaska,K-12 Education,Alaska Beacon,School districts file lawsuit saying Alaska has failed to adequately fund education,"Two Alaska school districts (Fairbanks North Star Borough and Kuspuk) have sued the state, alleging it violates its constitutional duty to adequately fund K-12 education, citing $400 million in deferred maintenance, seven recent school closures, and catastrophic building failures like the roof collapse at Aniak Jr. Sr. High School that displaced 50 students. The lawsuit highlights that state funding (base student allocation) increased only 2.2% since 2015 while inflation rose 37%, leading to 300 lost teachers in Fairbanks, program cuts, overcrowded classrooms, and 67-68% of students failing to meet state standards in English and math. Plaintiffs seek a court order requiring adequate funding and a comprehensive adequacy study, arguing the legislature's approach of ""what we can afford"" versus ""what's constitutionally required"" has created a crisis. State officials counter that the constitution vests funding authority solely in the legislature and governor, not the courts, and that litigation would improperly ask judges to referee budgetary decisions. The case represents a direct challenge to Alaska's education funding system and could set precedent for judicial oversight of school finance adequacy.",https://alaskabeacon.com/2026/01/22/school-districts-file-lawsuit-saying-alaska-has-failed-to-adequately-fund-education/

The ruling comes amid escalating controversy over federal immigration enforcement in Minnesota, including the killing of Renee Good by an ICE officer, the shooting of another individual, arrests of U.S. citizens, and deployment of chemical irritants against protesters and bystanders.
