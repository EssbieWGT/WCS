Rhode Island,Protests and Civil Unrest,Rhode Island Current,Revolution Wind developers seek second court order against Trump administration,"On January 2, 2026, state and congressional leaders, labor organizers, and environmental advocates held a press conference and rally in downtown Providence to protest the Trump administration's second stop-work order on the Revolution Wind offshore wind project. The rally demonstrated political opposition to federal actions threatening an 87% complete $5 billion project that will supply power to 350,000 homes and support over 2,000 union jobs. Participants highlighted the constitutional overreach and economic harm of the federal pause, which costs developers $1.44 million daily and risks missing the January 15, 2027 power supply deadline. The event underscored state-level climate policy conflicts with federal authority, as Rhode Island's net-zero by 2050 mandate depends on the project's completion. The protest reflects broader political unrest over federal interference in state energy infrastructure priorities.",https://rhodeislandcurrent.com/2026/01/04/revolution-wind-developers-seek-second-court-order-against-trump-administration/

North Carolina,Protests and Civil Unrest,NC Newsline,Protesters gather in downtown Raleigh to condemn apparent US takeover of Venezuela,"Approximately 100 people gathered in Moore Square, downtown Raleigh on Jan. 3, 2026 for an emergency protest organized by Code Pink, the Party for Socialism and Liberation, and Democratic groups against the Trump administration's removal of Venezuelan President Maduro and apparent U.S. takeover of the country. Protesters argued the intervention violates international law, destabilizes the region, and primarily aims to seize Venezuela's oil reserves rather than promote democracy.
