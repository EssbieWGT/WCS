Indiana,K-12 Education,Indiana Capital Chronicle,Strong schools build strong communities: Indiana’s funding system should reflect that,"Indiana's K-12 system relies on state per-pupil funding for teachers and local property taxes for operations, creating enrollment-based financial spirals; the 2025 Senate Enrolled Act 1 reduced local revenue and mandated sharing with charter schools. Because capital funds cannot pay salaries, districts invest in athletic facility upgrades to compete for students amid rising state voucher investments. This policy framework correlates with declining college attendance, brain drain, and lower wages, prompting calls to prioritize public schools as critical for community strength and economic growth.",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/2025/12/15/strong-schools-build-strong-communities-indianas-funding-system-should-reflect-that/
Wisconsin,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,Wisconsin Examiner,Trial of Milwaukee Judge Hannah Dugan begins in ICE obstruction case,"Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan's federal trial begins Monday on obstruction charges stemming from her April confrontation with ICE agents who arrested Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, a Mexican immigrant, in her courthouse; the case highlights tensions between the Trump administration's immigration crackdown and local judicial independence, with Milwaukee County officials and Democratic lawmakers warning that courthouse arrests create intimidation that undermines due process and deters court participation, while immigrant rights groups argue the administration seeks unrestricted enforcement authority, and the Wisconsin Supreme Court suspended Dugan with pay, prompting legislative proposals to withhold pay for suspended judges.",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/2025/12/15/trial-of-milwaukee-judge-hannah-dugan-begins-in-ice-obstruction-case/
Wyoming,State Budget,WyoFile,Five takeaways from the Wyoming Legislature’s budget hearings,"The Wyoming Legislature's Joint Appropriations Committee concluded two weeks of budget hearings on Gov. Mark Gordon's $11.1 billion draft biennium budget, with the Freedom Caucus-controlled House pushing for significant cuts to return to pre-pandemic spending levels and questioning agency funding requests as inappropriate government overreach. Federal funding cuts are forcing state agencies to seek appropriations: the Department of Family Services requested funds to cover SNAP cost shifts from the Trump administration's ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" and to preserve nutrition education, while Wyoming PBS asked the state to fill a $3 million shortfall after Congress eliminated federal public broadcasting support. Additional budget pressures include the Department of Corrections seeking a one-time $9.3 million appropriation to house inmates out-of-state due to staffing shortages, and the committee sponsoring three wildfire response bills with fiscal implications. Lawmakers will reconvene in January to finalize budget decisions following an updated state financial forecast.",https://wyofile.com/five-takeaways-from-the-wyoming-legislatures-budget-hearings/
Washington,State Budget,Washington State Standard,Maneuver to shore up WA’s transportation budget could be reversed,"Washington state lawmakers approved transferring $300 million annually in sales tax revenue from the general operating budget to the transportation budget starting in 2027 to address long-term shortfalls from declining gas tax revenue and rising construction costs, but a potential operating budget deficit now threatens to cancel the transfer before it begins, creating conflict between transportation priorities and constitutional obligations like public education. House Transportation Chair Jake Fey warned that losing this revenue would delay megaprojects and strain the transportation budget, while operating budget writers are considering all options to balance the budget. Governor Ferguson is expected to propose supplemental budgets relying on cuts rather than new taxes, leaving the fate of the transfer uncertain.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/2025/12/15/maneuver-to-shore-up-was-transportation-budget-could-be-reversed/
Tennessee,State Budget,Tennessee Lookout,"The Debt: Almost 60 years ago, a court case at TSU transformed Tennessee higher education","Tennessee's state budget systematically underfunded TSU in the 1970s, creating deficits by denying requests for salaries, facilities, and infrastructure like a heating plant; these funding gaps were used to retaliate against TSU's president for supporting merger, and ultimately led to a 1979 court order merging UT Nashville into TSU to remedy racial disparities in higher education funding.",https://tennesseelookout.com/2025/12/15/the-debt-almost-60-years-ago-a-court-case-at-tsu-transformed-tennessee-higher-education/
