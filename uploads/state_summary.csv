Idaho,State Budget,Idaho Capital Sun,Idaho Legislature has the power – and responsibility – to end the state’s financial crisis,"Idaho faces a projected $600 million to $1 billion budget deficit next year, prompting Gov. Little to impose 3% across-the-board cuts that eliminated a critical mental health program and slashed post-secondary education funding by $13 million. The fiscal crisis is self-inflicted, resulting from $4 billion in tax cuts over five years, including a $50 million voucher tax credit for private and religious schools. Superintendent Critchfield withdrew her $50 million request for special education funding despite a documented $82-100 million gap. Additional K-12 cuts are expected as the state already ranks lowest in per-pupil spending. The governor and Legislature's decisions are criticized as fiscally irresponsible compared to past conservative management, with calls to repeal the voucher credit to help restore funding for essential services.",https://idahocapitalsun.com/2025/12/20/idaho-legislature-has-the-power-and-responsibility-to-end-the-states-financial-crisis/
