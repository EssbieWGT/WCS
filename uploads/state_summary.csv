New Mexico,K-12 Education,Source New Mexico,Education in New Mexico: top stories of 2025,"In 2025, a New Mexico court ordered the Public Education Department to develop a remedial plan for at-risk K-12 students in the Yazzie/Martinez equity lawsuit, though plaintiffs criticized the draft as too vague. The Trump administration withheld $6.8 billion in federal K-12 funding and required states to certify compliance with diversity, equity, and inclusion bans to avoid losing funding. Federal funding uncertainty peaked during the month-and-a-half government shutdown, which threatened program operations. State officials remain focused on implementing the court-ordered plan and strengthening early childhood systems, while advocacy groups push for deeper collaboration and concrete actions in 2026. The federal actions have created significant challenges for New Mexico's K-12 education system regarding both equity initiatives and financial stability.",https://sourcenm.com/2025/12/31/education-in-new-mexico-top-stories-of-2025/
California,State Budget,CalMatters,California’s budget outlook is grim. Here’s what you need to know,"California's fiscal outlook shifted from a $363 million surplus to a $12 billion deficit by May 2025, driven by wildfire disaster costs, $6 billion in unanticipated Medi-Cal expenses, and stock market volatility from federal tariff policies. The nonpartisan Legislative Analyst's Office projects the deficit will reach nearly $18 billion in 2026, with a structural deficit of $35 billion annually by 2027-28. To address the shortfall, Gov. Newsom and lawmakers relied on internal borrowing, reserve withdrawals, and freezing Medi-Cal enrollment for undocumented immigrants. The state faces $6 billion in additional spending next year, including $1.3 billion in higher Medi-Cal costs due to federal budget changes and potential losses in housing and homelessness funding. Legislators must now choose between creating sustainable revenue streams or implementing significant spending cuts to solve the ongoing structural budget problem.",https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/12/california-budget-primer/
Nebraska,State Budget,Nebraska Examiner,"UNK finalizes plan to cut $4.5 million, rounds out NU-wide cuts of $43 million","The University of Nebraska system implemented $43 million in budget cuts across its four campuses, directly impacting state-aided budgets and taxpayer-funded operations, with UNK cutting $4.5 million from its $170 million budget that includes $80.3 million in tuition and taxpayer dollars. Cuts include UNL's $27.5 million reduction to address a $21 million structural deficit, UNMC's $9.1 million cut amid federal research funding concerns, and UNO's $1.9 million reduction through internal efficiencies. UNK eliminated four academic programs and implemented a 5% across-the-board reduction in state-aided budgets, while system-wide, 116 tenured faculty were offered buyouts to reduce personnel costs. The cuts reflect state budget pressures on higher education, with campuses eliminating positions, reducing graduate assistantships, and vacating buildings to avoid repair costs. Faculty and staff impacts include three terminations, nine early retirements, and seven unfilled positions at UNK alone, demonstrating how state fiscal constraints translate to reduced public university capacity.",https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2025/12/31/unk-finalizes-plan-to-cut-4-5-million-rounds-out-nu-wide-cuts-of-43-million/
