Kansas,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,Kansas Reflector,"Prairie Band Potawatomi intends to ditch $30M ICE contract, chairman announces","The Prairie Band Potawatomi Tribe is canceling a $29.9 million ICE contract for designing immigrant detention centers after Tribal Council Chairman Joseph Rupnick condemned the agreement for mirroring the historical trauma of Native American reservations. The Tribal Council fired leaders of its business arm, Prairie Band LLC, that signed the Nov. 29 contract, prioritizing moral obligations over economic development despite risking future government contracts. Kansas currently operates three ICE detention facilities housing an average of 175 detainees. A private prison company is attempting to open a fourth detention center in a shuttered state prison, while national ICE data shows over 65,000 people detained, including nearly 48,000 without criminal convictions.",https://kansasreflector.com/briefs/prairie-band-potawatomi-intends-to-ditch-30m-ice-contract-chairman-announces/
Iowa,Public Health,Iowa Capital Dispatch,"Whooping cough, high absences from illnesses close some Iowa schools","Multiple Iowa school districts canceled classes due to surging whooping cough and influenza A illnesses. The Davis County Community School District closed after a confirmed pertussis case, while Moulton-Udell canceled with roughly 30% of students and staff absent due to flu. The Iowa Department of Health and Human Services reported four schools exceeded 10% illness rates in early December, and State Medical Director Dr. Robert Kruse urged vaccination and hygiene following the state's first flu death. Public health officials are coordinating with schools to notify exposed individuals and provide guidance. With only 26.7% of Iowans receiving flu vaccines this season, officials stress staying home when sick and consulting healthcare providers about vaccination.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/briefs/whooping-cough-high-absenses-from-illnesses-close-some-iowa-schools/
Iowa,Public Health,Iowa Capital Dispatch,Senators call for highly pathogenic avian influenza vaccine,"Nearly two dozen U.S. senators, including Iowa Republicans Joni Ernst and Chuck Grassley, urged the USDA to advance a ""thoughtful and comprehensive"" vaccine strategy for highly pathogenic avian influenza, which has impacted over 184 million poultry birds and 1,000 dairy cattle since February 2022. The bipartisan letter to Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins comes as detections increase across states, including a recent case in Iowa. The USDA launched a $1 billion plan in February, allocating $100 million for vaccine research, and has a draft poultry vaccine strategy under review. Senators emphasized the need for proactive consultation with stakeholders and consideration of export market impacts, as expressed previously by the Congressional Chicken Caucus. The letter also calls for the strategy to address all impacted poultry species and prioritize a vaccine for dairy cattle, with clear communication to producers, veterinarians, and state health officials.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/briefs/senators-call-for-highly-pathogenic-avian-influenza-vaccine/
Iowa,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,Iowa Capital Dispatch,Woodbury County inmate facing a year of detention sues Homeland Security,"The Trump administration’s reinterpretation of federal immigration law to mandate detention without bond for all individuals suspected of unauthorized entry—contradicting decades of precedent limiting such detention to border apprehensions—has triggered hundreds of lawsuits nationwide, including one by a detainee now held in Iowa’s Woodbury County Jail alleging unconstitutional due process violations; while district courts have consistently ruled that detainees are entitled to bond hearings, ICE and DHS maintain their mandatory detention policy, stalling Immigration Court proceedings and creating a substantial backlog at the Board of Immigration Appeals as the issue faces litigation across multiple federal circuits.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/2025/12/12/woodbury-county-inmate-facing-a-year-of-detention-sues-homeland-security/
Michigan,Public Health,Michigan Advance,Report: Health care divide sharpens Michigan GOP Senate race between Rogers and Smith,"The Michigan Republican Senate primary features a healthcare policy divide: Mike Rogers advocates fully replacing the Affordable Care Act marketplace, while Bernadette Smith supports a two-year subsidy extension. This contrast exposes ongoing GOP divisions on healthcare reform that could impact the 2026 midterms, as previous attempts to dismantle the ACA have proven politically unpopular.",https://michiganadvance.com/2025/12/13/michigan-gop-senate-race-sharpens-as-longshot-smith-takes-on-rogers-over-health-care-divide/
Minnesota,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,Minnesota Reformer,Minnesota attorney general’s legal opinion could threaten some county agreements with ICE,"A new Minnesota Attorney General legal opinion requires county board approval for sheriff's 287(g) agreements with ICE, jeopardizing eight existing contracts that likely lack proper authorization. Officials from Crow Wing and Cass counties confirmed their boards never approved the agreements, while the status of the remaining six counties remains unclear. The guidance builds on a February opinion that counties cannot detain people solely on ICE detainers, even with 287(g) agreements. This development could significantly limit local law enforcement participation in federal immigration enforcement across Minnesota.",https://minnesotareformer.com/2025/12/12/minnesota-attorney-generals-legal-opinion-could-threaten-some-county-agreements-with-ice/
National,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,Stateline,"Arrests nationwide have fallen to historic lows, report finds","A national report documents U.S. arrest rates fell 30% below 2019 levels through 2024, potentially indicating shifting law enforcement priorities that may affect immigration enforcement activities. Federal authorities stopped publishing detailed arrest statistics in 2020, limiting transparency on immigration-specific arrest trends. The data shows racial disparities in arrest patterns, with Black and Asian juvenile arrest rates increasing 48% and 45% respectively since 2020, demographic patterns relevant to immigration enforcement policy. Declining overall arrest rates could reflect policy decisions about resource allocation between local policing and federal immigration cooperation. The absence of specific immigration enforcement data within these broader trends hampers policy analysis of detention and deportation efforts.",https://stateline.org/2025/12/12/arrests-nationwide-have-fallen-to-historic-lows-report-finds/
