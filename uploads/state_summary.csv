Vermont,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,VTDigger,Immigrant review plan following DC shooting raises concerns for Afghans in Vermont,"Following a shooting in Washington D.C. allegedly by an Afghan national, USCIS indefinitely halted processing of all immigration requests for Afghan nationals and announced plans to re-examine green cards from ""19 high-risk countries,"" prompting concerns among Vermont's Afghan community of approximately 650 people. USCIS Director Joseph Edlow stated asylum decisions are stopped until ""every alien is vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible,"" while a previously obtained memo revealed Trump administration plans to review all refugees admitted since January 2021. Vermont's Afghan Alliance and Refugee Office condemned the attack but criticized the federal response as harmful and misinformed, emphasizing that refugees undergo extensive, multi-layered vetting. Advocates are mobilizing legal support and urging state leaders to ensure Afghan community members feel safe and welcome, arguing that one individual's actions should not target an entire group that contributed 21 years to U.S. missions. The policy impacts Vermont's workforce, where Afghans work in manufacturing, healthcare, engineering, and small businesses.",https://vtdigger.org/2025/12/02/immigrant-review-plan-following-d-c-shooting-raises-concerns-for-afghans-in-vermont/

National,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,Stateline,4 Republican states will help Homeland Security obtain driver’s license records,"The Trump administration has secured agreements from Florida, Indiana, Iowa, and Ohio to help access state driver's license data through the National Law Enforcement Telecommunications System (Nlets) to identify alleged noncitizen voters as part of its citizenship verification program (SAVE). The settlement requires DHS to continue developing SAVE, which has been repurposed to scan millions of state voter records, while the states pledge to support federal efforts to obtain full driver's license records through Nlets. Critics warn this creates a massive federal database that could enable surveillance or political targeting, while officials claim it ensures election integrity by verifying only eligible citizens vote. The Department of Justice has simultaneously demanded unredacted voter rolls from six mostly Democratic states and is sharing this data with Homeland Security. Democratic secretaries of state from twelve states have objected, arguing the modifications degrade election security and allow federal capture of sensitive voter data.",https://stateline.org/2025/12/01/4-republican-states-will-help-homeland-security-obtain-drivers-license-records/

DC,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,White House intensifies push for mass deportation after National Guard shooting,"President Trump accelerated efforts to curb legal immigration after an Afghan national granted asylum allegedly shot two National Guard members in Washington, D.C., killing one; the administration subsequently ended Temporary Protected Status for 330,000 Haitians, suspended all Afghan visa approvals, and ordered reexamination of green cards from 19 travel-ban countries. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt invoked the incident to justify completing a ""mass deportation operation,"" while DHS employed the far-right term ""remigrate"" advocating ethnic removal of non-white populations. The suspect had entered through a Biden-era special immigrant visa program but received asylum under Trump's administration earlier this year. The administration's asylum pause could last ""a long time"" despite legal questions about executive authority to suspend the 1980 Refugee Act. The shooting occurred as the administration fought a court order to remove over 2,000 National Guard troops deployed to the district.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/white-house-intensifies-push-mass-deportation-after-national-guard-shooting
