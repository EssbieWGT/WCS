Indiana,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,Indiana Capital Chronicle,Immigration crackdown bill continues Indiana Republican split,"Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita and Sen. Liz Brown are clashing over competing illegal immigration enforcement bills: Brown's SB76 permits state agencies to investigate unauthorized alien employment and report to federal authorities, while Rokita's SB122 would grant his office authority to seek court orders suspending employer operating licenses; the dispute, which includes Rokita's unsubstantiated claim that Brown blocked prior legislation due to a family member's immigration status, reflects tensions between enforcement efficacy and concerns about concentrating government power, as immigrant advocates warn both measures could incentivize discriminatory hiring practices.",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/2025/12/10/immigration-crackdown-bill-continues-indiana-republican-split/
Vermont,K-12 Education,VTDigger,Steven Gaarder: Moving Vermont school taxes into the modern era,"The Joint Fiscal Office projects a nearly 12% school property tax hike, prompting proposals to shift K-12 funding from property taxes to income taxes. The legislature has transferred money from the general fund to the education fund to mitigate this, a move the author supports as a gradual step. Sen. Vyhovsky (P/D-Chittenden Central) has proposed a bill to make this shift in one bold stroke, though the author prefers the incremental approach to address the regressive nature of property taxes on ""house poor"" residents.",https://vtdigger.org/2025/12/10/steven-gaarder-moving-vermont-school-taxes-into-the-modern-era/
Vermont,Public Health,VTDigger,Parents and providers fear Rutland Regional Medical Center’s planned pediatric closure would jeopardize patient health and drive up costs,"The Green Mountain Care Board may vote Dec. 12 or 17 to block Rutland Regional Medical Center's plan to close five pediatric inpatient beds, marking the first use of its newly granted authority under Act 68 to prevent hospital service reductions. The hospital cites low volume—169 days with zero overnight patients this year—and potential $500,000 savings, while 150+ parents and providers argue emergency department care is developmentally inappropriate and transfers to distant centers jeopardize safety. Policy concerns include added system costs from ambulance transport, family burdens, and EMS resource strain, particularly as the hospital faces a $17 million revenue drop from recent legislative changes. Board members questioned cost calculations that omitted Women and Children's Unit revenue and noted the closure conflicts with Vermont's broader 2028 healthcare transformation planning. The decision will determine whether rural pediatric inpatient care remains locally accessible or shifts to a model relying on extended ED stays and transfers to Burlington or Lebanon.",https://vtdigger.org/2025/12/09/parents-and-providers-fear-rutland-regional-medical-centers-planned-pediatric-closure-would-jeopardize-patient-health-and-drive-up-costs/

Connecticut,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,CT Mirror,CT multilingual student enrollment down; Advocates cite ICE fears,"Connecticut's English language learner enrollment fell by over 2,000 students this year—the first decline in more than a decade—with advocates blaming immigration enforcement fears under the Trump administration. A DataHaven survey revealed 31% of residents worry about immigration status, and 19% have avoided school or community activities. In response, districts like New Haven and Hartford have established ICE protocols and reinforced FERPA protections against data sharing with immigration authorities. Policy experts warn that fear-driven reductions in free/reduced lunch sign-ups could jeopardize federal funding through the Community Eligibility Provision. The simultaneous drop in chronic absenteeism among ELL students suggests the decline may reflect undocumented families leaving the state rather than improved school engagement.",https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/10/ct-multilingual-student-enrollment-immigration-fears/

Five American citizens testified about being stopped without provocation, subjected to physical violence, and detained for hours despite presenting identification and asserting their citizenship. DHS maintains that ICE does not arrest citizens and any arrests were for obstructing law enforcement, but witnesses vehemently disagreed. Blumenthal suggested federal legislation may be needed to prevent such incidents and hold the government accountable for rights violations.

This policy prioritizes homeowner tax relief over school district revenue, potentially affecting teacher salaries and educational resources.

The lost revenue also limited drought assistance for rural residents and shifted Medicaid costs to lower-income families.

The call reflects frustration with federal policy allowing telehealth prescribing of abortion medication, which the Supreme Court upheld in 2024 against anti-abortion groups' legal challenges. High-profile advocacy campaigns targeting government officials on abortion policy have historically preceded demonstrations and civil unrest. The dispute centers on a drug used in 63% of abortions, making it a focal point for political activism.

Circuit, arguing immigrants present less than two years lack constitutional due process protections. The Department of Justice contended Congress authorized the policy and courts lack jurisdiction, while immigrant rights groups and 19 Democratic state attorneys general challenged its constitutionality. Judges questioned whether the government must notify immigrants of their rights, with the administration claiming individuals must request special procedures themselves. The policy, a cornerstone of the administration's mass deportation campaign, allows removal without immigration judge review for those unable to prove extended U.S. residence.

The bill targets financial investments by school districts and the Biden administration in DEI programs that Tichenor claims failed to close achievement gaps for minority and economically disadvantaged students.

North Carolina,Public Health,NC Newsline,"A North Carolina hospital was slated to open in 2025. Mired in bureaucracy, it’s still a dirt field.","North Carolina's Certificate of Need law has delayed construction of a desperately needed rural hospital in western North Carolina for three years, leaving Madison County's 22,000 residents without local hospital access and only three ambulances that frequently travel over two hours to the nearest facility, creating public health emergencies when all units are simultaneously out of service. Despite the state health department identifying a need for 222 acute care beds in the region, Mission Health's legal challenges have prevented AdventHealth from building the Weaverville facility. The CON law, originally intended to prevent unnecessary healthcare expansion, is now being used to block competition and maintain HCA Healthcare's regional monopoly.
