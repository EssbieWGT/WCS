Montana,Immigration and Immigration Enforcement,Daily Montanan,"If Washington won’t rein in ICE, our communities must","The article criticizes ICE as a bloated $45 billion agency that primarily detains non-violent immigrants rather than dangerous criminals, noting that Montana banned state law enforcement from purchasing warrantless cell phone data in May 2025—a measure the authors urge all states to adopt; it advocates for state and local governments to prosecute ICE misconduct, restrict agent operations near schools and hospitals, and use zoning laws to block detention facilities, while highlighting that private prison companies earn $1.5 billion annually from detaining over 107,000 people, most without criminal records; the authors call for divestment from these companies and demand citizen action to hold local officials accountable for countering ICE's ""immoral and unconstitutional overreach.""",https://dailymontanan.com/2025/12/09/if-washington-wont-rein-in-ice-our-communities-must/
Wyoming,State Budget,WyoFile,Beware of budget cuts that envision churches in charge of social safety net,"Rep. John Bear, co-chairman of the Joint Appropriations Committee, and the Wyoming Freedom Caucus are targeting the Department of Health's $2.2 billion biennial budget for significant cuts. Bear has appointed a subcommittee to examine the department's budget and has expressed intentions to shift some health and welfare responsibilities to churches. The potential cuts could be devastating to health services in Wyoming. The Appropriations Committee will continue its budget review through the next legislative session starting February 9.

Wyoming,Public Health,WyoFile,Wyoming health department pitches ‘BearCare’ for medical emergencies. Lawmakers are skeptical.,"The Wyoming Department of Health proposed ""BearCare,"" a state-operated emergency health plan for members paying monthly dues to address catastrophic medical costs amid the nation's highest Obamacare premium increases, while also seeking federal funds to stabilize hospitals and improve access to OB-GYN, maternity, and ambulance services. Lawmakers on the Joint Appropriations Committee expressed strong skepticism about the program's sustainability, costs, and government role, with concerns it would create unsustainable programs and force an income tax, which health officials denied. The plan would initially rely on up to $800 million from the federal Rural Health Transformation Program before becoming self-funded, but federal guidelines would likely prohibit alternatives like a hospital perpetuity fund suggested by critics. Only one legislator supported the proposal, arguing it would help small businesses, while the Freedom Caucus pledged budget cuts to pre-pandemic levels during ongoing hearings. The proposal reflects state efforts to transform rural healthcare but faces significant political opposition over its design and fiscal implications.",https://wyofile.com/wyoming-health-department-pitches-bearcare-for-medical-emergencies-lawmakers-are-skeptical/

Enforcement actions included a midsummer blitz in Ambridge, August restaurant worker arrests, and efforts to enlist local law enforcement and deport Guatemalan children, though some initiatives were reversed or stalled by courts and public inquiries.

The controversy over potential war crimes, shifting explanations from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, and his separate ""Signalgate"" scandal could spark public protests demanding transparency and accountability.

Connecticut,State Budget,CT Mirror,Borrowing for transportation on Lamont’s chopping block,"Connecticut's Special Transportation Fund faces projected insolvency by 2029 due to stagnant fuel and sales tax revenues, forcing the Lamont administration to propose reducing transportation borrowing from $1.4 billion to $1.1 billion annually by 2027-28; revenue forecasts have been revised downward from an expected 4.5% growth ($84 million) to nearly flat growth (less than $6 million) over the next three years, while the General Fund maintains unprecedented surpluses averaging $1.8 billion annually, with approximately $10 billion since 2020 directed toward pension debt reduction, leaving Connecticut with $33 billion in remaining pension obligations. This creates a policy tension between Lamont's priority of aggressive pension debt paydown and calls from legislators like Sen. Christine Cohen and business groups to adjust budget allocations to preserve transportation infrastructure investments, with the administration's February 4 budget proposal expected to spark considerable debate over whether to modify pension payment strategies or reallocate General Fund resources to sustain transportation construction funding.",https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/08/ct-transportation-borrowing/

These actions align with U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s anti-vaccine agenda and reflect growing political influence on federal scientific recommendations. Griffin's ""pro-informed consent"" philosophy and alignment with Governor Jeff Landry's COVID-19 vaccine opposition demonstrate how partisan positions are shaping state and federal disease prevention strategies.
