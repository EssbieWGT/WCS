To do her part in making sure that doesn’t happen, Caín-Yuqilema kept her Kichwa language alive in the classrooms of Michigan State University by sharing it with community members.
“Kichwa is an endangered language, and if it ever disappears, it will be because of us: from the language not being passed down by parents to the change in traditional clothing. I believe that in Ecuador, we lack appreciation for ourselves, we Kichwa speakers,” she said.

Caín-Yuqilema, 32, arrived at MSU from Ecuador a year ago, as part of a cultural and academic exchange through the Fulbright Program. Elsita, as her friends affectionately call her, embarked on this adventure once again outside her country, but this time not just as an exchange student, but also as a teacher of her culture.
Through engaging classes and cultural events, Caín-Yuqilema taught Kichwa, her first language and the native tongue of the Andean peoples in South America, to undergraduate students. At the same time, alongside Indigenous student organizations, she organized cultural events for community members, never missing an opportunity to showcase a piece of the Indigenous traditions of Ecuador that she grew up with and lived with.
Caín-Yuqilema has a soft and calm voice. Filling her voice with warm emotion, she shared how the MSU community has appreciated and admired every part of her culture. Every Kichwa word spoken in class, every song shared at a cultural event, is a thread she wove, connecting the two worlds: the Indigenous traditions of Ecuador and the American society.
Among her students, words of excitement and gratitude are expressed at having learned about a new culture through language. They appreciated that these types of classes are offered at the university, where cultural exchange and the expansion of perspectives are encouraged through native-speaking professors from other countries.
“I looked through the MSU catalog and saw that Kichwa was being taught in person, so I was really excited to see that and kind of jumped at the opportunity to start learning. I’m so, so happy that I did. I didn’t have much of a connection with Ecuador or any other South American country. I do now.”, said Drake Howard, a linguistics student.
“We’re really lucky at MSU to be able to take courses in a language that doesn’t have very many resources online,” Howard highlighted.

This process of cultural exchange made her feel much more confident about her own culture. Caín-Yuqilema belongs to the Kichwa Puruhá ethnic group, from the region of Riobamba, in the province of Chimborazo, Ecuador. She learned Kichwa from her family, passed down by her parents and grandparents, while Spanish, her second language, was taught at school and in the community. Later, as a young woman, she learned English at university.
Although English and Spanish are the dominant languages in Ecuador, Kichwa has remained within her as her own. Caín-Yuqilema explained that it is common to see young people who no longer know the native language or wear traditional clothing. For many Kichwa speakers, not speaking Spanish “properly,” as a second language, makes them subject to uncomfortable stares and corrections, even in their own country.
“After several decades of struggle by our fathers and mothers, fortunately in Ecuador, Kichwa has been more accepted by society in recent years; however, there is still much work to do,” Caín-Yuqilema said.

According to UNESCO, in Andean countries with a Kichwa majority, such as Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador, there is an accelerated loss of the language, primarily due to migration and the death of speakers. Furthermore, the low appreciation for culture and language means it is not passed down from generation to generation, driven by social and cultural integration in places where Spanish is the dominant language.
Despite being a vulnerable language, Kichwa, more than just a language, has become a cultural bridge that connects Indigenous roots with international academic spaces, including in Michigan. Caín-Yuqilema built and maintained that bridge by bringing with her her words, her clothing, her stories, and her worldview to the MSU community members who may have never heard about the lives of Andean peoples in South America.
“Kichwa education brought me here, and this experience has been a learning experience. I’m taking the best of education and culture from here, and I hope I’ve left the best of mine,” Caín-Yuqilema stated.

Phil Scott says he’d veto S.131, but his reasons to do so make no sense.Scott says he opposes S.131 because Burlington bar owners could enforce it and Burlington would be the only community in the state having such a ban, and because S.131 wouldn’t fix Burlington’s violence problem. First, police would enforce the new law, just as they enforce any law — e.g., speed limits, stop signs, drunk driving, etc. Bar owners can’t afford metal detectors and don’t want those machines anyway because they send the wrong message to patrons (that violence is so bad in Burlington that metal detectors are needed).Second, Burlington wants and needs S.131: the voters, the mayor and police chief, and bar owners, for good reasons, especially with Burlington’s disturbing uptick in violence. S.131 isn’t designed to fix Burlington’s citywide violence, just the potential for violence around sensitive places such as bars and restaurants serving alcohol. The homicide on Church Street last August just outside the Red Square Bar shows how important S.131 is. READ MORE
Furthermore, laws don’t eliminate crime: they set reasonable limits with clear consequences and hold scofflaws accountable.

He’s trying to have his cake and eat it, too, with senseless logic, as if to say, “I don’t support S.131 because it doesn’t go far enough, but even if it did, I’d oppose it, too.”Again, his view makes no sense. “The good is the enemy of the perfect, but I oppose both.”I’d like to ask the governor to imagine he’s in a bar relaxing after a stressful day & disturbance erupts. Fists fly, pool cues are snapped over the billiard table and glass scatters across the floor. How would he feel being in there knowing guns were okay in the bar?Stupid things can happen in bars and, as the tragedy last August shows, they can be fatal when guns are involved. Guns and alcohol are a bad mix.Scott is wrong to oppose S.131 and his reasons fail to show he cares enough for the safety of Burlington’s citizens, period.Sincerely,Bob Williamson (founding member of Gun Sense Vermont)South WoodstockRead the story on VTDigger here:  Bob Williamson: Gov.

[…]","A payday advance neon sign is seen in this undated photo. (Photo by EHStock/Getty Images)On the 120th and last day of Alaska’s annual legislative session, the state House passed a bill that would curb high interest rates and fees for payday loans of $25,000 or less. 
The Senate passed Senate Bill 35 in late April, and the House passed the bill Tuesday by a vote of 24 to 16. The bill now is set to be transmitted to Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s desk.
If the bill becomes law, it would remove payday lenders from an exemption in state lending laws and cap interest rates and fees at an annual percentage rate, or APR, of 36% for loans of $25,000 or less. 
Anchorage Democrats Sen. Forrest Dunbar and Rep. Ted Eischeid sponsored the legislation in the Senate and House. 
“This bill closes a harmful special exemption that has allowed lenders to charge outrageous interest rates on small loans,” Dunbar said in a statement after the vote. “With this change, Alaskans will have the same consumer protections that apply to other loans, reducing the risk of debt traps and keeping more money in our communities.”
An estimated 15,000 Alaskans take out a payday loan each year, according to research by the nonprofit Alaska Public Interest Research Group. Payday loans are short-term, high-cost loans, often for small amounts that are meant to be paid back on the borrower’s next pay day. Interest rates can range from 194% to 521%, and advocates of the bill said it’s a consumer protection measure that could help borrowers avoid becoming trapped in a cycle of debt and repayment of more payday loans. 
“Instead of fixing a problem, this exception to the Small Loans Act has been more like giving a thirsty person a glass of salt water,” Eischeid said on the House floor ahead of the vote. “It doesn’t help in the long term.”
Eischeid pointed to the Military Lending Act, which already established a cap at 36% total annual percentage rate for loans to military service personnel. 
“Veterans, on the other hand, do not have similar protections and are targeted by payday lenders and are vulnerable to these excessive fees and interests,” Eischeid said. “We should provide safeguards in the marketplace, so Alaskans aren’t the victims. It’s time to remove the loophole to payday loans and protect Alaskan families from predatory lending practices.” 
Rep. Jamie Allard, R-Eagle River, opposed the bill. 
“This is government overreach. Individuals should be able to take loans as they wish, at whatever percentage rate. And frankly, there’s credit cards that have a higher interest rate than what we’re doing right now, today, and I don’t see that in this bill,” she said. 
High interest loans can present dilemmas regarding governance and oversight. One day after the Legislature passed the bill, the Anchorage Daily News and ProPublica published an investigation spotlighting a tribal lending business, Minto Money, based in the small community of Minto outside Fairbanks. The story details how online lending at high interest rates is highly lucrative, but highlights ethical concerns, community divisions and questions around who benefits. 
While the company does not lend to people in Alaska, the investigation found, there is an effort to attract other Alaska villages to the lending industry. 
“Tribes in America are in demand as business partners because they can claim that, as sovereign entities, their operations are exempt from state interest rate caps,” the authors wrote. “Critics of such lending partnerships have called them ‘rent-a-tribe.’”
Dunbar said the legislation was developed before he became aware of the lender. He responded to the story’s findings in an email on Friday. “I applaud the investigative coverage of the ADN/ProPublica on a particular payday lender who appears to have engaged in the kind of practices that highlight why reform was necessary. Without clear limits, too many Alaskans have faced a lack of safe borrowing options and have often been left with only predatory choices.”
He said it’s notable that every registered payday lending company that operates in Alaska is based outside of the state, and the vast majority of these transactions are done online. The bill includes a provision to prevent companies from evading state interest-rate caps.
“I am glad that the bill included an anti-evasion clause and provisions to limit ‘rent-a-bank’ practices,” Dunbar said. 
Once transmitted to Dunleavy, he has 20 days excluding Sundays to sign the bill, veto it or allow it to become law without his signature.

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)Three years after lawmakers put $1 million toward advocacy efforts for children in the court system statewide, two revived nonprofits are starting to support children again.
Volunteers with local Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA) programs advocate for children who’ve been removed from their families and placed in state care due to suspected abuse and neglect. The volunteers meet with the children and other contacts, such as teachers, therapists and caseworkers. They also write reports to judges about the children’s needs, strengths and interests.
“This process is crucial as it gives the child a voice in the legal proceedings concerning their welfare,” said CASA state director Sara Kelly in an emailed statement. 
Over 330 CASA volunteers worked with 658 children in 37 counties last year, according to the state Unified Judicial System. Most of the state’s 1,049 active cases involving CASA last year — with or without a volunteer — were in the Sioux Falls and Rapid City areas.
This is the first time in 16 years that the state has operated CASA organizations in all of its circuit courts. The Sixth Circuit, in central South Dakota, and the Fifth Circuit, representing northeastern South Dakota, closed in 2009.
Federal cut to children’s advocacy funding ‘abandons American children,’ says SD nonprofit leader

Gloria Hutson, in Aberdeen, was hired to lead the reestablished Fifth Circuit CASA in November last year. She told the state CASA Commission at its Wednesday meeting that three counties within her 10-county jurisdiction have a high case volume: Brown, Walworth and Spink counties.
“The focus these last six months has been on building a solid, sustainable structure while building deep community roots,” Hutson said.
Walworth County has a “disproportionate” number of cases for its population, and many involve the Indian Child Welfare Act, Hutson said. The federal Indian Child Welfare Act sets minimum standards for efforts to reunite tribal children in the state’s custody with their families. Walworth county is adjacent to the Standing Rock and Cheyenne River reservations.
As of the end of April, Walworth County had 25 pending cases involving 52 children. Brown County had 32 cases involving 58 children and Spink County had three cases involving three children.
Fifty-seven cases were active in the Fifth Circuit last year, and none of the children had CASA representation, according to UJS. Through April this year, the circuit had 61 pending cases involving 117 children, Hutson said.
Most of those children still do not have CASA volunteers advocating for them. Fifth Circuit CASA has eight volunteers so far, two of whom are advocating for three children. All the children are younger than 2 years old.
Laurie Gill, a former state Department of Social Services secretary who now works with Maxwell Strategy Group, leads CASA for the Sixth Circuit. Gill’s firm was hired to lead the nonprofit, and Gill said the contract was renewed recently by the nonprofit’s board of directors.
Sixth Circuit CASA, which represents 14 counties in central South Dakota, including Hughes County and the state capital city of Pierre, intends to train 10 volunteers this year. The first will be sworn in and assigned cases by June, Gill said.
Thirty-nine cases were active in the Sixth Circuit last year. There were 45 pending cases involving 94 children at the end of April, Gill said. Most are in the Pierre/Fort Pierre area.
The 2022 funding from the Legislature was a result of lawmakers learning about the holes in South Dakota’s CASA coverage, after loosening a requirement to appoint advocates for abused and neglected children in the court system. Lawmakers on the state budget committee approved funding to help restart the two shuttered programs and help existing CASA programs expand.
The Fifth and Sixth Circuit organizations have each received $120,000 so far.
Another $143,715was awarded to most other CASA programs. 
The need for volunteers remains one of the biggest challenges for CASA nonprofits across the state, leaders told the commission. Since last year’s report, the number of volunteers has dropped from 330 statewide to 318.
National CASA guidelines require one staff member to supervise a maximum of 30 volunteers. Each volunteer is assigned one case at a time, typically staying with a case until it’s resolved.
The Sioux Falls CASA reports 333 children currently on the waiting list to be represented by a volunteer. The Seventh Circuit CASA in Rapid City reports 455 children on its waiting list.



The 2022 Legislature appropriated $1 million to the Unified Judicial System to award South Dakota CASA nonprofits with grants to rebuild or expand. About $384,000 – less than 40% of the funds – have been spent so far:

$120,000 to the Fifth Circuit CASA in Aberdeen
$120,000 to the Sixth Circuit CASA in Pierre
$58,400 to the Southeast CASA in Yankton
$40,835 to the First Circuit CASA in Mitchell
$25,000 to the East Central CASA in Brookings
$15,000 to the Sioux Falls Area CASA
$2,000 to the Seventh Circuit CASA in Rapid City

State legislators on Friday halted hundreds of bills with new spending attached from advancing. Why? The Legislature again underwent its relatively opaque process known as the “suspense file.” Hanging over lawmakers’ heads is the expected $12 billion state budget deficit that is projected to worsen due to federal tariffs and increased state health care spending.
The Assembly and Senate’s appropriations committees hold these proceedings twice a year. As CalMatters’ Jeanne Kuang and Yue Stella Yu explain, 32% of 1,098 measures were held in the committees on Friday — meaning those proposals are essentially dead or shelved for the year. 

Assemblymember Buffy Wicks, an Oakland Democrat and chairperson of the Assembly appropriations committee: “Many good bills are going to fall by the wayside today. We are not in a year where we can be expanding programs, developing new offices, new agencies, new departments and expanding our footprints.”

The Assembly trimmed about the same number of bills compared to last May, while the Senate squashed a slightly higher percentage of bills (29% compared to 25.5% in 2024), according to longtime lobbyist Chris Micheli.
Some notable bills that didn’t advance included ones that would have expanded health care services, such as a proposal to seek federal approval to cover some housing services under Medi-Cal, an insurance program for low-income residents, and another to allow more Medi-Cal patients to receive home-based care.
Two crime bills, both introduced by Republicans, were also spiked. One would have barred some prisoners from being released early through the state’s elderly parole program, and the other would have increased penalties for giving fentanyl to minors.
But the committees did pass 742 other bills, including a proposal by Assemblymember Rick Zbur and backed by Gov. Gavin Newsom to expand tax credits for the state’s film industry. Though language to increase the state’s film tax credit to $750 million annually was struck from the bill, the specific amount is expected to be ironed out during budget negotiations, said Zbur, a Los Angeles Democrat.
The bills that survived on Friday will face another hurdle next week, when they must advance out of the chamber — Assembly or Senate — where they were introduced.

Big state deficits through 2029

The nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office agrees with the Newsom administration that the state is “likely to face persistent future deficits” which are expected to range from $10 billion to $20 billion through the next four years.The latest number-crunching by the analyst’s office dropped Saturday, a typical occurrence that follows the governor’s unveiling earlier this month of his updated state budget plan, which also projected years of operating deficits in the tens of billions.
One of Newsom’s key proposals to help reduce spending and plug the budget hole is to limit new Medi-Cal recipients, particularly freezing enrollment for adult immigrants who do not have permanent legal status. The office recommends that the Legislature should “maintain at least the level of ongoing solutions” as proposed by the governor, but could adopt “additional solutions” in anticipation of future deficits.
Some bit of good news: Because of slightly higher revenue estimates, the analyst’s office projects that this year’s budget condition will improve by nearly $2 billion compared to the administration’s assessment. But uncertain “federal budget changes” are likely to add more financial pressures on the state, according to the office.All this info will shape the discussions between lawmakers and Newsom as they craft a budget deal for the next year by late June. 



How federal budget bill could impact Medi-Cal

Speaking of “federal budget changes” the Republican-led U.S. House of Representatives last week advanced a budget package that could have major effects on millions of low-income Californians enrolled in Medicaid. 
Nationally, the bill guts Medicaid spending by $700 billion, which could lead to California losing as much as $20 billion a year and 217,000 jobs, according to an April analysis by the UC Berkeley Labor Center. 
To reduce costs, the bill proposes cutting funding for states that provide coverage to immigrants without legal status, which would affect California. It would also limit the number of new enrollees by imposing proof of work hours. 
About 15 million Californians are on Medi-Cal, the state’s implementation of Medicaid. But roughly 29% of Medi-Cal recipients are unable to work due to caregiving responsibilities, school, having a disability or other reasons. The new work requirements could jeopardize coverage for as many as 3.5 million Californians according to a Center on Budget and Policy Priorities analysis.
The House advanced the bill with all 43 California Democrats voting against it and all nine GOP members — who represent a total of 2.5 million Medi-Cal enrollees — voting for it. At least one right-leaning group in California says the cuts are warranted to curb federal spending.
The U.S. Senate has to approve the bill, but some GOP senators say the bill doesn’t cut enough to address the national debt.

The net effect of this bill would disenfranchise Vermont property taxpayers, shifting their Town Meeting Day power at the ballot box to future Legislatures in Montpelier.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Sen. Thomas Chittenden: Freedom and Unity in our education system.","This commentary is by Sen. Thomas Chittenden, D-Chittenden Southeast.This session of the Legislature has been intensely focused on education reform. Our current education financing system, implemented in the ‘90s, drew inspiration from the Vermont Supreme Court decision often referred to as “Brigham.”Brigham has loomed large in this current debate and is fundamentally grounded in Section 68 of our state constitution, which states that “a competent number of schools ought to be maintained in each town unless the general assembly permits other provisions for the convenient instruction of youth.”Our constitution clearly recognizes the distinct roles of towns and the state in delivering public education. It does not lay the direct responsibility to educate our kids on the state; rather, it recognizes each town’s responsibility to maintain “a competent number of schools” and leaves it to those towns to determine what constitutes competency.Simultaneously, it empowers the General Assembly to make “provisions for the convenient instruction of youth.” This recognizes a need for balance between local control (freedom) and centralized state oversight (unity).As the Brigham decision concluded, “Equal opportunity does not necessarily require precisely equal per capita expenditures, nor does it necessarily prohibit cities and towns from spending more on education if they choose, but it does not allow a system in which educational opportunity is necessarily a function of district wealth.”An education foundation formula is a common mechanism used in other states to ensure a baseline of educational quality while allowing districts to spend above that. However, the current education transformation bill passed by the House does not align with this principle. It establishes a “foundation” equal to or exceeding current spending levels, essentially becoming the “whole house” rather than a “foundation.”READ MORE
I am not convinced that what this bill contemplates is what Vermont wants. I am not convinced that Vermont wants Montpelier dictating education spending throughout Vermont with a uniform property tax rate for the whole state to fund a Montpelier-defined level of spending.This would represent far too much unity and not enough freedom, concentrating power in Montpelier, and putting in place a system where future Legislatures, rather than local property owners and parents, would set spending and tax levels for our schools. I do not support this degree of power consolidation to the Statehouse — not this year nor in future years.This proposed legislation drastically tips the balance from local control (freedom) towards state control (unity) in ways I do not support. As Ethan Allen noted, “The Gods of the Valley are Not the Gods of the Hills,” highlighting Vermont’s diverse values and priorities.Our lived experiences in Canaan differ from those in Colchester, and these differences are naturally reflected in how we educate our kids (among other things). Our approaches and priorities will diverge, and our systems must respect this diversity to the greatest extent possible — which our state constitution clearly does.What I do support is consolidating the number of our school districts (119) to reduce administrative overhead, achieve economies of scale, enhance curricular depth and increase consistency for our kids across Vermont. And I support the timeline for this work outlined in the House bill, with a clear understanding that elementary schools, vital community centers, should not be closed.Kindergarten through fifth grade students need nearby schools with short bus rides. However, we can improve middle and high school delivery through more rational design and district consolidation, offering greater curricular depth with 21st-century facilities.And what I do support is to reinstate strong spending controls using the currently dormant  allowable growth spending caps on local districts starting with fiscal year 2027. Coupled with lowering our excess spending threshold penalty to be below the allowable cap, this would be a much less invasive mechanism than what is contemplated in H.454 to drive down education spending without silencing the community voice.Our current system, despite its imperfections, maintains a balance between freedom and unity. We simply need to apply more unity using existing tools and more rational school district governance to reduce spending, achieve efficiencies and improve curricular depth and consistency. We are paying too much in property taxes, and I believe we are overspending on education for a continually declining student population. To lower property taxes, we must calibrate our school offerings and reduce spending to match our shrinking student numbers. I do not believe the high foundation formula in H.454 will achieve this, either next year or in five years.The net effect of this bill would disenfranchise Vermont property taxpayers, shifting their Town Meeting Day power at the ballot box to future Legislatures in Montpelier. These future legislatures would then determine education funding levels, rather than allowing each town to define what constitutes “competent” education. The gods of the hills are not the gods of the valley, so towns need to be deeming that — not Montpelier.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Sen.

(Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)After nearly a month, the Eaton and Palisades wildfires that ravaged California have been contained. But for Southern California and state agencies, another challenge lies ahead: Helping people find homes.
The wildfires levied significant long-term damage, with thousands of homes destroyed, billions in damages and a worsening of the state’s housing and homelessness crises. Even before the fires, California already had a shortage of 1.2 million affordable homes, with Los Angeles County alone facing a deficit of 500,000 units.
“This tragic loss will certainly make the housing crisis more acute in multiple ways,” said Ryan Finnigan, an associate research director at the Terner Center for Housing Innovation at the University of California, Berkeley. “L.A. continues to need vastly more affordable housing, and people displaced from lost affordable units might need the most support to become stably housed again.”
Even those displaced from market-rate or high-end housing will face challenges in an already tight market, with thousands searching for housing at once — likely driving prices even higher for everyone.
Natural disasters are worsening the U.S. housing crisis, upending the home insurance market, and reducing housing options — particularly for lower-income residents. And that trend will likely grow as disasters become more frequent and severe.
 

Climate change, experts warn, is the world’s fastest-growing driver of homelessness, displacing millions of people annually. In 2022 alone, disasters forced 32.6 million people worldwide from their homes, according to a 2023 report by the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre.
If trends continue, 1.2 billion people globally could be displaced due to disasters by 2050, according to the international think tank Institute for Economics & Peace.
The consequences are already playing out.
After the 2023 Maui wildfires, homelessness in Hawaii rose by 87%. With Los Angeles’ fires destroying about six times as many homes, experts predict that California’s homeless population will surge dramatically in 2025.
“Natural disasters cause a massive spike in homelessness,” said Jeremy Ney, a macroeconomics policy strategist who studies American inequality. “The primary goal of relief organizations like the Red Cross is to prevent people from becoming permanently unhoused — but for many, it can take a decade or more to recover.”
  A long path to recovery 

According to the Migration Policy Institute, 3.2 million U.S. adults were displaced or evacuated because of natural disasters in 2022, with more than 500,000 still unable to return home by the end of the year.
The recovery timeline can be grueling. In North Carolina, state officials managing Hurricane Helene’s recovery warned that key federal funding for home reconstruction could be delayed for months — possibly into next fall, according to NC Newsline.
In the event of a disaster, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, known as FEMA, focuses on shorter-term relief, offering emergency shelters, disaster unemployment assistance and grants for rebuilding. State agencies, though, are tasked with the long-term projects, such as making infrastructure repairs and developing housing initiatives, said Samantha Batko, a senior fellow in the Housing and Communities Division at the Urban Institute.
“Disaster relief programs like FEMA focus on short-term recovery, whereas homelessness response systems struggle with long-term systemic challenges,” said Batko. “People who live in unsheltered places during disasters, like on street corners or in cars, have higher exposure to ash [from fires] and debris, which leads to more health issues and emergency room visits.”
 

At the time of the Eaton fire, Los Angeles’ Skid Row was home to roughly 2,200 unsheltered people, experiencing some of the worst air quality effects, according to Batko, who co-authored a report on the issue for the institute.
Los Angeles’ homelessness crisis was already dire: Last year, Los Angeles County had just 27,000 shelter beds for 75,000 unhoused residents. The fires have now left thousands more without homes, further straining an already overwhelmed system.
“The relevant governments — state and federal agencies, L.A. County and its 88 cities — must be on the same page to mount an organized and effective response,” said Finnigan, of the Terner Center for Housing Innovation.
There may be another twist coming.
When President Donald Trump visited western North Carolina last month, he floated the idea of eliminating FEMA and leaving disaster response to the states, with federal reimbursement of some costs. He has since signed an executive order calling for a full assessment of FEMA and recommendations for “improvements or structural changes.” State emergency managers quickly responded that they need FEMA’s involvement.
  Insurance challenges 

Disaster recovery is not equal: Homeowners with insurance typically rebound the fastest, as policies cover much of the rebuilding costs. But as climate disasters intensify, the insurance market has begun to unravel. In 2023, insurers lost money on homeowners’ coverage in 18 states — more than a third of the country — according to a New York Times analysis.
It’s led to an insurance crisis — rising premiums, reduced coverage or insurers pulling out altogether — a trend that began in California, Florida and Louisiana but that has spread across the country.
Even before this winter’s fires, these insurance issues would have been a defining legislative issue for California, predicted Alexandra Alvarado, director of education and marketing at the American Apartment Owners Association, an industry lobbying group.
“There’s a great anxiety from … property owners on whether they will be insured or covered when another wildfire or a similar event costs them their home, and whether it’s worth it to rebuild and start over,” Alvarado told Stateline in December. “I think it’s going to be on the radar of lawmakers not just in our state, because we’re seeing this play out in other states as well.”
 

During the fires, California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara reminded insurers of their legal duty to cover mudslide damage caused by recent wildfires, as colder, wetter weather raises risks, particularly for Los Angeles County wildfire survivors.
Already, State Farm, the largest home insurer in California, has asked the state to approve “emergency” rate hikes because of the fires, seeking an average 22% increase for homeowners and 15% for renters.
  Barriers for lower-income residents 

The long-term recovery process is filled with hurdles — especially for low-income and marginalized communities.
Lower-income households are disproportionately vulnerable to climate disasters; they’re also disproportionately harmed. Residents may reside in older, high-risk homes that are more susceptible to destruction. In some places, lower-income neighborhoods were built in low-lying flood plains because land was cheaper or red-lining kept families of color from living elsewhere.
Many households cannot afford homeowners or flood insurance, and strict eligibility criteria may prevent them from qualifying for disaster relief loans, said Katie Arrington, a disaster recovery expert for Boulder County, Colorado.




Natural disasters cause a massive spike in homelessness.


– Jeremy Ney, a macroeconomics policy strategist



Renters, mobile home residents and uninsured households often can’t afford homes comparable to the ones lost to disaster. Without financial safety nets, many displaced residents face an impossible choice: endure months or years of instability, or leave their community altogether.
“People with insurance have an easier time recovering than people without it. Homeowners, in general, recover more easily than renters,” Arrington said. “There’s a spectrum, from homeowners with full insurance to renters without insurance, and each group faces very different recovery timelines.”
One major barrier to recovery for renters is the post-disaster surge in housing costs. A Brookings Institution report published in October 2023 shows that effective rents typically rise 4% after a disaster and remain elevated for at least five years.
In the past few weeks in Los Angeles, fire-affected neighborhoods such as Venice and Santa Monica saw rents surge by 60-100% within days, fueling calls for stronger enforcement of California’s anti-price gouging laws.
California lawmakers in January allocated billions in funding to state and federal government relief efforts and put an immediate moratorium on evictions. The governor’s office also has issued an executive order prohibiting Los Angeles-area landlords from evicting tenants who provide shelter to survivors of the Los Angeles-area firestorms.
  Experience and luck 

For many municipalities, past experience is the only real preparation for disaster recovery. And sometimes, a bit of luck helps, too.
In 2021, the Marshall Fire in Colorado forced the evacuation of 35,000 residents in Boulder County and destroyed nearly 1,000 buildings. County officials say their response benefited from both preparation and circumstance.
“Some of our success was due to experience, but some of it was luck. We had a vacant county-owned building available to house the disaster assistance center, which allowed us to act quickly,” said Arrington, the disaster response manager for Boulder County. “If we had needed to rent or find a less-central location, the response would have been slower.”
 

Across the U.S., states are grappling with similar challenges.
In North Carolina, state-led efforts such as the Back@Home program helped rapidly rehouse approximately 100 displaced households after Hurricane Florence in 2018, and later helped nearly 800 households find more permanent homes. The program has since become a model for addressing disaster-fueled displacement.
Similarly, after Tropical Storm Helene last fall, Asheville, North Carolina, allocated $1 million in rental assistance to prevent displacement. While Red Cross and state-run shelters were scheduled to close by Nov. 10, the city coordinated with the WNC Rescue Mission to keep one shelter open longer for the remaining displaced residents.
By Dec. 31, 2024, all nine remaining shelter participants had secured exit plans — ensuring no one was left without a place to go, according to the city’s spokesperson, Kim Miller.
Hawaii also has launched large-scale relief initiatives. In response to the 2023 Maui fire, HomeAid Hawaii, in partnership with the state, developed interim housing solutions for 1,500 displaced residents for up to five years.
“Disaster-driven homelessness requires targeted programs that meet the needs of people at risk,” said Batko, of the Urban Institute. “States must integrate housing policy into emergency preparedness, or they’ll find themselves overwhelmed when the next disaster strikes.”
In Colorado, Boulder County has managed to rebuild or begin construction on about two-thirds of the homes that were lost.
Boulder County is aiming for an ambitious 90% recovery rate, meaning 9 of 10 displaced households will find a new homes in the area. But even that success comes with a twinge of mourning for what was lost.
“We started this recovery with a goal to get close to 90%, so we’re proud,” Arrington said. “But we also recognize that some parts of the community have changed forever.”

The state can help but its resources are limited.,"Guest Commentary written by

Mary Benson
Mary Benson is a Lake County real estate broker who operated a small water system at Clear Lake with her husband


We all know of mom-and-pop shops run by couples who share the workload and, if lucky, become integral to the communities they serve. 
Until recently my husband, Norm Benson, and I were mom-and-pop operators of a water treatment and distribution system at Clear Lake, an idyllic, nutrient-rich version of a green Lake Tahoe, about 110 miles north of San Francisco. 
We love our community and didn’t mind pitching in.
Over the years our mutual water system, the Crescent Bay Improvement Co., has become unsustainable. Our treated lake water could not meet state or federal drinking standards. 
We could boil it for cooking and use it in bathrooms and for laundry. But the 24 households and businesses hooked up to our system had to rely on bottled water for drinking. 
The state and a much larger water company in recent years threw us a lifeline, for which we are grateful. By the time we got help, our water hadn’t been drinkable for years.
We were hardly alone. More than 400 water systems, serving 885,000 Californians, are failing across the state, the State Water Resources Control Board reports.  More than half those failing systems are in disadvantaged communities, and two-thirds serve mostly people of color. 
The reasons for these failures range from poor water quality or limited water availability, to a lack of affordability for consumers or technical management issues. 
It’s also deeply concerning that more than 1,000 additional water systems, serving more than 3 million Californians, are also at risk or are potentially at risk of failure.
California was the first state to declare that clean drinking water is a human right in 2012. As with so much in life, however, rights don’t necessarily come with guarantees.
Norm and I shouldered enormous responsibilities to keep water flowing to our customers.
As the daily treatment plant operator, Norm lugged heavy bags of diatomaceous earth — used to remove unwanted material from drinking water —  up and down 152 steps, between the road and our lakeside plant. 
California does have far-sighted policies in place to help and is keeping watch over the needs of small struggling systems like ours was. Mary Benson
When he entered his 70s we tried to hire help, but there were no takers. Applicants took one look at those 152 steps and shook their heads.
Although my profession is real estate, I got a water treatment license to manage our system. I volunteered, since our community’s $30,000 budget didn’t include my salary.  
Work weeks were endless. Day trips were cut short by broken pipes or other emergencies in our aging system, dating back to 1935. Infrastructure upgrades were out of reach. 
State-mandated fire hydrants and water meters were nonexistent and unattainable for our system. Hydrants require 6-inch pipes; our system has 2-inch pipes. 
As bleak as this sounds, it turned out there was hope. In 2019, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a law that would channel hundreds of millions of dollars yearly into improving failing water systems, including through consolidations with larger systems, as would happen for us. 
This “Safe and Affordable Funding for Equity and Resilience” (SAFER) program helped facilitate the acquisition of our system in July 2023 by the Golden State Water Co., which operates 40 water systems across California. 
Now Golden State is doing what we could not — making investments to ensure a safe, clean, reliable drinking water infrastructure. 
Since SAFER, the state’s Water Resources Control Board has distributed more than $800 million to disadvantaged areas. More than 250 systems are no longer failing. About 100,000 Californians are benefiting from state-facilitated consolidations like ours.
As hopeful as these numbers are, the needs still dwarf the resources. 
Costs to upgrade failing wells and water systems are high — an estimated $11.5 billion over five years. The board anticipates a worrisome shortfall of $5 billion in grant funding. 
Even so, we know California does have far-sighted policies in place to help and is keeping watch over the needs of small struggling systems like ours was.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/090424_Water-Quality-LV_CM_03.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-27 09:02:19.066457

Like many moderate-income workers, public school teachers Julia and Scott Whitnall didn’t think they’d become homeowners in their early 30s. Especially in California.
“We never felt homeownership was in our cards. But we did it!” Julia Whitnall said. “We’re extremely happy.”
The couple moved May 16 to a $509,000 two-bedroom house in Ripon, east of San Francisco in the Central Valley region.
It wasn’t easy. Despite a relatively high combined income of $140,000 from their nearby jobs, they had to compromise on size and take on extra work at summer camps to pull it off. Then they had to exercise patience as the sellers struggled to find a new home.
High interest rates and high prices in a still-competitive housing market continue to make it tough for first-time buyers, even those with good but moderate incomes.
SC homebuyers can get up to $10K in state aid for a down payment

On a national level, households making $75,000 to $100,000 — typical of teachers, nurses and skilled trades workers in many states — face a daunting lack of homes they can afford.
That’s according to new research by the National Association of Realtors and Realtor.com based on listings in March of this year compared with 2024. However, the numbers showed an encouraging 20% increase in homes for sale, affordable or not.
Despite more houses for sale, those moderate-income buyers — which the report called “middle- and upper-middle-income buyers” — are much more hard-pressed to find an affordable home than they were in 2019, when almost half the homes on the market were affordable to them.
This year they can afford only 21.2% of homes on the market — a slight improvement compared with 20.8% in 2024, according to the report.
It also found that a few states are improving in affordability for people in the $75,000-to-$100,000 income range.
But many states are not.
The largest affordability gaps are in California, Hawaii, Idaho, Massachusetts and Montana, where such households can afford fewer than 12% of houses on the market. By contrast, they could afford about half the houses for sale in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Ohio and West Virginia.
There’s progress in states that are adding more housing at moderate price points: Arizona, Colorado, Delaware, Florida and Utah, according to the Realtors report.

 Balanced markets

Nationwide, to get home markets back in line with moderate-income families, the United States needs 416,000 more homes for sale at or below $255,000, according to the report.
“In many places, we’re still seeing a huge mismatch between income levels and what’s available to buy for moderate-income families,” said Nadia Evangelou, the National Association of Realtors’ senior economist and director of real estate research.
“We are no longer in crisis mode, but we are still very far from where we need to be. We can’t fix it overnight. It will take years,” Evangelou said.

Heather, who asked not to share her last name for privacy reasons, said she can’t even think of buying a house near her job on Long Island, New York. She makes more than $100,000 as a registered nurse and her family makes $170,000 with her husband’s job in building maintenance. But $4,400 in rent and $2,000 in monthly day care costs for three children have them living paycheck to paycheck.
“We can’t even afford a small car repair, let alone a mortgage in our hometown” of Ronkonkoma in Suffolk County, Heather said. Their jobs exposed her and her husband to risks in the pandemic that her neighbors avoided with remote work, she said. But she now feels like she’s in worse shape financially than she was in 2019 and considers moving away.
“All of our hard work feels like it was for nothing,” Heather said. “It’s disheartening that we can’t afford to live where we grew up, but that’s the reality we are facing.”
Some states can still be a refuge of affordability.
Ashley and Tristan Jonas bought a $252,000 house in northwest Ohio after three years of getting shut out by higher or all-cash offers. Ashley Jonas, 32, trained as a teacher but now works in skilled trades as a project coordinator for a countertop company, and the couple makes about $140,000 with Tristan Jonas’ job as a computer programmer.
“We happened to hit the market at the right time in 2025,” Ashley Jonas said. “We bid on this house just as [President Donald] Trump was announcing tariffs. I think a lot of people were holding their coin purses. We weren’t.”
 Help for teachers

Teachers, who generally make less than nurses or trades workers, are particularly squeezed. Some states, facing teacher shortages in local schools, are working to raise pay. And increasingly, some schools and hospitals are providing housing to lure more teachers and nurses.
Fast-building states get more babies

“We lose so many teachers because they can’t find housing here,” said Autumn Rivera, a 20-year teaching veteran and 2022 Colorado Teacher of the Year.
Despite her experience and credentials, Rivera said she can’t contemplate buying even a townhouse in the rural resort town of Glenwood Springs, where she teaches.
Prices for those townhouses now start in the $700,000 range, more than twice what they were when she last considered buying in 2019.
Rivera feels lucky to have a reasonable rent by sharing a home with its owner, but many teachers in her Roaring Fork Schools need the 117 apartments provided by the district with affordable rent, she said. The district hopes the apartments will allow teachers to save up for a home; it has also built 14 houses for staff with Habitat for Humanity and Holy Cross Energy.
One way to make homebuying more feasible for teachers is to pay them more — a strategy that paid off for New Mexico, one of the few bright spots in a different report on teachers’ inability to afford housing, which was published this month by the National Council on Teacher Quality, a research and advocacy group.
Beginning teachers in Albuquerque saw a 60% increase in pay between 2019 and 2025, which fell just short of a 65% jump in home prices, according to the report. The report credited a state law that raised teacher salaries, including starting pay, by $10,000.
“We’re dealing with the issue of teachers being able to live in the communities where they’re actually working,” said state Rep. Joy Garratt, a Democrat who sponsored a new law, signed in April, that sets higher minimum salaries for teachers effective July 1.
Detroit schools also gave teachers with advanced degrees a pay boost of up to 50% since 2019, about the same increase as home prices, according to the report from the National Council on Teacher Quality. Albuquerque and Detroit are on the report’s list of most affordable places for beginning teachers to live.
But nationally, on average, experienced teachers who started in 2019 are less able to afford a home now than when they began, according to the report.
“Teacher pay has gone up 24% in the last five years, which some might say is solid growth, and yet the increase in house for purchase has gone up 47%,” said Heather Peske, the organization’s president.
“Housing prices are critical to being able to attract and keep great teachers,” Peske said. “People will be leaving the profession trying to find something that pays enough for housing. And bottom line, kids won’t get as good an education.”

(Photo: Clark County Department of Aviation)After more than two decades of delays federal officials are starting an environmental review for Clark County’s long-anticipated second commercial airport.
Local and federal officials have long sought to build a new airport on 6,000 acres in the Ivanpah Valley north of Primm, arguing the Harry Reid International Airport will not be able to keep up with projected demand for air travel without the supplemental airport.
The Federal Aviation Administration and the Bureau of Land Management issued a notice of intent last week to prepare an environmental impact statement, starting the formal review for the proposed Southern Nevada Supplemental Airport (SNSA).
Rosemary Vassiliadis, the director of aviation for Clark County, called the announcement a major milestone for the region.
“This important step brings us closer to addressing the increasing demand for air travel in one of the nation’s fastest growing regions,” Vassiliadis said in a statement last week.
“As a second commercial airport, SNSA will add much-needed capacity, improve service reliability, and ensure Southern Nevada continues to thrive as a global destination for business and tourism,” she continued.
The Harry Reid International Airport will reach its full capacity of 63 million to 65 million passengers annually by 2030, according to the Clark County Department of Aviation estimates
The Clark County Department of Aviation said the Ivanpah airport would provide long-term aviation capacity for the Las Vegas metropolitan area and primarily serve charter, long-haul domestic and international flights.
The supplemental airport was first proposed in 2006 by the Clark County Department of Aviation, but local economic conditions following the Great Recession and other local budgetary constraints stalled the project for decades. In 2010 the Clark County Department of Aviation asked the FAA to suspend any work on the environmental review.
Earlier this year, county officials confirmed that the environmental review process would resume for the future airport, which would include two runways and a terminal building in the Ivanpah Valley.
Congress transferred public land to Clark County for the construction of the airport site in 2000 through the Ivanpah Valley Airport Public Lands Transfer Act.
The new airport site would cover an area of 6,000 acres, 2,000 acres for flood mitigation infrastructure, and an additional 17,000 acres of land that are set aside as a noise compatibility buffer, making the new airport site over 25,000 acres.
State officials have suggested the new airport could lead to further development in Clark County. In 2023, state lawmakers unanimously approved Senate Bill 19 which would allow Clark County to put aside at least 5,000 acres for a new commercial and residential development in the vicinity of the new airport.
Conservation groups have long opposed the development of the airport, saying its development could threaten two endangered species in the area, the desert tortoise and the white-margined penstemon – a small pink bell-shaped flower fixed on long hardy stems with waved oblong leaves.
The rare wildflower only grows in four counties across the Mojave Desert: Clark County, Nye County, San Bernardino County in California, and Mohave County in Arizona.
Patrick Donnelly, the Great Basin director for the Center for Biological Diversity, said the conservation group would follow the environmental review process “to ensure that sensitive biological resources are not unduly harmed by the airport, and that appropriate mitigation measures are implemented.”
“Just because Congress gave the land to Clark County, doesn’t mean the airport is pre-approved. Laws like the Endangered Species Act mandate the strictest of protections,” Donnelly said.
The Federal Aviation Administration and the Bureau of Land Management plan to hold three public scoping meetings this July to gather testimony about the environmental impact of a new airport, starting with a virtual meeting on July 29.
Two in-person meetings will be held in July, the first will be held on July 30 at the East Las Vegas Library, and the second will be on July 31 at Primm Valley Casino Resorts.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/101138-01-FAA_Tower_Strip_View-1744218200-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-27 09:02:19.066457

After 25 years in higher education, including his latest job as president of Park University in Missouri, Smeed moved back to his native Utah, bought a house in St. George and has the intention of making it his family’s forever home.
“I spent a lot of time along the Wasatch Front, but I had spent zero time, with the exception of the last three weeks in the southern part of Utah,” Smeed said in an interview with Utah News Dispatch, “and my wife and I have truly fallen in love with it.”

While some universities have been scrambling to find balanced budget reallocations, Smeed is looking forward to a future Utah Tech catering the highest enrollment it has seen with more full-time faculty, a new classroom building and another residence hall.
This year, the university is expecting its largest fall class ever with over 13,000 students. Five years into his tenure he expects to see more “quality growth,” he said.
“I would envision the university is going to be at 16,000 students in a few years, and then it’s going to go to 20,000 students, perhaps a little after five years,” he said. “And so in order to do that, we actually (need to) have a campus and an infrastructure that can accommodate that growth.”
During the tenure of Smeed’s predecessor, Richard Williams, the school underwent significant changes, including adopting a polytechnic designation with a focus on hands-on experiences, and notably, a name change from Dixie State University approved by the Utah Legislature in 2021. 
But, change isn’t over for the school. With more policy coming from the state Capitol, restricting diversity, equity and inclusion programs, and most recently requiring public universities to cut 10% of their courses’ budgets to reallocate the funds to programs in high demand, Smeed wants to highlight the role of Utah Tech as a polytechnic institution. 
“We have some great investments that are taking place in health sciences as well as investments in engineering and in other programs. And one of the things we’re very proud of is that the priority programs were aligning with the priorities of the state of Utah as well,” Smeed said.
When asked his thoughts on recent legislative action impacting higher education in Utah, he said that as a newcomer to this space in Utah, he sees education actions from the Utah Legislature as “a tremendous breath of fresh air.”

“I’ve seen that we have tremendous partners in the legislature, and tremendous support with the House of Representatives and with the Senate and with the governor,” he said.
And, while DEI initiatives are deeply restricted in public entities in the state, he believes Utah Tech is well positioned to encourage diversity in higher education, mostly because of the open enrollment nature of the university.
“We are proud of the fact that more than 50% of the students are from Washington County and between 70% and 80% are from the state of Utah, but we also have more than 40 other states represented here at Utah Tech, we have nearly 40 countries that are represented as well at Utah Tech,” he said. “So our goal is really to create equal opportunity and equal access to education for all students.”
His thoughts on reinvestment bill
While the first 48 hours of his tenure revolved around loud cheers and the much awaited celebrations of 3,500 students graduating this spring, now Smeed has started to work with the university’s faculty and staff to catch up on what needs to go and what should be boosted after the passage of HB265, the reallocations bill. 
With tight deadline, Utah universities scramble to cut 10% of budget for courses

Some softwares the school contracted weren’t used enough. There were also inefficiencies on the administrative side, Smeed said. The committee tasked with reviewing the school’s reinvestment efforts also targeted programs that had a decline in enrollment.
“We also wanted to make sure that as we propose new investment in future programs that there were not only investments where we saw that there was interest in the program,” Smeed said, “but they would be programs where students would have the greatest potential to persist and to retain and ultimately graduate.”
The idea, he said, is that students graduate prepared to enter the workforce from day one while keeping their loans low. 
But also, one of his goals is to witness students enjoying a good time during their college years, supporting the school’s Trailblazers, and joining other student clubs to create lasting friendships.

(Andi Rice for Alabama Reflector)Local law enforcement agencies across Alabama are entering into agreements with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), a move that is drawing concern from immigrant communities and civil rights advocates.
At least nine such agreements with sheriff’s offices are active in six Alabama counties, with three more pending — two with county sheriff’s departments and one with a local police department. These agreements, known as 287(g) programs, deputize local officers to enforce federal immigration laws.
“(These) agreements basically give police the capability to do ICE’s job, ICE’s work, and the way the community sees it is police are now immigration officers. That’s the way it translates over to the community,” said Celsa Stallworth, a community organizer in Randolph County with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Alabama.

Colbert, Crenshaw, Elmore, Etowah, Franklin and Henry counties have at least one agreement with ICE. The Houston County Sheriff’s Office and Level Plains Police Department in Dale County have pending agreements.
The 287(g) program, rooted in federal law, allows local law enforcement agencies to partner with ICE, granting designated state and local officers the authority to perform certain immigration enforcement functions. These agreements have existed for years but are seeing renewed interest and implementation, partly due to executive orders incentivizing states to cooperate with federal immigration efforts.
There are different models of 287(g) agreements. The “jail enforcement” model primarily allows local authorities to check the immigration status of individuals booked into county jails and place “ICE holds” on those found to be undocumented, typically for 48 hours, allowing ICE to take them into custody. 
The “warrant service model” gives local law enforcement officers legal authority to execute civil immigration warrants for the ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) office. 
The “task force model” trains officers to act as immigration officers in the community, potentially extending enforcement beyond jails to community detentions. ICE describes it as a “force multiplier for law enforcement agencies.”
While a proponent said these partnerships are crucial for public safety and addressing immigration concerns, critics warn of potential civil rights violations, increased fear within immigrant communities, and a strain on community-police relations.
John Summers, chief of the Level Plains Police Department, a community with a population of about 1,800 in Dale County, is awaiting final approval of a “task force” agreement after an ERO official suggested it would be “a good alternative” to addressing immigration concerns on a local level. He said Level Plains has had a steady Latino population over the years, which he claims were mostly in the country without authorization, though it’s not possible to make that determination without the judicial system.
Level Plains has a Hispanic or Latino population of about 10.3%, according to the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey 2023 5-year average estimate. While the foreign-born population in Level Plains is unavailable, Dale County’s foreign-born population is 3.4%, under Alabama’s average of 3.8%.
“(It) gives us a little more give us a little more authority when it comes to dealing with illegals, and it gives us a better relationship with ICE directly,” Summers said.
But “foreign-born” doesn’t necessarily mean they are Latino or are living in the U.S. without authorization, said Allison Hamilton, executive director of the Alabama Coalition for Immigrant Justice. She said that poultry plants in the Enterprise and Dothan area employ migrants on work permits.
“We saw that people were coming into Alabama to work at those locations. In that area, for example, you’re going to have a lot of people who probably have a work permit, who could easily be detained due to outdated records or just a complete lack of knowledge,” Hamilton said.
Hamilton said these agreements, which give law enforcement “the responsibility of acting as immigration enforcement without the proper knowledge,” could have unintended consequences. She said that immigration law is complicated and that officers receiving basic training on immigration duties aren’t equipped to deal with complex immigration cases.
“If you have a very simplistic understanding, but you’re tasked with trying to enforce that (law), a lot of people who shouldn’t be detained are detained, and this often leads to civil rights violations, and can come back to the officers later as incorrectly enforcing the law,” Hamilton said.
Summers said the department will handle each case individually. He believes most immigrants in the community are “trying to do better for themselves,” but they “have to do it the right way,” saying that these agreements will help the department hold more people accountable.
“We treat everybody fair, and we want to help everybody we can help, legal or illegal, but I mean, at some point you’ve got to help yourself, and you’ve got to follow the rules that we have sworn to uphold,” Summers said.
When asked if immigrants, regardless of status, should feel less safe in communities with these agreements, Hamilton said that if government officials, presumably most trained in immigration law and federal enforcement, are currently detaining people with legal status, she expected that local police performing such duties would lead to even more mistakes.
“I think anybody who is an immigrant or who appears to be an immigrant needs to proceed with caution at this point when interacting with any law enforcement,” Hamilton said, adding that these agreements are damaging law enforcement’s ability to build relationships in immigrant communities.
Stallworth said the consequence of these agreements and increased ICE activity has been the fear created within immigrant communities, affecting both undocumented individuals and naturalized citizens with mixed-status families.
As a U.S.-born citizen who “looks Mexican,” she said, “I am fearful”. She fears for her naturalized mother, who speaks “broken English,” and for her husband, who may get caught up trying to “protect someone.” Stallworth said she had a conversation with a Latina woman in Shelby County who said she was concerned about everyday activities like picking up children from school or going grocery shopping.
“What we tell is that, make sure to follow the law when you’re driving. Make sure that your lights are working and things like that, because they have to continue living,” she said.

The progressive think tank released a state-by-state analysis of the tax provisions of the “Big Beautiful Bill Act” passed Thursday by House Republicans. They found that in Nevada, the richest 1% — households making $796,500 or more a year — would see an average tax benefit of $82,590 in 2026. That’s equivalent to 2.4% of their average annual income, which is $3.5 million.
Households just under them — the 4% of households making between $293,500 and $796,500 — would see a tax benefit of $14,150. That’s equivalent to 3.1% of their average annual income.
Meanwhile, Nevada households in the bottom 20% – those making less than $27,700 a year — would see a tax benefit of $130. That represents 0.8% of their average annual income.
The middle 20% of households — those making between $50,800 and $84,400 — would see a benefit of $1,390. That’s equivalent to 2.1% of that group’s average annual income.
Here’s the tax change across all income levels:

Altogether, ITEP estimates that in Nevada more than a quarter of the tax benefit would go to the top 1% of income earners, and more than two-thirds of the tax benefits would be felt by the top 20% of households.
Nationwide, the richest 1% would receive $121 billion in net tax cuts in 2026. The middle 20% — “a group that is 20 times the size of the richest 1%,” ITEP emphasizes — would receive half that much.
ITEP in its report noted that “high-income people in states with less robust tax systems overall do the best.” Nevada is one of 22 states where the richest 1% would receive an average net tax cut of more than $75,000.
The think tank also noted in the analysis that it expects the effects of President Donald Trump’s tariff policies to offset “most of the tax cuts” for the bottom 80% of Americans, and for the bottom 40% “the tariffs impose a cost that is greater than the tax cuts they would receive under this legislation.”
At the national level, for instance, the poorest 20% of households can expect to see their take-home pay increase by 1% as a result of the changes. But that’s more than offset by a roughly 2.4% decrease in spending power due to the effects of the Trump administration’s tariffs.
The law’s provisions are also relatively favorable toward wealthy overseas investors. “Foreign investors who own shares in U.S. companies would benefit more than the poorest fifth of Americans,” ITEP’s authors wrote. “These foreign investors would enjoy $23 billion in tax cuts in 2026 compared to just $4 billion for the bottom 20% of Americans.”
Because Republicans are using a procedural known as “reconciliation,” the bill cannot be filibustered in the Senate. Republicans control 53 Senate seats, meaning they can lose three votes and still pass the bill with a tie-breaking vote from Vice President JD Vance.

This is not how the Alabama Department of Corrections operates. Instead, we have prisons like Ventress in Clayton. Ventress is where inmates can get treatment for drug and alcohol addiction.
It’s also a place, according to the U.S. Department of Justice, where in 2018 a corrections officer beat a handcuffed inmate, yelling in earshot of four nurses, “I am the reaper of death, now say my name!” That same year, another Ventress corrections officer struck a restrained inmate so hard he broke his jaw in two places and left blood on a nearby wall.
There’s also Bullock Correctional Facility near Union Springs, where according to one lawsuit, officials placed a sexual assault victim in the same dorm as his attacker, leading to a second sexual assault.
Travis Sessions, a 28-year-old inmate, drowned in his own blood, according to yet another lawsuit, at Red Eagle Community Work Center north of Montgomery after officers ignored his requests for help. And let’s not forget Steven Davis, beaten to death by corrections officers at Donaldson Correctional Facility in 2019.
Blood Money: Alabama Department of Corrections pays to settle lawsuits alleging excessive force

Corrections chose to negotiate its way through dozens of cases like these instead of risking a court fight, as Beth Shelburne reported last week. The department has settled 94 lawsuits alleging that corrections officers used excessive force against inmates. It’s helped push the department’s legal bills over $57 million.
That’s a lot of money. If you worked at a company that had to settle dozens of lawsuits over the same pattern of behavior, you’d be trained to stop that behavior. Or your company would be out of business.
In ADOC’s case, we’re talking about patterns that have led to credible allegations that corrections officers left inmates with crippling injuries. Or brain damage. Or dead.
What does the state do?
It cuts a check.
The department leans on a state liability fund to pay settlements. Inmates or their survivors get a relative pittance. Private attorneys representing officers accused of wrongdoing get much more. Shelburne reported that lawyers representing officers got $12.9 million from the state between 2020 and 2024. Settlement payments to inmates and survivors amounted to $4.4 million.
State leaders, by and large, are fine with this.
Excessive force, you say? Here’s a check. Neglect? Talk to our attorneys. Physical trauma? PTSD? People coming out of prison worse than when they went in? Not our problem.
Alabama government values nothing more than its power to confine, to punish and, in some cases, to kill. State officials have fought a DOJ lawsuit over violence in men’s prisons for about four years. It is in court over failures to deliver proper medical and mental health care to inmates. Lawmakers smile benignly as the price of a new prison in Elmore soars far above initial estimates.
So Alabama will pay any price to keep that power and use it with little regard for constitutional restraints. Corrections’ budget grew from $544.1 million in 2021 to an expected $826.7 million next year, a 52% growth rate bigger than Medicaid (44%), which paid for the deliveries of most of the babies born in the state in 2022.
But the state will not or cannot correct the savage status quo in our prisons. Corrections officers can face multiple lawsuits alleging excessive force and not only hold onto their jobs, but win promotions.
Alabama has a lot of stubborn problems, like poverty and shrinking health care access. The prison crisis is something else: a deadly humanitarian disaster that our leaders deliberately built and continually tolerate while private individuals and companies profit off the chaos. People die in state prisons, or emerge with major physical and psychological injuries. The state treats each one of those lives as a sunk cost, a string of numbers to go onto a spreadsheet.
Which means we’re beyond reform. You can’t even tear Corrections down to the studs, because those are rotten, too. If we want prisons that maintain public safety, we need a whole new correctional agency. One that keeps order in its facilities. That treats violence as a failing that has to be fixed, not a monthly bill. Above all, we need a prison department built from a foundation of rehabilitation, not retribution.
At the moment, that project is a political impossibility. Alabama politicians think the price of fixing our prisons is far higher than the cost of ignoring it.
But maybe we can stop calling the agency supervising our prisons “Corrections.” It’s publicly subsidized mayhem that gets nothing right.

But two bills that could have affected how libraries operate failed to move in the Legislature’s 2025 session.
One measure, HB 4, would have applied state obscenity laws to public libraries and their employees if there were materials judged to be obscene in the children’s section. The other, SB 6, would have allowed cities and counties to terminate members of the library boards without cause.
The battles over library books began in Alabama in 2023, after a parent using the Autauga-Prattville Library complained about a book in the children’s section that had inclusive pronouns. Similar fights have erupted all over the state. Supporters of restrictions say they are trying to get obscene material out of children’s sections of the library. Critics say those restrictions target books with LGBTQ+ characters and themes and not necessarily obscene books.

“Our devoted and beleaguered librarians will not have to worry about being handcuffed and jailed for refusing to censor books under House Bill 4, the ‘Jail the Librarians bill,’ which never made it out of its House Committee,” said Read Freely Alabama, a group that opposes new library restrictions, in a statement shortly after the 2025 legislative session ended. “Furthermore, the bill which would have politicized our library boards even more (SB 6) once again died before making it to the Senate floor.”
Multiple messages seeking comment were left with Rep. Arnold Mooney, R-Indian Springs, the sponsor of HB 4, and Sen. Chris Elliott, R-Josephine, the sponsor of SB 6.
Amy Minton, a member of the Alabama Public Library Service (APLS) Board and an advocate of additional restrictions on library content, said in an interview that she was “a little surprised that people get so upset about the obscenity or sexually explicit materials.”
“If they don’t have it in the library, why do they get so upset about them being asked to be moved, whether through a law or policy?” she said.
HB 4 would have amended the state’s obscenity laws to make public libraries and librarians criminally liable for making materials that are sexually explicit or harmful to minors available.
The legislation would have allowed residents served by the library to file a notice with the staff that they believe there are sexually explicit or inappropriate materials found in sections of the library dedicated to minors.
Libraries would then have to relocate the materials to the adult section or remove them entirely. They can also notify the public that they have determined the item is in the appropriate section, which any resident can then challenge.
Noncompliance would have subjected librarians to prosecution under Alabama obscenity laws, which can be as severe as a Class B felony, punishable by up to 20 years in prison and a $30,000 fine.
SB 6 would have mandated that library board members be appointed to a four-year term and that members could be removed from the board with a two-thirds of the members of the governing body, either the city or county, agree by vote.
The House Judiciary Committee never considered HB 4. SB 6 got approval from the Senate County and Municipal Government Committee, which Elliott chairs, but did not come to a vote on the Senate floor.
Mooney’s obscenity bill was approved further along in the 2024 session, receiving approval from members of the House and even getting approved in the Senate Children and Youth Health Committee before it stalled in the Senate. Elliott’s legislation was approved in the Senate and the House County and Municipal Government Committee where it remained as the session ended.
Advocates of restrictions have succeeded in convincing the Alabama Public Library Service, the state agency that oversees local library funding, to impose policy changes that favor more restrictions.
In March, the APLS Board suspended funding to the Fairhope Public Library in Baldwin County while also voting to have Pack terminated after Minton made a motion. Supporters of the library raised money to replace the lost funding and defended the library at city council and APLS meetings.
Alabama GOP chair John Wahl, who currently serves as chair of the APLS Board, said at a meeting earlier this month that members are waiting for the Fairhope Public Library to complete its review of the books that parents challenged before resuming funding to the library.
“We know that the fight isn’t over. As we speak, a stacked and extreme Alabama Public Library Service board continues its assault on libraries, stripping funding from those who will not cave to their demands,” Read Freely Alabama said in the statement. “And even today, as this session closes, opposing forces are already crafting legislation for a chosen representative to prefile, and are regrouping to continue their assault on our freedoms and beloved public institutions at the next legislative session.”

(Courtesy of Great Plains Food Bank)Proposed cuts to the federal food assistance program are coming at a time when agencies addressing hunger in North Dakota are already facing lost revenue and increased need.
“There’s a lot of uncertainty right now,” said Darby Njos, spokeswoman for Great Plains Food Bank in Fargo. “We’re still urging lawmakers to support programs that help people get back on their feet while knowing that the needs of people continue to shift.”
The most recent hit to federal food assistance are proposed cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.
Known as SNAP, this is a federally funded program that gives money for groceries to eligible low-income households – mostly older adults, people with disabilities, and families with children. A budget bill passed by the U.S. House of Representatives last week would end federal nutrition benefits for millions and shift some costs to states, according to an analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
The bill still needs to be considered by the U.S. Senate.
More than 3 million people would lose SNAP benefits under GOP bill, nonpartisan report says

Great Plains Food Bank is the only food bank in North Dakota and distributes food to those in need throughout the state and Clay County, Minnesota.
Earlier this year it lost about $1.3 million in funding and food because of federal cuts, Njos said.
Some of those cuts were through a program that allowed the food bank to purchase meat and produce from local farmers. This year Great Plains Food Bank expected three rounds of funding, each around $1 million. The first round came through, the second round of funding was paused and then reinstated. 
The food bank has been informed it won’t receive the third round, Njos said.
“We worked directly with several farmers, and we had to have some tough conversations,” she said. “We don’t have the ability to make those purchases without that funding.”
In addition, the food bank will not receive summer deliveries of food through The Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP). These deliveries equaled about $300,000 in food.
The nonprofit was able to raise about $250,000 in private funds to help offset those losses, but the cuts are still felt.
“Those cuts impact our day-to-day work,” Njos said. “We’re working hard to fill in those gaps.”
States on the hook for billions under U.S. House GOP bill making them help pay for SNAP

In 2024, the food bank served 151,000 people in North Dakota and Clay County. About one-third of those served are children; 16% are seniors, Njos said. 
“These are vulnerable populations that don’t have a lot of options if they’re hungry,” Njos said. “You don’t want them worrying about where to get their next meal.”
About 28% of Great Plains Food Bank’s food sourcing traditionally comes through government programs. While some funding and commodities are still being received, the loss of purchasing power strains resources. 
“We’ve had to adapt quickly,” Njos said. “These cuts are real, and they’re being felt at every level.”
Susie Boelter is executive director of North Country Food Bank, which serves part of Grand Forks County in North Dakota and 21 counties in northwestern and western Minnesota. This food bank has seen what Boelter calls “staggering increases” of use over the past three years.
Cutting federal food assistance would add to that need.
“If there are cuts to SNAP that would have a huge impact on us,” Boelter said. “For every meal we provide (through the food bank), SNAP provides nine.”
North Country Food Bank has seen some shifts in which federal contracts are funded but it hasn’t seen a loss in overall federal revenue. Boelter said it’s still time for additional help – not less.
“Any additional cuts will put a ton of pressure on our emergency food system,” she said. “Food banks are good at getting food into the hands of people who need it, but it’s time to sound the alarm.”
One bright spot in food assistance is that federal funding for summer food programs remains in place, according to Melissa Anderson, assistant director for Child Nutrition and Food Distribution Programs at the state Department of Public Instruction.
Two federal programs – Summer Food Service and the Summer EBT – provide nutrition for North Dakota students who have access to free and reduced-cost meals during the school year.  
This summer 42 schools and nonprofits are offering a free meal or snack at over 130 sites throughout North Dakota.
In addition, the state Department of Public Instruction works with the Department of Health and Human Services to distribute EBT cards worth $120 to eligible students. Households have 120 days to use those dollars to purchase groceries, Anderson said.
The state expects about 44,000 students will be eligible.
These summer programs are successful in getting food to those who need it, and Anderson is optimistic the funding will remain. She also acknowledges that policies and funding streams can change quickly.
“Every day there’s new information,” Anderson said. “We’re trying to stay positive but there are a lot of unknowns.”
Lawmakers earlier this year approved $5 million in grant funding for the Great Plains Food Bank through the state Department of Agriculture to support the construction of a new statewide distribution center. The state’s investment will be matched by private donations raised by the agency.
The food bank is preparing to break ground in 2027.
This investment reflects the region’s commitment to taking care of their neighbors, Njos said. 
“We’ve always thrived in times of crisis,” said Njos. “North Dakotans stand up when their neighbors are in need, and we’ll continue doing whatever it takes to ensure no one goes hungry.”

(Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)State health officials have made progress on conducting annual inspections for assisted living programs, as 55.6% of facilities received an annual inspection in 2024 — up from just 25.7% of facilities receiving an annual inspection in the previous year.
It’s good news, according to senior advocates and providers for assisted living programs. But that means that almost half of those facilities might still be behind on annual inspections used to ensure that seniors are receiving quality care in a safe environment.
“We’re encouraged by the improved number of inspections – going from about one-in-four to about half,” Hank Greenberg, state director for the AARP of Maryland, said in a recent interview. “That’s good, but not good enough.”
He hopes that the increased inspections will lead to greater attention towards assisted living facilities in the state, which he believes have been somewhat overlooked in recent years.
Maryland health officials have been trying to catch up on annual inspections for various programs and facilities that support Maryland’s aging population, such as the state’s nursing homes. Assisted living facilities are senior living options for residents who need additional supports for daily tasks but do not need the same intensive medical care provided in nursing homes.
Health officials cut inspection backlog of nursing homes, advocates demand more

Unlike nursing homes, assisted living facilities do not receive federal oversight meaning that regulations are left up to the state. In Maryland, information on recent inspections for assisted living facilities is not readily available to the public, making it challenging for advocates and families to determine if their aging loved ones are living in a facility that has recently received an annual inspection for safety and health.
“We all rely on these inspections to determine whether or not these facilities are providing a standard of care that is acceptable,” Greenberg said. “As more and more people are in need of facilities … they are looking for safe spaces for loved ones — in some cases, a spouse. In some cases, it’s a parent. They really need to know where they’re sending someone, or themselves — that it’s a safe environment.”
Annual inspections had been trending downward since 2021, according to a state audit released in April. For fiscal 2021, 59% of assisted living facilities received an annual survey. But the next year, that dropped to just 38% of all facilities across the state.
The trend continued for fiscal 2023, when only 444 out of 1,721 facilities received an annual inspection — just 25.7%, the lowest inspection rate in the last five years.
In the health department’s response to state auditors, the agency agreed with the need to improve annual survey rates, noting that its Office of Health Care Quality (OHCQ) was in the process of training more surveyors to keep up with annual inspection requirements.
The department said it anticipates “being in compliance with annual inspections” by November this year.
The agency’s efforts appear to be paying off. OHCQ reported in November that for fiscal 2024, 904 assisted living facilities in Maryland received an annual state inspection. While that’s just over half of the 1,625 facilities in the state — down from 1,721 the year before — it’s a stark improvement from previous years.
Allison Roenigk Ciborowski, president and CEO of LeadingAge Maryland, said that the state surveys are “an important piece of the puzzle” for ensuring that senior residents receive a high quality of care at their assisted living programs.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“The survey agency has been an important partner and plays an important role in ensuring quality and ensuring peace of mind for residents and families,” Ciborowski said.
She added that long-awaited updates to state regulations for assisted living facilities that recently went into effect will further ensure Marylanders receive quality care in those programs.
The new regulations have been 10 years in the making. The wide-ranging adjustments to state rules for assisted living facilities include new staffing requirements, additional training education, updated definitions and more.
Documents from the OHCQ describe the lengthy rule-making process as a “complex undertaking that started in 2015” involving hundreds of stakeholders and four public comment periods in 2016, 2021, 2023 and 2024.
While the regulations do not make major changes to the survey process specifically, Ciborowski said that the new rules make “really good improvements to the assisted living regulations that will further support ensuring that folks have access to high quality care and supports.”
“It’s important that regulations are looked at and revised and modernized as best practices change,” she said.
But Greenberg hopes that more attention is paid to assisted living facilities in general to protect seniors, some of Maryland’s most vulnerable populations.
“What were the result of those inspections? What percentage found violations? Were there follow-ups to ensure compliance? Those are some questions that we still have,” Greenberg said. “It’s imperative to have all of them inspected, unannounced, and done so on a consistent basis to ensure quality of care in those facilities.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024_dec3_mdh_statecenter_edit-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-27 08:02:09.864162

(Photo by Senior Airman Thomas Karol/U.S. Air Force)It takes most Americans an average of $270 and 13 hours to do their taxes. With Direct File, it takes less than 60 minutes to do it yourself and costs nothing. Direct File is the IRS’s new electronic option for taxpayers to file their income tax returns directly with the IRS for free.
This tax season, Direct File’s pilot expanded to 25 states, including Maryland. Our nonprofit organization, the CASH (Creating Assets, Savings and Hope) Campaign of Maryland (CASH), supported the development of the Maryland State Return add-on to IRS Direct File that directly linked taxpayers to a state return upon completion of their federal tax return.
Through targeted outreach and partnerships with local organizations, we helped raise awareness about Direct File and connected thousands of Marylanders with free, accessible tax filing options. This work builds on our long-standing commitment to financial stability and economic empowerment for working families: We promote economic advancement for low- to moderate-income individuals and families and lead a coalition of over 50 free tax preparation sites known as Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) sites across the state.

Like VITA, Direct File gives Marylanders a free, easy, and trustworthy option to meet their tax filing obligations. Unlike VITA, Direct File gives taxpayers an option that doesn’t require securing limited appointments and allows them to get their taxes done from home (or even cellphone!).
This flexibility is especially important for people with nontraditional work schedules, caregiving responsibilities or transportation barriers. By removing these obstacles, Direct File ensures that more people can meet their tax obligations on their own time, without sacrificing work hours or family commitments.
Direct File echoes the goals of VITA while expanding its capacity, giving more low- and moderate-income Americans the opportunity to file their taxes for free rather than paying for and using a third-party tax preparer or software. While VITA is reliant on trained and certified volunteers and nonprofits for capacity, Direct File can be accessed by millions.
The Trump administration and Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) told reporters in April that Direct File would not continue next year, citing “hidden costs,” “taxpayer confusion” and the expense of administering the program.
There are no costs, hidden or otherwise, to use the program. Direct File is completely free to eligible taxpayers. Because the program allows taxpayers to file directly with the IRS and their states, users are never redirected to paid options.
The same cannot be said about Free File compliant software offered by traditional tax software developers like TaxAct and TaxSlayer. Notably, TurboTax by Intuit and H&R Block, two of the largest and most well-known paid tax preparation companies, withdrew from the Free File Alliance in 2021.
Filing your taxes can be confusing, but Direct File is simpler and more user-friendly than third-party tax software. Participants during the first year of the program said it themselves: 90% ranked their overall experience as Excellent or Above Average, 90% who used customer support rated that experience as Excellent or Above Average, and 86% of respondents said that their experience with Direct File increased their trust in the IRS. Plus, Direct File users have access to customer support from real people during the entire process.
Continuing to build Direct File is an investment that will save time and money for Americans far into the future. If Direct File continues, the taxpayer dollars already invested will not go to waste.
Progress has already been made to expand the program. Direct File can grow to serve more states and a wider range of tax situations. Future versions of the program can simplify the process by prefilling information the IRS already has (like the details of a W-2 form). If it is not preemptively shut down, Direct File will continue to be improved based on real feedback from its users.
Paying taxes allows our country to thrive, and Americans should not be burdened with extra costs and time-consuming processes to meet their filing obligations. Protecting the Direct File program is an investment in everyday Americans – making their government work for them.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/7055546-1024x659.jpg,,,2025-05-27 08:02:09.864162

(Photo by Jessica Holdman/SC Daily Gazette)A new state law lets South Carolina cities set their own rules for where and when golf carts can be driven but requires a new rule for passengers: Children under 12 must buckle up.
As initially proposed, the bill authorized any county to pass an ordinance allowing golf carts with headlights and rear lights to be driven at night. The purpose was to expand on permission that a 2016 law gave only to certain barrier islands.
But the Senate took it further — letting municipalities “stipulate the hours, methods, and locations” for daylight golf cart driving too and adding statewide the safety rule for children.
“I unfortunately have had the misfortune of seeing too many kids maimed and killed on golf carts,” said Senate Minority Leader Brad Hutto. “It’s awful.”
The Orangeburg Democrat works as an attorney and has handled such cases as part of his law practice.
“When you see golf carts go by and there are kids sitting on the back of these golf carts that are not in a seat belt, you know good and well if they slam on the brakes those kids going right off the back and maybe right in front of the car that’s following them,” Hutto said during floor debate in the Senate earlier this month.
Sen. Ronnie Cromer agreed, telling his fellow senators he had seatbelts installed in his wife’s custom-built golf cart.
“I have seen kids at the beach that are riding on the back of those carts. How the parents were holding them in, I don’t know,” the Prosperity Republican said. “So I think that’s a pretty good idea to force people to put seat belts on.”
The seat belt rule came up as part of a larger debate about how South Carolina handles the recreational carts, which can be driven during daylight hours with a permit on any public road where the speed limit is 35 mph or less.
Drivers must be at least 16 years old and have a driver’s license.
State law previously limited their usage to within 4 miles from the address where they’re registered or within 4 miles of a gated community. However, local governments could reduce the allowed routes to 2 miles.
The new law leaves that distance entirely up to local governments. The 4-mile rule stays intact for anywhere without its own ordinance.
“In the past, we’ve created exceptions … and it became sort of this patchwork quilt of golf cart regulations,” said Sen. Greg Hembree.
Rather than continuing down that path, the Little River Republican instead urged legislators to overhaul the law, setting minimum standards but also giving all local governments the ability to enact tougher restrictions that go beyond what’s in state law.
“Every community is a little different,” he said. “Every community has its own unique dangers or areas that are safer. And it’s more appropriate for that local government to make those decisions.”
For example, towns might have certain areas where they don’t want to allow golf carts to be used at all, Hembree said.
“And quite frankly, under this bill, a local government could regulate them out of existence in a community,” he said.
The legislation passed both the House and Senate with almost no opposition. Gov. Henry McMaster signed it into law last Thursday. It took effect immediately.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_3663-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-27 08:02:09.864162

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)Donald Trump’s victory in November had led the Democratic Party nationally to engage in some serious soul searching. In Florida, it was the second successive electoral blowout, and the conversations about how to cope with that reality are underway.
Take the discussion held last Thursday night, sponsored by the Hillsborough County Democratic LGBTQ+ Caucus in Tampa.
“Democrats are the best at losing, losing, losing,” said Mike Drapak of The Hillsborough Society, a political commitee formed in the aftermath of party infighting with the Hillsborough County Democratic Executive Committee. “And that’s really where we need to start, and we need to start being self-reflective.”
Party members need to stop “pointing fingers” and instead look at themselves in the mirror start “understanding exactly what it is we’re doing that’s making people dislike us,” Drapak said.
The descent of the party has been well documented at this point. After losing all statewide races by double-digit deficits in 2022 and 2024, the party saw two members of their already super-minority in the state House of Representatives flip to the GOP last December, followed up last month with their then state Senate leader, South Florida’s Jason Pizzo, dramatically announcing on the floor that he was leaving the party because it was “dead.”
Gov. Ron DeSantis couldn’t resist pouncing on the party’s problems last week,  declaring  that Pizzo’s announcement that he would run for governor as a political independent was necessary “because people know if you have a ‘D’ next to your name in this state, you are dead meat. Because this party is a disaster.”
Much of the discussion last week among the Tampa Democrats last week centered on messaging. Nick Clemente, who lost a state House race to Republican Traci Koster in November, said the Florida Democratic brand is “unequivocally broken.”
“How do we talk about regular folks who might listen to podcasts about UFC, who might listen to podcasts about NASCAR or speed metal and not about politics?” he asked the audience of around 50 people. “How do we connect with them on our values and the things that we have in common that maybe we can help fix the brand, so people aren’t ashamed to be Democrats?”
Logan Mueller, president of the University of Tampa Democrats, said a major problem in his opinion is that the Democrats were still campaigning “like it’s 1996.”
“They’ve won the information battle right now,” he said of the GOP. 
“With the internet and podcasts and videos, we do not have any boots on the ground. All the largest podcasts and these things that people are connected to are all very conservative. There is no means that we can push a message, and on top of that, we don’t have a unified message that we can share with everybody. We don’t have a positive economic message that everybody wants. The reason Trump was also partially successful was that he sold optimism. He sold making America great again.”
‘Too complicated’
Sabrina Bousbar agreed with Mueller.
The 28-year-old Pinellas native campaigned for Joe Biden in 2020 and later served as a senior adviser in his U.S. Department of Health & Human Services’ Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response. She ran for Congress last summer, finishing second behind fellow Democrat Whitney Fox in Florida’s 13th District. (Fox went on to lose to GOP incumbent Anna Paulina Luna).
“We’re a little too complicated,” she said. “We try to have messaging for every single silo, but we don’t have a cohesive message with everyone.”
Mueller said he encounters a lot of his fellow students at UT who prefer registering as non-party-affiliated rather than a Democrat.
“They don’t want to associate with a party that has kind of lost the messaging war,” Mueller added. “[The party] has a lot of negative strings attached to it. And by registering as an independent, it kind of avoids the mess that has kind of been created over a long period of time. And the way forward is actually running an economic positive message, because young people do care about the economy, just as much as anyone else does.”
The fourth member of the panel was Tamika Lyles, an Osceola County Democrat seeking the party’s’s nomination for U.S. Senate next year. She complained that Democratic candidates wait too long to connect with the electorate.
“They don’t see us until it’s primary time or general election time, when we’re knocking on a door and we’re trying to give them that message. They’re not hearing it,” she said.”Because the first thing they say is, ‘Where have you been the whole year? What have you been doing the whole year?’ What was the messaging like the whole year when all of this was going on? So we need someone who is continuously speaking that language.”
A common theme among Democrats in the aftermath of the 2024 election nationally and in Florida is “meeting voters where they are.”
As someone who has worked with organized labor around the country, Drapek said,  he’s found “a significant amount” of misogyny, homophobia, and racism in the American heartland.
“We need to understand that,” he said. “And we need to learn on how we can message in a way that doesn’t actually bring the most radical people of that end to the table, but some  of the people who want some of the same things that we do.”
While there was plenty of talk about messaging, or the lack thereof, there wasn’t as much dialogue about policy and how to adjust to an electorate that has shifted to the right over the past five years.
Latino vote
When it comes to the Latino vote, a key demographic in Florida that supported Trump by double-digits over Kamala Harris last fall, a member of the Pinellas Hispanic Caucus suggested a possible opening would be to reengage specifically with Venezuelans who are upset about a U.S. Supreme Court decision last week that immediately strips Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, from hundreds of thousands of themselves.
In a survey of 408 Venezuelan residents in Florida conducted last month by Florida International University’s Latino Public Opinion Forum, nearly half of those who reported voting for Donald Trump in 2024 now say they either regret their decision or have mixed feelings about it. More than 70% say they oppose Trump’s decision to end humanitarian parole for Venezuelans.
“We should use this as ammunition,” said Bousbar, who is of Moroccan and Columbian descent. The GOP has targeted Latinos in Florida since Barack Obama left the political scene more than a decade ago.
“Latinos started going more Republican each election cycle. And so now, though, that we’re seeing the actual impact of this anti-immigration — illegally sending people back to their countries, or also putting them in jails without notification or telling their families or any form of legal structured procedure that they should have in the state and in the U.S. — we have to take that and communicate to them,” she said.
“We should be putting Spanish radio ads, Spanish TV messaging around the laws that Donald Trump has done around the Latino communities, specifically Venezuelans and Cubans and within the state of Florida because maybe we can get that pendulum to come back our way.”

(Ellen Schmidt/Minnesota Reformer)Read more Stateline coverage of housing policy across the country.
Like many moderate-income workers, public school teachers Julia and Scott Whitnall didn’t think they’d become homeowners in their early 30s. Especially in California.
“We never felt homeownership was in our cards. But we did it!” Julia Whitnall said. “We’re extremely happy.”
The couple moved May 16 to a $509,000 two-bedroom house in Ripon, east of San Francisco in the Central Valley region.
It wasn’t easy. Despite a relatively high combined income of $140,000 from their nearby jobs, they had to compromise on size and take on extra work at summer camps to pull it off. Then they had to exercise patience as the sellers struggled to find a new home.
High interest rates and high prices in a still-competitive housing market continue to make it tough for first-time buyers, even those with good but moderate incomes.
The number of new apartments is at a 50-year high, but states expect a slowdown

On a national level, households making $75,000 to $100,000 — typical of teachers, nurses and skilled trades workers in many states — face a daunting lack of homes they can afford. That’s according to new research by the National Association of Realtors and Realtor.com based on listings in March of this year compared with 2024. However, the numbers showed an encouraging 20% increase in homes for sale, affordable or not.
Despite more houses for sale, those moderate-income buyers — which the report called “middle- and upper-middle-income buyers” — are much more hard-pressed to find an affordable home than they were in 2019, when almost half the homes on the market were affordable to them. This year they can afford only 21.2% of homes on the market — a slight improvement compared with 20.8% in 2024, according to the report.
It also found that a few states are improving in affordability for people in the $75,000-to-$100,000 income range. But many states are not.
The largest affordability gaps are in California, Hawaii, Idaho, Massachusetts and Montana, where such households can afford fewer than 12% of houses on the market. By contrast, they could afford about half the houses for sale in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Ohio and West Virginia.
There’s progress in states that are adding more housing at moderate price points: Arizona, Colorado, Delaware, Florida and Utah, according to the Realtors report.



Balanced markets
Nationwide, to get home markets back in line with moderate-income families, the United States needs 416,000 more homes for sale at or below $255,000, according to the report.
“In many places, we’re still seeing a huge mismatch between income levels and what’s available to buy for moderate-income families,” said Nadia Evangelou, the National Association of Realtors’ senior economist and director of real estate research.
“We are no longer in crisis mode, but we are still very far from where we need to be. We can’t fix it overnight. It will take years,” Evangelou said.

Heather, who asked not to share her last name for privacy reasons, said she can’t even think of buying a house near her job on Long Island, New York. She makes more than $100,000 as a registered nurse and her family makes $170,000 with her husband’s job in building maintenance. But $4,400 in rent and $2,000 in monthly day care costs for three children have them living paycheck to paycheck.
“We can’t even afford a small car repair, let alone a mortgage in our hometown” of Ronkonkoma in Suffolk County, Heather said. Their jobs exposed her and her husband to risks in the pandemic that her neighbors avoided with remote work, she said. But she now feels like she’s in worse shape financially than she was in 2019 and considers moving away.
“All of our hard work feels like it was for nothing,” Heather said. “It’s disheartening that we can’t afford to live where we grew up, but that’s the reality we are facing.”
Some states can still be a refuge of affordability.
Ashley and Tristan Jonas bought a $252,000 house in northwest Ohio after three years of getting shut out by higher or all-cash offers. Ashley Jonas, 32, trained as a teacher but now works in skilled trades as a project coordinator for a countertop company, and the couple makes about $140,000 with Tristan Jonas’ job as a computer programmer.
“We happened to hit the market at the right time in 2025,” Ashley Jonas said. “We bid on this house just as [President Donald] Trump was announcing tariffs. I think a lot of people were holding their coin purses. We weren’t.”
Help for teachers
Teachers, who generally make less than nurses or trades workers, are particularly squeezed. Some states, facing teacher shortages in local schools, are working to raise pay. And increasingly, some schools and hospitals are providing housing to lure more teachers and nurses.
“We lose so many teachers because they can’t find housing here,” said Autumn Rivera, a 20-year teaching veteran and 2022 Colorado Teacher of the Year. Despite her experience and credentials, Rivera said she can’t contemplate buying even a townhouse in the rural resort town of Glenwood Springs, where she teaches.

Prices for those townhouses now start in the $700,000 range, more than twice what they were when she last considered buying in 2019. Rivera feels lucky to have a reasonable rent by sharing a home with its owner, but many teachers in her Roaring Fork Schools need the 117 apartments provided by the district with affordable rent, she said. The district hopes the apartments will allow teachers to save up for a home; it has also built 14 houses for staff with Habitat for Humanity and Holy Cross Energy.
One way to make homebuying more feasible for teachers is to pay them more — a strategy that paid off for New Mexico, one of the few bright spots in a different report on teachers’ inability to afford housing, which was published this month by the National Council on Teacher Quality, a research and advocacy group.
Beginning teachers in Albuquerque saw a 60% increase in pay between 2019 and 2025, which fell just short of a 65% jump in home prices, according to the report. The report credited a state law that raised teacher salaries, including starting pay, by $10,000.
“We’re dealing with the issue of teachers being able to live in the communities where they’re actually working,” said state Rep. Joy Garratt, a Democrat who sponsored a new law, signed in April, that sets higher minimum salaries for teachers effective July 1.
Detroit schools also gave teachers with advanced degrees a pay boost of up to 50% since 2019, about the same increase as home prices, according to the report from the National Council on Teacher Quality. Albuquerque and Detroit are on the report’s list of most affordable places for beginning teachers to live.
But nationally, on average, experienced teachers who started in 2019 are less able to afford a home now than when they began, according to the report.
“Teacher pay has gone up 24% in the last five years, which some might say is solid growth, and yet the increase in house for purchase has gone up 47%,” said Heather Peske, the organization’s president.
“Housing prices are critical to being able to attract and keep great teachers,” Peske said. “People will be leaving the profession trying to find something that pays enough for housing. And bottom line, kids won’t get as good an education.”

Gov. Bob Ferguson last week signed the state’s new “Right to Repair” policy into law. The goal of House Bill 1483 is to allow consumers to fix their devices instead of throwing them away and buying new ones.
It was a yearslong effort to get the law approved.
“This is a win for every person in Washington state,” said the bill’s prime sponsor, Rep. Mia Gregerson, D-SeaTac. “We all know that we want to keep our devices longer. We want to be able to connect with our loved ones.”
In 2021, the Federal Trade Commission reported that consumers with broken electronics don’t have much choice but to replace them because repairs require specialized tools, unique parts and inaccessible proprietary software. And those restrictions, the FTC found, disproportionately burden communities of color and low-income communities.
The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated these issues as access to technology quickly became increasingly vital.
Apple has since made moves to improve the repairability of its products. 
Some companies engage in a practice called “parts pairing” that can make replacing parts of a device impossible. Washington’s new law would largely outlaw this tactic.
Starting Jan. 1, 2026, the law will require manufacturers to make tools, parts and documentation needed for diagnostics and maintenance available to independent repair businesses. The requirement applies to digital electronics, like computers, cellphones and appliances, that were first sold in Washington after July 1, 2021. 
Manufacturers won’t be able to use parts that inhibit repairs. 
The state attorney general’s office could enforce violations of the new law under the Consumer Protection Act.
Critics argued the bill could harm businesses’ reputations if repairs aren’t completed correctly, and potentially leave users’ personal information unsecured. But some tech giants backed the legislation. 
Google, for example, thanked the governor for signing it.
“This is a significant win for consumers, and will provide them more affordable ways to repair their devices while reducing waste,” a spokesperson said in an email.
Microsoft said its “Surface PCs are among the most repairable in their class — and we view this law as a meaningful step toward reducing waste, empowering consumers, and advancing a more circular economy.”
State lawmakers across the country have introduced similar legislation in recent years. Five states now have laws on the books: California, Colorado, Minnesota, New York and Oregon. Massachusetts and Maine have such laws focused on car repairs.
Southwest Washington U.S. Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, a Democrat, has led the charge in Congress for national Right to Repair laws focused on cars, electronics and military equipment. Before joining Congress, Gluesenkamp Perez co-owned an auto repair shop.
Late last month, the U.S. Army, at the direction of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, announced it would seek “Right to Repair” provisions in all of its contracts. 
Ferguson also signed a similar repair bill focused on wheelchairs and mobility scooters. Both measures had strong bipartisan support.

This issue is critical to individuals and employers alike, and the IMA is encouraged that Indiana has seen a lot of improvement on this topic in recent legislative sessions. 
Senate Enrolled Act 140, however, takes a step in the wrong direction. By mandating  pharmacy dispensing fees, SEA 140 will ultimately burden employers and individuals with higher prescription drug expenses across the board. 
At the heart of our concern is the provision within SEA 140 that mandates insurers, pharmacy benefit managers, or other administrators of pharmacy benefits to reimburse pharmacies at a rate that includes “a fair and reasonable dispensing fee.” This mandated fee will raise prescription drug costs on consumers.  
Our estimates indicate that this bill will lead to at least $100 million in new health care  spending. 
It’s crucial to understand that these increased costs won’t simply be absorbed by insurers or employers. Instead, they will inevitably be passed down to consumers, further straining already tight family budgets. 
As businesses grapple with higher health care expenses, they may be forced to make difficult decisions, such as reducing benefits, raising employee deductibles, or increasing employee copays for prescription drugs. This ultimately translates to less money in the pockets of Hoosier families, making it harder to afford essential goods and services. 
Indiana employers, who provide health insurance benefits to their employees, will also bear a substantial burden. The increased cost of providing these benefits may very well negate any progress made this year in lowering health care costs. This is a serious concern for Indiana manufacturers, who already face a competitive disadvantage compared to companies in states with lower health care costs. The new spending mandated by SEA 140 will only exacerbate this problem. 
We are also troubled by the fact that SEA 140 exempts Medicaid and the state employee health plan. This exemption means that commercial payers, employers and individuals who purchase private health insurance will disproportionately shoulder the burden of  these increased costs, while the state itself avoids the financial impact.  
Simply put, legislators recognized the cost of this new fee and protected the budget they were writing but still raised the cost of prescription drugs on the private sector. 
Pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) reform is necessary, and SEA 140 does contain some positive provisions. However, these positive aspects are overshadowed by the misguided and unfair mandate on health care payers. 
The IMA is committed to addressing the rising cost of health care in Indiana because we recognize the burden it places on Hoosier employers, employees, and families. Moving forward, we encourage the legislature to pursue a more equitable approach to addressing  pharmacy reimbursement issues.

(Vicki Smith/Getty Images)Property tax tweaks and a new online portal were among this year’s legislative wins for Hoosier farmers. But a high-priority proposal to help retiring farmers transition land to a new generation of growers failed to cross the finish line in the final days of the session.
Rural-focused portions of Gov. Mike Braun’s first agenda pledged to “cut red tape,” strengthen the agricultural economy and protect Indiana farmland from encroaching development.
The Republican governor had two early successes: property tax relief and a new online farmer portal.
 Some legislative wins
Baked into Senate Enrolled Act 1, a hotly-debated property tax measure, were changes to how farmland is assessed for property taxes — increasing the capitalization rate in the farmland formula from 8% to 9%, and adding a new assessed value deduction.
Braun maintained those changes will bring at least some relief for farmers. Agricultural lobbying groups agreed, in part, but said more works need to be done on property taxes, specifically.

“While this will provide relief to Hoosier farmers on their real property taxes the next couple of years, taxes on other agricultural infrastructure like farm buildings and permanent structures are expected to increase due to shifts within the tax base,” said Andy Tauer, Indiana Farm Bureau’s executive director of public policy. “Our members have seen property tax bills go up 60% over the past three years, while net farm incomes have gone down. So, we need to return to the Statehouse in the coming years to craft a more comprehensive and sustainable solution for farmers.”
Another win came in House Enrolled Act 1149, the first bill signed into law by Braun.
The measure, authored by Rep. Kendell Culp, R-Rensselaer, creates an online “one-stop-shop” portal for farmers to access funding opportunities, regulatory information and state agency contacts.
“Hoosier farmers feed America and power our economy, and this bill makes their important job a little bit easier,” the governor told reporters at a Statehouse bill signing ceremony.
Braun’s plan additionally called for the creation of a farmland preservation task force, as well as upgrades in rural communities, including roads, broadband and water systems.
Members of Indiana Farm Bureau’s water task force in 2024 identified a “gap” in protections for agriculture and significant groundwater well users who utilize irrigation or need water for livestock, Tauer said. Under earlier state law, those users were responsible for proving any loss of water and were liable in court.
Farm bureau leadership said the lobbying group worked with Republican Sen. Sue Glick, of LaGrange, to craft Senate Enrolled Act 28, which establishes a reporting and investigation process managed by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources to fix those issues and ensure that agriculture is protected in cases when usable water is unavailable. Braun signed the legislation in mid-April.
“Although we were successful in getting our water policy signed, we did not get the property tax relief that Hoosier farmers really need,” said Indiana Farm Bureau President Randy Kron. “While we are appreciative of the change in the farmland formula, it’s incredibly important that we advocate for more tax relief for our members in the future and we vow to do just that.
Other agricultural sector bills that passed and were supported by Indiana Farm Bureau and other lobbying groups included:

Senate Enrolled Act 461: Clarifies the responsibilities of the Indiana Grain Buyers and Warehouse Licensing Agency, ensuring better compliance and support for struggling licensees.
House Enrolled Act 1012: Requires law enforcement to inform landowners of any damage to their property resulting from motor vehicle accidents.
House Enrolled Act 1461: Provides additional funding and tax options for local government infrastructure projects, benefiting rural communities.

Retired farmer credit fails amid budget shortfalls
Axed from the final draft of the state’s next two-year budget, however, was a tax credit to support land transitions.
The proposed “retiring farmers tax credit,” originally introduced by Culp, would have offered up to $67,000 in tax credits to landowners who sell or lease farmland or agricultural equipment to beginning farmers, helping ease barriers to land access and encouraging transitions to a younger generation of farmers.
Indiana Gov. Mike Braun signs first bill into law, creating new online portal for farmers

Claire Shipp, Midwest policy manager for the American Farmland Trust, said the policy was based on successful models in Minnesota, Iowa and other states.
With more than 34% of Hoosier farmers now over the age of 65, Indiana is facing “a major shift in farmland ownership,” Shipp said.
Many retiring farmers want to sell or lease to a beginning farmer but can’t afford to turn down higher offers from developers or institutional buyers, she added. The tax credit would have provided an incentive “to preserve Indiana’s agricultural legacy, support rural economies, and ensure farmland stays in productive use for future generations.”
Although the tax credit was included in Braun’s proposed budget in February, it was removed by GOP budget writers in the House.
A Senate version of the state budget later added a “beginning farmer tax credit,” modeled after a similar program in Ohio, but was ultimately dropped in final budget negotiations.
Caitlin Smith, Indiana Farm Bureau’s director of policy engagement, said that while her group supported the tax credit, budget pressures ultimately derailed the proposal.
She pointed to the state’s April fiscal forecast, which revealed $2 billion less in revenue that expected, prompting lawmakers to trim provisions late in the session.










Keeping farmland in the hands of farmers is not just a private benefit — it is a public good.


– Claire Shipp, Midwest policy manager for the American Farmland Trust


“Indiana Farm Bureau’s two main policy priorities this year were to provide tax relief and water protections,” Smith said. “While we supported the governor’s agenda initiative, as well as Rep. Culp’s bill as filed, ultimately those didn’t make it across the finish line due to budget constraints. After the April forecast was released, legislative leadership made tough decisions to close the budget gap and that was one of the items that fell off.”
Smith noted that the goal of the credit was to help encourage and foster young farmers buying land to start their businesses.
“We know land prices are skyrocketing while the farm economy is on a downward turn, so this credit would be a tool in the toolbox to foster the next generation taking over farms,” she said. “We’re supportive of those initiatives, but we were really focused on asking and advocating for tax relief this year.”
Shipp said the American Farmland Trust plans to advocate for similar legislation again and is working with Culp and other lawmakers to revisit the proposal in 2026.
“Keeping farmland in the hands of farmers is not just a private benefit — it is a public good,” she continued. “When young farmers have access to land, they contribute to local economies, bolster rural communities, and continue the agricultural heritage that sustains Indiana.”

Voting activist Stacey Abrams will be among the headliners at “Medgar Evers at 100: A Legacy of Justice, a Future of Change” at the Jackson Convention Center on June 27-29.
The event, sponsored by the Medgar & Myrlie Evers Institute and Mississippi Votes Action Fund, will focus on his lifelong fight for democracy, justice and youth leadership as a part of the 2nd Annual Democracy in Action.
“My father, Medgar Evers, dedicated his life to the fight for justice, believing that everyday people build true democracy,” said Reena Evers-Everette, executive director of the Medgar & Myrlie Evers Institute. “In the face of adverse political winds, much like those my father confronted, we will use his 100th birthday as a clarion call to the next generation to be voices of courage and justice and continue his mission for justice and equality for all.”
Other speakers include: former MSNBC host Joy-Ann Reid, who wrote a bestseller on Medgar and Myrlie Evers; Eddie S. Glaude Jr., author of the bestselling book, “Begin Again: James Baldwin’s America and Its Urgent Lessons for Our Own”; Nikole Hannah-Jones, Howard University’s Knight Chair in Race and Journalism who won the Pulitzer Prize for “The 1619 Project”; and W. Ralph Eubanks, an award-winning writer and professor of Southern Studies at the University of Mississippi.
“As we reflect on the legacy of Medgar Evers, we are reminded that democracy is not a spectator sport—it demands action, commitment, and courage,” said Arekia Bennett Scott, executive director of Mississippi Votes Action Fund. “This convening is an opportunity to equip the next generation with the tools to lead, organize, and continue the fight for justice in Mississippi and beyond.”
Panels will vary from conversations about ending mass incarceration to the power and dangers of AI. The entire schedule can be seen here.
Evers-Everette said June 29 will be Medgar Evers’ Sunday, an interfaith service that reflects on the life and legacy of the NAACP leader, who was assassinated in Jackson on June 12, 1963. His killer was finally convicted in 1994, thanks to the persistence of his widow, Myrlie Evers.
“One hundred years after Medgar Evers entered this world, the threats he faced—hatred, violence, and suppression—still haunt communities across this country. But Medgar showed us what to do. He helped build a movement from the ground up—one that challenged power, demanded equality, and changed history,” said veteran Democratic strategist Chris Fleming. “Now it’s up to us to continue the work by honoring the blueprint he gave us—applying it with renewed strength, clear purpose, and today’s tools to galvanize the next generation to carry the fight for justice forward.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/23115733/AP22168730223972.jpg,,,2025-05-27 08:02:09.864162

Brad Pollitt, a Sedalia Republican, presents a bill to the House Education Committee to require the reporting of grade-level equivalence data on statewide assessments (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).Missouri parents may soon have a better understanding of whether their child is performing at or above grade level on the state’s standardized test under a sweeping education bill awaiting the governor’s signature. 
The legislation contains a provision that would require the state’s education department to add a fifth category to Missouri Assessment Program results, reporting “grade level” in addition to the current levels of “below basic,” “basic,” “proficient” and “advanced.” The new provision would include students in grades 3 to 8.

State Rep. Brad Pollitt, a Sedalia Republican and former school superintendent, introduced the bill to make student performance more transparent to parents and lawmakers.
As an educator, he learned that students at grade level score at the upper end of “basic,” but many people incorrectly assume “proficient” means performing at grade level, he told The Independent.
“In order to have accurate conversations about where our students are at, we need to know what grade level is,” he said.
The Missouri Assessment Program, often referred to as the MAP test, began in the 1990s with five scoring thresholds. But in response to the federal No Child Left Behind Act, state lawmakers required the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education to align MAP with federal performance standards.
In December 2005, educators met to determine the new standards in line with the National Assessment of Educational Progress, or NAEP. They set thresholds based on the percentage of students scoring proficient on the NAEP so that the proportion of students deemed proficient on the state test would be close to the amount reported by the national test.
The National Center for Educational Statistics and the NAEP’s governing board have repeatedly clarified that proficiency reflects “solid academic performance” and “does not signify being on grade level.”
But policymakers, parents and other stakeholders speak about proficiency and grade level interchangeably. And candidates for public office, misinterpreting what proficient means, have used MAP data to push anti-public-education policies.
During former state Sen. Bill Eigel’s run for governor last year, he told ABC17 that “less than a third of our children are able to do reading, writing, arithmetic at grade level.” At the time, 33% of Missouri fourth graders scored proficient or advanced in reading on the NAEP, and math had higher performance levels.
Despite the test’s administrators explaining that this is not a measure of grade level performance, politicians and media reports still repeat the misrepresentation.
“Part of my frustration has been that people criticize public education pretty hard and say we’re failing our kids because 35% of our students in third grade or fifth grade are proficient or advanced in reading,” Pollitt said. “We may have 35% that are above grade level, but maybe 60% of our kids are at grade level. And I think that changes the conversation.”
In a House committee hearing in January, lobbyists for public-education groups spoke in favor of the bill.
Brandt Shields, director of governmental relations for the Missouri School Boards’ Association, said a fifth category would be more “informative” for stakeholders.
“Having only four categories is almost a crude way of trying to differentiate how those scores are interpreted,” he said.
No one spoke in opposition, but the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education’s lobbyist warned that the change would require work groups to set the new standards, which is estimated to cost just over $1 million.
The language passed by the legislature exempts the department from having to employ work groups, but Pollitt said it is up to administrators to decide.

The U.S. has had more reported tornadoes than normal — over 960 as of May 22, according to the National Weather Service’s preliminary count.
That’s well above the national average of around 660 tornadoes reported by that point over the past 15 years, and it’s similar to 2024 — the second-most active year over that same period.
I’m an atmospheric scientist who studies natural hazards. What stands out about 2025 so far isn’t just the number of tornadoes, but how Tornado Alley has encompassed just about everything east of the Rockies, and how tornado season is becoming all year.
 Why has 2025 been so active?

The high tornado count in 2025 has a lot to do with the weather in March, which broke records with 299 reported tornadoes — far exceeding the average of 80 for that month over the past three decades.
March’s numbers were driven by two large tornado outbreaks: about 115 tornadoes swept across more than a dozen states March 14-16, stretching from Arkansas to Pennsylvania; and 145 tornadoes hit March 31 to April 1, primarily in a swath from Arkansas to Iowa and eastward. The 2025 numbers are preliminary pending final analyses.
While meteorologists don’t know for sure why March was so active, there were a couple of ingredients that favor tornadoes:

First, in March the climate was in a weak La Niña pattern, which is associated with a wavier and stormier jet stream and, often, with more U.S. tornadoes.
Second, the waters of the Gulf were much warmer than normal, which feeds moister air inland to fuel severe thunderstorms.

By April and May, however, those ingredients had faded. The weak La Niña ended and the Gulf waters were closer to normal.
April and May also produced tornado outbreaks, but the preliminary count over most of this period, since the March 31-April 1 outbreak, has actually been close to the average, though things could still change.
What has stood out in April and May is persistence: The jet stream has remained wavy, bringing with it the normal ebb and flow of stormy low-pressure weather systems mixed with sunny high-pressure systems. In May alone, tornadoes were reported in Colorado, Minnesota, Delaware, Florida and just about every state in between.
Years with fewer tornadoes often have calm periods of a couple of weeks or longer when a sunny high-pressure system is parked over the central U.S. However, the U.S. didn’t really get one of those calm periods in spring 2025.
 Tornado Alley shifts eastward

The locations of these storms have also been notable: The 2025 tornadoes through May have been widespread but clustered near the lower and central Mississippi Valley, stretching from Illinois to Mississippi.
That’s well to the east of traditional Tornado Alley, typically seen as stretching from Texas through Nebraska, and farther east than normal. April through May is still peak season for the Mississippi Valley, though it is usually on the eastern edge of activity rather than at the epicenter. The normal seasonal cycle of tornadoes moves inland from near the Gulf Coast in winter to the upper Midwest and Great Plains by summer.
Over the past few decades, the U.S. has seen a broad shift in tornadoes in three ways: to the east, earlier in the year and clustered into larger outbreaks.
Winter tornadoes have become more frequent over the eastern U.S., from the southeast, dubbed Dixie Alley for its tornado activity in recent years, to the Midwest, particularly Kentucky, Illinois and Indiana.
Meanwhile, there has been a steady and stark decline in tornadoes in the “traditional” tornado season and region: spring and summer in general, especially across the Great Plains.
It may come as a surprise that the U.S. has actually seen a decrease in overall U.S. tornado activity over the past several decades, especially for intense tornadoes categorized as EF2 and above. There have been fewer days with a tornado. However, those tornado days have been producing more tornadoes. These trends may have stabilized over the past decade.
 Deadlier tornadoes

This eastward shift is likely making tornadoes deadlier.
Tornadoes in the Southeastern U.S. are more likely to strike overnight, when people are asleep and cannot quickly protect themselves, which makes these events dramatically more dangerous. The tornado that hit London, Kentucky, struck after 11 p.m. Many of the victims were over age 65.
The shift toward more winter tornadoes has also left people more vulnerable. Since they may not expect tornadoes at that time of year, they are likely to be less prepared. Tornado detection and forecasting is rapidly improving and has saved thousands of lives over the past 50-plus years, but forecasts can save lives only if people are able to receive them.

This shift in tornadoes to the east and earlier in the year is very similar to how scientists expect severe thunderstorms to change as the world warms. However, researchers don’t know whether the overall downward trend in tornadoes is driven by warming or will continue into the future. Field campaigns studying how tornadoes form may help us better answer this question
 Remember that it only takes one

For safety, it’s time to stop focusing on spring as tornado season and the Great Plains as Tornado Alley.
Tornado Alley is really all of the U.S. east of the Rockies and west of the Appalachians for most of the year. The farther south you live, the longer your tornado season lasts.
Forecasters say it every year for hurricanes, and we badly need to start saying it for tornadoes too: It only takes one to make it a bad season for you or your community. Just ask the residents of London, Kentucky; St. Louis; Plevna and Grinnell, Kansas; and McNairy County, Tennessee.
Listen to your local meteorologists so you will know when your region is facing a tornado risk. And if you hear sirens or are under a tornado warning, immediately go to your safe space. A tornado may already be on the ground, and you may have only seconds to protect yourself.

Rep. Clint Moses (R-Menomonie), the lead author on both of the bills, has said he wants to help ensure the food children and others are eating is healthy. 
AB 180 would bar participants in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) — or, as it’s known in Wisconsin, FoodShare — from purchasing soda and candy with their benefits. Under the bill, the Wisconsin Department of Health Services (DHS) would need to submit a waiver to the federal government for approval to make the change to the program.
Kennedy wants a similar policy implemented nationwide, and so far several states, including Arkansas and Indiana, have asked the Trump administration for a waiver that would remove soda and candy from SNAP eligibility.
Moses said at a hearing on the proposal earlier this month that by allowing people to purchase those items with FoodShare, Wisconsin is “facilitating consumption of harmful, additive-filled foods” and that “instead, we should be supporting healthy, sustainable food choices for [people’s] overall health of individuals, the health of our society as a whole.”
Moses argued the restrictions wouldn’t be a novel idea, since people already can’t use their SNAP benefits to purchase alcohol, pet food and other items. SNAP currently also can’t be used for hot foods (such as a meal at a restaurant), supplements and vitamins and nonfood items. 
He also compared it to the Women, Infants & Children (WIC) program, the assistance program that provides free healthy foods, breastfeeding support, nutrition education and referrals to other services to income-eligible pregnant and postpartum women, breastfeeding moms and children under 5.
“Most government money has strings attached to what that money can be used for,” Moses told the Assembly Public Benefits Reform Committee. “Adding this provision is no different than the special supplemental nutrition program for the WIC program… WIC basically includes a list of good items or essentials that people can buy that does not include any of this other stuff.”
Expert: SNAP, WIC have different goals
UW-Madison food insecurity expert Judith Bartfeld says, however, that the programs are fundamentally different. WIC serves as a narrowly targeted nutrition program that provides specific foods for a defined group of nutritionally at-risk people. 
The SNAP program, meanwhile, is designed to serve as a “supplement to existing income” and “to fill the gap between a USDA estimate of what is needed to meet a household’s food needs and the amount a given household is assumed to be able to spend on food out of current income,” Bartfeld wrote in an email to the Examiner.
She said periodic state and federal attempts to restrict SNAP have been unsuccessful in the past, in part because of a “reluctance to upset the balance for a program that is a backbone of the safety net.” 
According to DHS, the SNAP program helps nearly 700,000 Wisconsinites put food on their tables annually. A USDA study from 2016, the most recent year, found that “there were no major differences in the expenditure patterns of SNAP and non-SNAP households, no matter how the data were categorized,” and that similar to other families, SNAP recipients spend about 20 cents of every dollar on sweetened drinks, desserts, salty snacks, candy and sugar. 
“It’s intended to provide extra resources to support buying food at the store — and its effectiveness in reducing food insecurity is well documented,” Bartfeld said. “There have long been concerns that restricting how benefits can be used would make things more complicated for retailers, more stigmatizing for participants, unlikely to translate into meaningful health improvements, and would risk reducing participation and jeopardizing the well-documented benefits of SNAP on food security.”
In addition, she said, “identifying specific foods that are healthy or unhealthy is much more complicated in practice than it sounds.” 
Bartfeld said SNAP combats food insecurity because it provides additional resources to low income people and has become “less stigmatizing and easier to use.” Restrictions, she said, could end up having a negative effect.  
“If putting restrictions on SNAP ends up making it stigmatizing for participants, more complicated for retailers or opens the door to an increasingly constrained program, there are real concerns it may become less effective as an anti-hunger program — which of course would have negative health outcomes; this is why the anti-hunger community has long opposed bans such as this, and considered food bans as a line better not crossed,” Bartfeld said.
FoodShare cuts would cost Wisconsin $314 million a year, state health department reports

Bartfeld said it’s also unclear if a ban would improve health. Despite attempts to model health effects of a SNAP soda ban, she said, there is no empirical evidence proposed bans would meaningfully change diets or improve health outcomes.
“In contrast, there is real-world evidence that incentivizing healthy food purchases can modestly impact food choices,” Bartfeld said. “And SNAP has a nutrition education program (SNAP-Ed, which goes by FoodWise in Wisconsin), that appears to increase healthy eating — even as, ironically, that funding is currently at risk.”
The GOP-bill that passed the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday included “some of the largest cuts in the program’s history” the SNAP program, according to CNBC. 
The bill would expand work requirements to qualify for benefits, likely leading to reduced participation, cut federal funding and leave it up to states to fill in the gaps and it would entirely eliminate funding for the education program. According to Wisconsin DHS, the cuts would cost the state approximately $314 million every year and would put 90,000 people at risk of losing benefits. The bill now goes to the Senate.
Punishing low-income Wisconsinites?
Bartfeld said this is one of the challenges with some of the recent “health-focused” SNAP proposals across the county as the other proposed cuts and restrictions to the program are unrelated or “often run counter to health.” 
“That interest in benefit cuts is happening in tandem with increasing attention to food choices does mean that food programs are at the center of the action, and it can make it challenging to differentiate proposals that are really about health from those that are more fundamentally about regulating the low income [population] and paring back assistance,” Bartfeld said. 
Moses during his testimony described the proposal as part of a “national movement basically to really make our food supply healthier.” He said it shouldn’t be partisan and noted former First Lady Michelle Obama’s campaign to improve school meals. 
“I expect to receive full support from not just the Legislature but the governor as well,” Moses said. 
Democrats on the committee didn’t appear on board with the legislation. Rep. Ryan Clancy (D-Milwaukee) expressed concerns about the legislation focusing on low-income Wisconsinites and including unclear, arbitrary definitions.
Clancy asked Moses about low-income families using benefits to celebrate Halloween and special occasions. Moses replied that “if their kids really want candy, they can go into the neighbor’s house then they could trick or treat, and they’d probably get all the candy they want, but the benefit would be that the taxpayers wouldn’t be paying for it.”
“People that are on SNAP… they are taxpayers as well,” Clancy said, “so I don’t want to categorize folks who are experiencing, hopefully, temporary poverty from being taxpayers. They’re chipping in for, you know, health care benefits and everything else.” He added, “We’re, I think, just targeting low-income people with this.” 
Clancy demonstrated his point by pulling out a bottle of Snickers-flavored iced coffee, a seltzer water and, at one point, a cup of ice cream and a bottle of root beer. He poured the root beer into the ice cream, saying the milk in it would make it acceptable to purchase under the definitions in the bill. The definition for “soft drink” is “a beverage that contains less than 0.5 percent of alcohol and that contains natural or artificial sweeteners” and “does not include a beverage that contains milk or milk products; soy, rice, or similar milk substitutes; or more than 50 percent vegetable or fruit juice by volume.” 
“A root beer float is totally fine right? By taking this sugary thing, adding it to another sugary thing, this is now legal for somebody to use their FoodShare benefits,” Clancy said. 
Committee Chair Rep. Dan Knodl (R-Germantown) told Clancy to stop, saying that the hearing “isn’t a cooking show.” 
Banning additives in school meals
Another bill — AB 226 — would target “ultraprocessed” foods in schools by banning certain ingredients from meals, “Ultraprocessed foods” were one of the top concerns recently outlined by Kennedy and a report the Trump administration commissioned, and Kennedy has expressed interest in banning other additives as well.
Among the additives the bill identifies are brominated vegetable oil, potassium bromate, propylparaben, azodicarbonamide and red dye No. 3, which can be found in candy, fruit juices, cookies and other products.
Moses told lawmakers on the Assembly Education Committee that additives named in the bill are either in the process of being banned by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or have been subject of peer-reviewed studies that found links to adverse side effects if consumed in significant enough amounts. For example, Red No. 3 and brominated vegetable oil are both no longer approved for use in food by the FDA. 
“Our school lunches should not be filled with substances that negatively affect our students’ health, even including their mental health,” Moses told the committee.
Moses said the bill would “bypass the need for federal action while not forcing schools to risk loss of federal funds to pay for existing school lunch programs.” He also noted that other states, including California, are also working to ban the ingredients.
The bill would go into effect on July 1, 2027.
An earlier version of the bill only included free- and reduced-price meals, but it was amended after concerns from the Department of Public Instruction and the School Nutrition Association of Wisconsin. Both now support the bill. 
The Department of Public Instruction said the legislation aligns with positive trends in nutrition. 
“With an increased focus on farm-to-school programs and the use of local food, school nutrition programs are helping to improve the nutritional value of meals,” Kim Vercauteren, policy initiatives advisor for the DPI Division for Finance and Management, said in testimony. “Many schools and school nutrition vendors are already committed to providing meals that utilize unprocessed foods, which can be enjoyed without harmful, nutritionally useless additives. These programs not only encourage the use of healthy food, but educate students on healthy lifelong choices.” 
Targeted additives not common in schools
Members of the Healthy School Meals For All Coalition told the Wisconsin Examiner that they support the proposal, but also they hope it isn’t the only thing that lawmakers do to help improve school meals. The coalition of school food stakeholders has been advocating for free school meals for all Wisconsin students and for improving the quality of food served to students.
“We appreciate the fact that they’re looking out for the well-being of our students and see the work that we do,” School Nutrition Association of Wisconsin President Kaitlin Tauriainen said in an interview. “We’re hoping that some of these steps will allow us to build more of a bridge so we can understand each other’s point of view — whether that means taking steps to grant more access to food for kids or jumping right into the full meals for all free meals for all, which is something you know we certainly want.”
Tauriainen said that school nutrition professionals are focused on feeding students the healthiest food possible, although the ingredients listed in the bill already aren’t common in school meals. 
“I would say the majority of our manufacturers that we’ve talked to don’t have those additives in their food,” Tauriainen, who is the child nutrition coordinator for the Ashwaubenon School District, said. “So it’s really kind of a non-issue.”
Allison Pfaff Harris, farm to school director with REAP Food Group, a Madison-based nonprofit, said she appreciates that the bill is trying to address the school food “supply side.” She said, however, that school nutrition programs need support in moving away from other processed ingredients not mentioned in the bill. 
Operating on limited budgets, school nutrition programs “turn to those quicker ingredients, which are going to be more processed foods,” Pfaff Harris said, adding that “not all processed foods have those food additive ingredients.”
Pfaff Harris suggested pairing Moses’ bill with other improvements. She said the “big ask” for the coalition is no-cost school meals, but smaller steps would also be significant. Guaranteeing that the breakfast reimbursement for schools is 15 cents per meal could improve the supply chain and nutrition programs, she said. DPI prorates payments because it lacks funding to pay the full cost; Pfaff Harris said the current reimbursement rate is about 7 cents. 
“This is one piece of the puzzle, but it’s a small piece in the giant puzzle,” Pfaff Harris said. 
Pfaff Harris said the discussion about healthy meals is also challenging because there have been recent federal decisions cutting resources that help schools serve fresh ingredients. Wisconsin was set to receive $11 million in funding for “Local Food for Schools” programs, but it was cut by the Trump administration. 
“You’re having these bills introduced, which is a good thing, but … from my perspective, if we really wanted to make a difference in school nutrition programs and help them to be able to do more scratch cooking and semi-scratch and fresh ingredients, it’s getting that funding back,”  Pfaff Harris said.
Rep. Francesca Hong (D-Madison) asked Moses about free school meals and other proposals, saying it could improve his bill. 
Moses said her suggestions seemed like a completely different bill altogether.
“It doesn’t matter to me if it’s reduced or people are paying for it. I want [the meals] to be safe …” Moses said. “Essentially, it’s not the intent of this bill.”

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)New Jersey laws allow shopkeepers, librarians, harbormasters, casino security officers, public transit workers, and just about anyone else to make a citizen’s arrest if they spot a scofflaw they think should be brought to justice.
But a commission tasked with ensuring the Garden State’s statutes remain relevant wants legislators to revoke the authority of most citizens to detain suspected lawbreakers.
The “anachronistic” statutes that allow citizen’s arrests don’t spell out how much suspicion is necessary to warrant action, how much force a citizen can use to detain someone, how long a suspect can be held, and what liability a citizen has if they wrongly apprehend someone, the New Jersey Law Revision Commission said in a new report.
Without that clarity, citizen’s arrests could result in civil rights violations and threaten the safety of both the arrestee and arrester, given that ordinary citizens lack the training and experience to detain someone, said Barbara Brosnan Rivera, the commission’s counsel.
“Over the years, as organized police forces have developed, the need for citizen’s arrest has decreased,” Rivera said Thursday during the commission’s monthly meeting.
People have misinterpreted or abused citizen’s arrest laws with fatal consequences, Rivera said. She pointed to the 2020 death of Ahmaud Arbery, a jogger who was killed in Georgia by three men who said they chased and killed him because they suspected he was a burglar. The men were eventually convicted of hate crimes and imprisoned, and lawmakers subsequently repealed Georgia’s citizen’s arrest law.
Most states have citizen’s arrest statutes, but some, including New York and South Carolina, are now considering amending them because of similar concerns, Rivera said.
The commission first identified New Jersey citizen’s arrest statutes as ripe for review early in the pandemic, when questions arose about whether citizens could arrest people who ignored Gov. Phil Murphy’s mask mandate and other social distancing rules, Rivera said. At that time, Murphy discouraged citizen’s arrests, saying anyone wanting to bring a mask flouter to account should alert police.
New Jersey laws on citizen’s arrests date back to the 1800s, with at least one remaining “virtually unchanged” for over a century, the commission’s report says.
They empower citizens to detain someone they see commit disorderly conduct offenses, which are minor transgressions such as lewdness, harassment, fighting, and cursing in a public place. The laws also authorize shopkeepers to hold suspected shoplifters and librarians to detain people they suspect of stealing books and other borrowable materials, Rivera said.
They further grant arrest authority to “special officers” who suspect wrongdoing, including harbormasters, people working for stud farms and agricultural fairs and exhibitions, constables, and those working to capture prison escapees and parole absconders.
The commission’s report recommends that legislators disempower citizens and librarians from making citizen’s arrests and more explicitly define the authority and responsibilities of shopkeepers who want to detain suspected thieves.
The report also urges lawmakers to revoke arrest authority from “special officers” and revoke that term from statutes because it “appears to be a vestige of a bygone era.” Lawmakers already abolished constables in a law Gov. Phil Murphy signed last year, Rivera added.
Commissioners, though, noted that some agencies still might use special officers and need detention authority, such as harbormasters who discover illicit cargo or missing permits and licenses on boats they inspect.
So the commissioners directed staff to seek guidance from law enforcement on whether any special officers still operate in New Jersey and which among them should retain arrest authority.
Commissioner Edward Hartnett, a professor at Seton Hall University’s law school, also predicted the report could receive “policy pushback” from gun-rights advocates who might insist on a right to make citizen’s arrests.
“It seems to me that one strand of the gun-rights movement is that people need to be able to act, precisely because they can’t count on public authorities to act in time,” Hartnett said.
The report is tentative, and the commission is still accepting public comments it will consider before issuing a final report. Comments can be emailed to bbr@njlrc.org, faxed to (973) 648-3123, or mailed to 153 Halsey St., 7th floor, Box 47016, Newark, N.J. 07102.

(Photo courtesy of Scott and Julia Whitnall)Like many moderate-income workers, public school teachers Julia and Scott Whitnall didn’t think they’d become homeowners in their early 30s. Especially in California.
“We never felt homeownership was in our cards. But we did it!” Julia Whitnall said. “We’re extremely happy.”
The couple moved May 16 to a $509,000 two-bedroom house in Ripon, east of San Francisco in the Central Valley region.
It wasn’t easy. Despite a relatively high combined income of $140,000 from their nearby jobs, they had to compromise on size and take on extra work at summer camps to pull it off. Then they had to exercise patience as the sellers struggled to find a new home.
High interest rates and high prices in a still-competitive housing market continue to make it tough for first-time buyers, even those with good but moderate incomes.
On a national level, households making $75,000 to $100,000 — typical of teachers, nurses and skilled trades workers in many states — face a daunting lack of homes they can afford. That’s according to new research by the National Association of Realtors and Realtor.com based on listings in March of this year compared with 2024. However, the numbers showed an encouraging 20% increase in homes for sale, affordable or not.
Despite more houses for sale, those moderate-income buyers — which the report called “middle- and upper-middle-income buyers” — are much more hard-pressed to find an affordable home than they were in 2019, when almost half the homes on the market were affordable to them. This year they can afford only 21.2% of homes on the market — a slight improvement compared with 20.8% in 2024, according to the report.
It also found that a few states are improving in affordability for people in the $75,000-to-$100,000 income range. But many states are not.
The largest affordability gaps are in California, Hawaii, Idaho, Massachusetts and Montana, where such households can afford fewer than 12% of houses on the market. By contrast, they could afford about half the houses for sale in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Ohio and West Virginia.
There’s progress in states that are adding more housing at moderate price points: Arizona, Colorado, Delaware, Florida and Utah, according to the Realtors report.
Balanced markets
Nationwide, to get home markets back in line with moderate-income families, the United States needs 416,000 more homes for sale at or below $255,000, according to the report.
“In many places, we’re still seeing a huge mismatch between income levels and what’s available to buy for moderate-income families,” said Nadia Evangelou, the National Association of Realtors’ senior economist and director of real estate research.
“We are no longer in crisis mode, but we are still very far from where we need to be. We can’t fix it overnight. It will take years,” Evangelou said.
Heather, who asked not to share her last name for privacy reasons, said she can’t even think of buying a house near her job on Long Island, New York. She makes more than $100,000 as a registered nurse and her family makes $170,000 with her husband’s job in building maintenance. But $4,400 in rent and $2,000 in monthly day care costs for three children have them living paycheck to paycheck.
“We can’t even afford a small car repair, let alone a mortgage in our hometown” of Ronkonkoma in Suffolk County, Heather said. Their jobs exposed her and her husband to risks in the pandemic that her neighbors avoided with remote work, she said. But she now feels like she’s in worse shape financially than she was in 2019 and considers moving away.
“All of our hard work feels like it was for nothing,” Heather said. “It’s disheartening that we can’t afford to live where we grew up, but that’s the reality we are facing.”
Some states can still be a refuge of affordability.
Ashley and Tristan Jonas bought a $252,000 house in northwest Ohio after three years of getting shut out by higher or all-cash offers. Ashley Jonas, 32, trained as a teacher but now works in skilled trades as a project coordinator for a countertop company, and the couple makes about $140,000 with Tristan Jonas’ job as a computer programmer.
“We happened to hit the market at the right time in 2025,” Ashley Jonas said. “We bid on this house just as [President Donald] Trump was announcing tariffs. I think a lot of people were holding their coin purses. We weren’t.”
Help for teachers
Teachers, who generally make less than nurses or trades workers, are particularly squeezed. Some states, facing teacher shortages in local schools, are working to raise pay. And increasingly, some schools and hospitals are providing housing to lure more teachers and nurses.
“We lose so many teachers because they can’t find housing here,” said Autumn Rivera, a 20-year teaching veteran and 2022 Colorado Teacher of the Year. Despite her experience and credentials, Rivera said she can’t contemplate buying even a townhouse in the rural resort town of Glenwood Springs, where she teaches.
Prices for those townhouses now start in the $700,000 range, more than twice what they were when she last considered buying in 2019. Rivera feels lucky to have a reasonable rent by sharing a home with its owner, but many teachers in her Roaring Fork Schools need the 117 apartments provided by the district with affordable rent, she said. The district hopes the apartments will allow teachers to save up for a home; it has also built 14 houses for staff with Habitat for Humanity and Holy Cross Energy.
One way to make homebuying more feasible for teachers is to pay them more — a strategy that paid off for New Mexico, one of the few bright spots in a different report on teachers’ inability to afford housing, which was published this month by the National Council on Teacher Quality, a research and advocacy group.
Beginning teachers in Albuquerque saw a 60% increase in pay between 2019 and 2025, which fell just short of a 65% jump in home prices, according to the report. The report credited a state law that raised teacher salaries, including starting pay, by $10,000.
“We’re dealing with the issue of teachers being able to live in the communities where they’re actually working,” said state Rep. Joy Garratt, a Democrat who sponsored a new law, signed in April, that sets higher minimum salaries for teachers effective July 1.
Detroit schools also gave teachers with advanced degrees a pay boost of up to 50% since 2019, about the same increase as home prices, according to the report from the National Council on Teacher Quality. Albuquerque and Detroit are on the report’s list of most affordable places for beginning teachers to live.
But nationally, on average, experienced teachers who started in 2019 are less able to afford a home now than when they began, according to the report.
“Teacher pay has gone up 24% in the last five years, which some might say is solid growth, and yet the increase in house for purchase has gone up 47%,” said Heather Peske, the organization’s president.
“Housing prices are critical to being able to attract and keep great teachers,” Peske said. “People will be leaving the profession trying to find something that pays enough for housing. And bottom line, kids won’t get as good an education.”

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Frustrated with religious content and polarizing language added to Oklahoma academic standards, some parents say they plan to opt their children out of “ideologically charged” social studies lessons in public schools.
Families and liberal advocates across the state, relying on parental rights laws that Republicans championed, are drafting letters to exempt their children from new social studies content that conservative leaders enacted this year.
“Now that it’s being codified and now that it’s being brought more into the public eye, the liberals have realized that those are our rights too,” Tulsa parent Lauren Parker said.
The “biggest glaring red flag” in the new social studies standards, Parker said, is language that casts doubt on the integrity of the 2020 presidential election. President Donald Trump has refused to concede defeat to Democrat Joe Biden in the 2020 race, despite courts across the country dismissing Trump’s lawsuits claiming election fraud.
Under the new standards, Oklahoma high school U.S. history classes will be required to have students “identify discrepancies” in the 2020 election results, including the “sudden halting of ballot-counting in select cities in key battleground states, the security risks of mail-in balloting, sudden batch dumps, an unforeseen record number of voters, and the unprecedented contradiction of ‘bellwether county’ trends.”

State Superintendent Ryan Walters quietly added these claims without acknowledging them until after the standards passed a vote by the Oklahoma State Board of Education. Half of the board later said they were unaware of the new content when they voted on it.
A lawsuit in Oklahoma County District Court is challenging whether the Education Department and the board followed proper procedures when approving the standards.
Parker said she contacted her home district, Tulsa Public Schools, to opt her children out of being taught about “election fraud that never happened.”
She also objected to Walters’ new requirements that Oklahoma schools incorporate Bible stories and Jesus’ teachings into their curriculum — an effort she views as Christian nationalism and religious indoctrination.
“I​t literally was one of the most painful experiences of my life growing up in Christianity, and so it’s the last thing that I want my daughters to learn about in school,” Parker said. “Of course, we discuss things, but it’s just that this isn’t about history and facts. It’s about pushing their faith on us, and that’s unacceptable. It’s un-American.”
Walters said he implemented the biblical content not to convert students to Christianity, but to ensure they understand the beliefs that inspired America’s core principles and that influenced the country’s founding fathers.
It’s “concerning that parents would opt their kids out of understanding American history,” Walters said Thursday, but it’s a choice they have a right to make. 
“We want parents to have opt-outs,” Walters said. “We want parents to be able to make those decisions. I think that’s a bad decision on their part.”

Local organization We’re Oklahoma Education, or WOKE, is distributing sample opt-out letters through social media. Members of the group are known for regularly attending state Board of Education meetings and protesting Walters.
The organization has about 200 active volunteers in Oklahoma and 1,000 followers on its social media and email lists, director Erica Watkins said. 
Many of them are parents frustrated with Walters’ far-right brand of politics and the “ideologically charged” content he inserted into Oklahoma’s academic standards, said Watkins, a mother of two students in Jenks Public Schools. 
WOKE, a tongue-in-cheek reference to the label Republicans apply to left-leaning opponents, formed as a liberal counter to Moms for Liberty, a conservative national group also focused on education policy.
“If you believe parents know best, then that applies to all parents,” Watkins said. “And so that’s why we went ahead and used the channels that they put in place to push back against some of their more indoctrinating things that they’re putting into our schools.”
Watkins said her family isn’t religious, so she intends to exempt her children from new standards teaching the Bible. 
She said the 2020 election language is also out of the question.
“I don’t want my kids hearing that,” Watkins said. “That’s propaganda, and I don’t think it’s appropriate to be taught in school.”
Stillwater Public Schools parent Saralynn Boren, a WOKE member, said the group first started drafting opt-out letters after Walters invited public schools to use “pro-America kids content” from the conservative media entity PragerU.
The letters also invite parents to opt out of conservative content from Hillsdale College, Turning Point USA and even from “any interaction” with Walters himself. 
The group extended the letter template to add social studies standards on Judeo-Christian values, God, the Bible, the 2020 election and other topics. Watkins said they did so after the Republican majority in the state Legislature declined to take action on the academic standards.
A GOP-led attempt to disapprove the standards emerged in the state Senate, but the chamber’s Republican caucus decided to allow the new content to pass after having a closed-door meeting with Walters.
The Senate’s leader, President Pro Tem Lonnie Paxton, R-Tuttle, said he is supportive of parents who are now choosing to opt out of the standards.
“I think we give parents the ability to opt out of lots of things,” Paxton said. “If that’s what they want to opt out of, I would certainly support them being able to do that.”

Oklahoma law guarantees parents the right to direct their minor children’s education and moral or religious training. Parents are allowed to withdraw their children from any learning material or activity on moral or religious grounds. 
Boren, of Stillwater, said her past opt-out requests over PragerU were “well received” by her children’s district.
Stillwater district spokesperson Barry Fuxa said families always have had the right to choose an alternative assignment or learning material. He told Oklahoma Voice the district has not yet received any opt-out requests over new social studies standards.
“At this time, our response to families with concerns would be to ask them to give us time to learn more about the standards and to allow our admin and teacher teams time to develop plans of how the standards will be implemented in our curriculum,” he said.
Tulsa Public Schools also upholds parents’ rights to review instructional materials, both under state law and school board policy, the district said in a statement through its spokesperson, Luke Chitwood. 
Tulsa will spend the 2025-26 school year selecting instructional materials that align with the new social studies standards and will implement the new content in 2026-27, Chitwood said. That selection process will involve teachers, parents and community members, he said.
More parental engagement in education is a positive thing, said Senate Minority Leader Julia Kirt, D-Oklahoma City. 
But Kirt said she’s concerned political divisions are becoming wider. The new academic standards, as well as other efforts supporting state-funded religious education, could be a wedge driving Oklahomans further apart.
“If we have separate schools for everybody who has different beliefs, we’re going to have some real challenges about living together and working together and having an economy together,” Kirt said. “So, I’m worried about how that’s going to turn out. But do I want my child learning inaccurate information in their classroom? No, I don’t.”

Brad Little said he had thoughts on the “big, beautiful bill” advancing through Congress.
To extend 2017 tax cuts, the bill would deeply cut federal spending for programs, including Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. 
Speaking to reporters, Little said he wondered how it would impact Idaho.
“I don’t want to be in a position to where the big, beautiful bill passes, and myself and all my fellow governors are going to be back there whining and crying,” he said on May 12.

But he soon added that Idaho would be better prepared than other states — because of the state’s stockpiled rainy day fund, and investments in facilities, schools and roads.
“I’ve said this many times: With what we’ve done in the past, where we are, almost anything that happens at the federal level is going to impact the other 49 states more than it is Idaho,” Little said. “And I feel that about the big, beautiful bill.”
Last week, he threw his support behind the bill — also backed by President Donald Trump. The bill passed the U.S. House and now heads to the U.S. Senate.
It could shift millions of dollars in SNAP costs onto Idaho.

 ‘We’re doing a good job … why would you penalize us?’ Idaho Gov. Little says

SNAP is a federal program that states run. The federal government pays for benefits. But states already chip in somewhat, by splitting administrative costs with the federal government. 
“States have really very little flexibility or options in how to administer it,” the Idaho governor’s budget chief, Lori Wolff, told the Idaho Capital Sun in an interview.
But where states do have flexibility, Idaho opts toward oversight, she explained — like limiting exemptions for SNAP work requirements, prosecuting fraud cases, and ensuring payments are made accurately. Idaho has been among the top three states for payment accuracies for years, Wolff said. 
In Little’s remarks a couple weeks ago, he leaned on Idaho’s metrics, too.

Idaho is one of the most efficient states at running the federal SNAP program, he said, citing a recent report that showed Idaho had a range of extra program accountability measures than other states. 
“That’s one of the things I’m worried about, is they categorically tell all the states, ‘We’re going to cut your program by such and such,’” Idaho’s governor said. “And I says, ‘We’re doing a good job. We’ve got the highest compliance rate, the least amount of fraud. Why would you penalize us?’”
Last week, Little and 19 other Republican governors endorsed the bill, two days before it passed the U.S. House with only support from congressional Republicans. 
Changes are expected in the U.S. Senate. But as it stands now, the bill would benefit wealthy taxpayers more while decreasing resources for low-income families, an analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found.  
 Bill could increase Idaho’s SNAP costs by at least $18M, state health official says

Idaho has the second lowest SNAP payment error rate in the nation, which is only behind South Dakota, according to the most recent data from the United States Department of Agriculture, or USDA. That figure measures “the accuracy of each state’s eligibility and benefit determinations,” USDA says.

The Gem State is among only seven states that would qualify for the lowest state cost-sharing for SNAP under the bill being considered in Congress, States Newsroom reported. The bill would require those states to pay for 5% of SNAP benefits, and require states with higher SNAP error rates to pay even more.
It could raise Idaho’s costs for SNAP by at least $18 million, Idaho Department of Health and Welfare spokesperson AJ McWhorter told the Sun. 
That requirement wouldn’t start until 2028. So that gives Idaho officials time to plan, he said. 
Idaho already pitches in some money for SNAP. Last year, Idaho spent more than $8 million to run the program, McWhorter said. 
But that is only a small fraction of what the program costs. Last year, Idaho’s SNAP program gave out $271 million in benefits to low-income families last year, he said. 
Less than 3.5% of Idaho’s SNAP payments were in error, USDA data shows. That’s around three times lower than the national average payment error rate, which was 11.7%.
“Idaho is often seen as a model for successful SNAP administration,” McWhorter said. “Federal policymakers can use us as an example for other states.”



 Idaho asks feds to ban candy, soda from SNAP 

The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare on May 16 asked the federal government for permission to ban candy and soda from being covered by the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.
This year, the Legislature required Health and Welfare to submit that waiver through House Bill 109.
Last week, Nebraska became the first state to receive approval for that type of waiver from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Nebraska Examiner reported. 
More than 3 million people would lose SNAP benefits under GOP bill, nonpartisan report says

In a news release, the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare cited USDA data to claim that about 20% of SNAP purchases nationally are for “sugary beverages and snacks.” 
The agency couldn’t immediately share the source for that claim. A USDA spokesperson directed the Idaho Capital Sun to a 2016 study that found “About 20 cents out of every dollar was spent on sweetened beverages, desserts, salty snacks, candy and sugar.”
The study has many limitations, and “should not be considered nationally representative,” the USDA spokesperson added. 
The American Heart Association says it supports Idaho’s move and is asking the USDA to quickly approve the waiver.
“The American Heart Association is committed to removing sugary drinks from SNAP, and we are proud to stand in support of Idaho’s efforts to do so over the soda industry’s unconscionable opposition,” American Heart Association CEO Nancy Brown said in a written statement.

(Photo courtesy of Scott and Julia Whitnall)Like many moderate-income workers, public school teachers Julia and Scott Whitnall didn’t think they’d become homeowners in their early 30s. Especially in California.
“We never felt homeownership was in our cards. But we did it!” Julia Whitnall said. “We’re extremely happy.”
The couple moved May 16 to a $509,000 two-bedroom house in Ripon, east of San Francisco in the Central Valley region.
It wasn’t easy. Despite a relatively high combined income of $140,000 from their nearby jobs, they had to compromise on size and take on extra work at summer camps to pull it off. Then they had to exercise patience as the sellers struggled to find a new home.
High interest rates and high prices in a still-competitive housing market continue to make it tough for first-time buyers, even those with good but moderate incomes.
On a national level, households making $75,000 to $100,000 — typical of teachers, nurses and skilled trades workers in many states — face a daunting lack of homes they can afford. That’s according to new research by the National Association of Realtors and Realtor.com based on listings in March of this year compared with 2024. However, the numbers showed an encouraging 20% increase in homes for sale, affordable or not.
Despite more houses for sale, those moderate-income buyers — which the report called “middle- and upper-middle-income buyers” — are much more hard-pressed to find an affordable home than they were in 2019, when almost half the homes on the market were affordable to them. This year they can afford only 21.2% of homes on the market — a slight improvement compared with 20.8% in 2024, according to the report.
It also found that a few states are improving in affordability for people in the $75,000-to-$100,000 income range. But many states are not.
The largest affordability gaps are in California, Hawaii, Idaho, Massachusetts and Montana, where such households can afford fewer than 12% of houses on the market. By contrast, they could afford about half the houses for sale in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Ohio and West Virginia.
There’s progress in states that are adding more housing at moderate price points: Arizona, Colorado, Delaware, Florida and Utah, according to the Realtors report.

 Balanced markets

Nationwide, to get home markets back in line with moderate-income families, the United States needs 416,000 more homes for sale at or below $255,000, according to the report.
“In many places, we’re still seeing a huge mismatch between income levels and what’s available to buy for moderate-income families,” said Nadia Evangelou, the National Association of Realtors’ senior economist and director of real estate research.
“We are no longer in crisis mode, but we are still very far from where we need to be. We can’t fix it overnight. It will take years,” Evangelou said.
Heather, who asked not to share her last name for privacy reasons, said she can’t even think of buying a house near her job on Long Island, New York. She makes more than $100,000 as a registered nurse and her family makes $170,000 with her husband’s job in building maintenance. But $4,400 in rent and $2,000 in monthly day care costs for three children have them living paycheck to paycheck.
“We can’t even afford a small car repair, let alone a mortgage in our hometown” of Ronkonkoma in Suffolk County, Heather said. Their jobs exposed her and her husband to risks in the pandemic that her neighbors avoided with remote work, she said. But she now feels like she’s in worse shape financially than she was in 2019 and considers moving away.
“All of our hard work feels like it was for nothing,” Heather said. “It’s disheartening that we can’t afford to live where we grew up, but that’s the reality we are facing.”
Some states can still be a refuge of affordability.
Ashley and Tristan Jonas bought a $252,000 house in northwest Ohio after three years of getting shut out by higher or all-cash offers. Ashley Jonas, 32, trained as a teacher but now works in skilled trades as a project coordinator for a countertop company, and the couple makes about $140,000 with Tristan Jonas’ job as a computer programmer.
“We happened to hit the market at the right time in 2025,” Ashley Jonas said. “We bid on this house just as [President Donald] Trump was announcing tariffs. I think a lot of people were holding their coin purses. We weren’t.”
 Help for teachers

Teachers, who generally make less than nurses or trades workers, are particularly squeezed. Some states, facing teacher shortages in local schools, are working to raise pay. And increasingly, some schools and hospitals are providing housing to lure more teachers and nurses.
“We lose so many teachers because they can’t find housing here,” said Autumn Rivera, a 20-year teaching veteran and 2022 Colorado Teacher of the Year. Despite her experience and credentials, Rivera said she can’t contemplate buying even a townhouse in the rural resort town of Glenwood Springs, where she teaches.
Prices for those townhouses now start in the $700,000 range, more than twice what they were when she last considered buying in 2019. Rivera feels lucky to have a reasonable rent by sharing a home with its owner, but many teachers in her Roaring Fork Schools need the 117 apartments provided by the district with affordable rent, she said. The district hopes the apartments will allow teachers to save up for a home; it has also built 14 houses for staff with Habitat for Humanity and Holy Cross Energy.
One way to make homebuying more feasible for teachers is to pay them more — a strategy that paid off for New Mexico, one of the few bright spots in a different report on teachers’ inability to afford housing, which was published this month by the National Council on Teacher Quality, a research and advocacy group.
Beginning teachers in Albuquerque saw a 60% increase in pay between 2019 and 2025, which fell just short of a 65% jump in home prices, according to the report. The report credited a state law that raised teacher salaries, including starting pay, by $10,000.
“We’re dealing with the issue of teachers being able to live in the communities where they’re actually working,” said state Rep. Joy Garratt, a Democrat who sponsored a new law, signed in April, that sets higher minimum salaries for teachers effective July 1.
Detroit schools also gave teachers with advanced degrees a pay boost of up to 50% since 2019, about the same increase as home prices, according to the report from the National Council on Teacher Quality. Albuquerque and Detroit are on the report’s list of most affordable places for beginning teachers to live.
But nationally, on average, experienced teachers who started in 2019 are less able to afford a home now than when they began, according to the report.
“Teacher pay has gone up 24% in the last five years, which some might say is solid growth, and yet the increase in house for purchase has gone up 47%,” said Heather Peske, the organization’s president.
“Housing prices are critical to being able to attract and keep great teachers,” Peske said. “People will be leaving the profession trying to find something that pays enough for housing. And bottom line, kids won’t get as good an education.”

Cow hunting could soon cease in six Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem herds, experts predict. Meanwhile, nearly half of hunter-killed bulls could be headed for the dumpster if disease rates reach projected levels. 
The post Golden era of northwest Wyoming elk hunting slides toward expected but undesirable end appeared first on WyoFile .","Droves of Wyoming residents will click over to Game and Fish’s website on June 19 to review their draw results for elk hunting tags. Thousands will be looking to see if they’ll have a shot at a cow or calf in the vast complex of mostly public land stretching across the southern Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. 
The opportunities there are great, and have been for a long time. The long-studied Jackson Elk Herd, although experiencing a stretch of relative scarcity, has been one of the largest elk herds in the American West for generations — a population held in check by targeting the females.
On the south end of Jackson Hole, the Fall Creek Herd has similarly thrived. This year, Wyoming’s offering 750 limited-quota tags that will give hunters a chance to put a cow or calf in the freezer in the two hunt areas, split by the Snake River, where the herd dwells.
The abundance continues farther south and east in the Afton, Piney, Pinedale and Upper Green River herds. Many hundreds more Wyoming residents will hand over $43 to vie for a chance at bagging a cow or calf elk during late-season hunts, when animals are down at lower elevations and easier to kill. 
It’s no secret that wapiti are thriving statewide. They’re doing so well, especially in places with lots of private land, it’s even problematic. Wildlife managers are going to great lengths to kill more female elk — the reproducers that drive the size of any ungulate herd.

But such abundance isn’t expected to last for six northwestern Wyoming herds. By around a decade from now, cow elk hunting might no longer be necessary, and, in fact, prohibited. Instead, a new force of nature would fill the herd-shrinking role that human hunters now play. 
That factor is chronic wasting disease. It’s an incurable, transmissible neurological condition that shrinks the lifespan of its wapiti hosts from 15 or so years down to just a few. Spread by always-lethal prions that can live in the environment for decades, it’s not always devastating for elk. Herds, even overpopulated ones like those in the Laramie Mountains, have lived with CWD at lower prevalence rates for decades.

But there’s a differentiating factor for the six herds where experts expect that cow hunting could soon end. For months at a time during the winter, thousands of these animals are parked on feedgrounds, eating hay and alfalfa in small spaces where scientists have learned that feeding drives up contact rates between animals and accelerates the spread of diseases. Chronic wasting disease is just now reaching the region, and the response so far, guided by a management plan, is to maintain the status quo. 
Many northwestern Wyoming elk hunters appear to be greeting the looming calamity with a shrug, said Hank Edwards, a retired wildlife health laboratory supervisor for the Wyoming Game and Fish Department.
“I have tried in so many of my presentations to get the message across that this is dire,” Edwards told WyoFile. “Yet, people just don’t get it. They say, ‘F*** it, I’ll get to hunt another 10 years, then I’ll be too old to hunt. Who cares?’” 
Hunter receptions
With the worst effects of CWD on feedground elk still years away, concerns among rank-and-file hunters are out there. But it hasn’t yet been cause for alarm. When the Game and Fish Commission solicited comments in response to its proposed elk hunting seasons for 2025, the public submitted several hundred remarks. But only a few comment writers encouraged precautionary steps to avert the likely worst outcomes of a disease that experts expect will decimate six elk herds within a decade, or two at most.
“I recommend lowering the objective. We need to kill some elk,” former Game and Fish Commissioner Mark Anselmi wrote about hunting seasons in Jackson Hole. “CWD has raised its head and [at] some point in [the] future, I would guess the refuge will quit feeding. Knock the population down by harvest while you can.”

Green River resident Bill Ames made a similar request. He called for reducing densities of feedground-dependent, overpopulated elk along the Wyoming Range’s Piney Front.
“I would like to see herd objectives reviewed with possible CWD impacts and reducing feedground dependency,” wrote Ames, who also asked for a late-season hunt on the footprint of a 33-acre feedground in the Bondurant area where an epidemic is incubating. “What can we do to put elk of the Dell Creek feedground in people’s freezers and avoid the slaughter of a high prevalence of CWD?” 
A Pinedale resident also sent in an unconventional idea to address feedground elk. Otherwise, there was little encouragement to tackle a disease threat that could upend Northwest Wyoming elk hunting as it is known today. 
Pavillion outfitter B.J. Hill, who runs hunts in the Jackson Hole area, denies that there’s a problem. 
“The CWD narrative is being driven by some of the Jackson managers and staff as well the [National Elk Refuge] employees,” Hill wrote in his comment letter. “It’s basically in-house activism unchecked.”

Outfitters like Hill have largely voiced support for keeping elk feeding going, regardless of CWD. He’s insisted in the past that expert projections are wrong. Other outfitters have said they’re open to closing feedgrounds, so long as state wildlife managers don’t lower their targeted herd sizes.
Lee Livingston, a past president of the Wyoming Outfitters and Guides Association, said he doesn’t see any easy answers to state and federal wildlife managers’ predicament. The feedground system is over a century old. It has separated elk herds from domestic cattle, propped up populations, insulated herds from the effects of bad winters and allowed them to cope with the loss of habitat from private land development.
“Unless you just did a wholesale slaughter of elk, I don’t see how you could shut down feedgrounds,” Livingston said at last week’s Wyoming Sportsperson Conservation Forum in Dubois. “If you’re going to shut down feedgrounds, then you need to come up with an alternative.” 
There have been small-scale efforts to do just that, like paying ranchers to host elk. 
Another alternative that’s being assessed is having fewer elk on the landscape in order to forgo feeding. Right-sizing herds to fit the natural winter range that’s available isn’t a popular idea — outfitters have signaled they’ll oppose it — but it’s the path that wildlife officials who understand disease dynamics predict will lead to the best outcomes for populations and elk hunting. 
Path of most destruction
Wildlife disease experts have gamed out what they expect is about to take place in the Jackson Elk Herd and other five feedground-region herds. The scientific inquiries were published by the U.S. Geological Survey in 2023 and 2024 in anticipation of changes to elk feeding sites on federal land. 
Elk populations and hunting opportunities decline under all scenarios analyzed, including the end of all cow hunting. The reason for the latter, USGS disease ecologist Paul Cross explained, is that the analysis assumed Wyoming would maintain its current elk herd size objectives, but that, by around year 10, the actual populations would tumble more than 20% below the goal. When that happens, wildlife managers’ standard response is to scale back or end cow hunting to allow the herds to grow.
While declines are expected regardless of management choices, the keep-feeding option shakes out the worst. 
“Our predictions are a 55% reduction in population size across the five herd units, excluding Jackson,” Cross told WyoFile.

Within 20 years, CWD prevalence in those still-fed herds is expected to reach 42%, he said. 
Those animals, for many hunters, will be headed for the trash instead of the freezer. There’s never been evidence of CWD crossing over to humans. But studies suggest there’s not an absolute barrier, and Game and Fish promotes Centers for Disease Control and World Health Organization guidance to not consume CWD-positive animals.
Expected rates of CWD among feedground elk are four times greater than the highest rates detected in Wyoming elk today. The Iron Mountain Herd, with just 10% prevalence, currently tops the charts in elk, according to the state’s latest assessment. 
Filmmaker Shane Moore, an avid elk hunter who grew up on a ranch in the Gros Ventre Range, understands the skepticism about the expert projections. 
“They are really admittedly nothing more than guesses,” said Moore, who sat on the working group that shaped Wyoming’s CWD plan. “But they’re guesses from very bright people — the most knowledgeable people.”

The eight wildlife disease experts who contributed to the USGS study include: Emily Almberg, Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks; Justin Binfet, Wyoming Game and Fish Department; Hank Edwards, Wyoming Game and Fish (now retired); Nathan Galloway, National Park Service; Glen Sargeant, U.S. Geological Survey; Brant Schumaker, University of Wyoming; Daniel Walsh, U.S. Geological Survey; and Ben Wise, Wyoming Game and Fish.
Moore is one of the few hunters who has vocally advocated for Wyoming to heed the scientific predictions. 
“Right now, we have only bad choices,” Moore said. “When you’re faced with two bad choices, that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t take the best of the bad choices. We haven’t, in my opinion.”

Political realities constrain Wyoming Game and Fish from making any sharp turns on elk feeding. The Wyoming Legislature passed a law in 2021 requiring feedground closures be vetted by the Wyoming Livestock Board and leaving the decisionmaking authority to the governor. And the agency’s feedground plan relies on developing tertiary herd-specific plans that require building consensus with pro-feeding parties. 
Moore laments that an issue that could jeopardize elk hunting’s future has become so politicized. 
“I think the sad reality is we’re not listening to the biologists in the community,” he said, “we’re listening to the politicians.” 
‘Real life test case’
Meanwhile, CWD is spreading steadily into the feedground region. Dead elk that tested positive were found last winter at four of the 21 sites, and there’s no knowing how many additional live infected elk were shedding the prions that spread the disease. 
“This is going to be a real life test case of model predictions and CWD dynamics in elk feedgrounds,” said Game and Fish’s Binfet — one of the experts who contributed to the USGS’ modeling. 
There’s no knowing what’s about to happen, he said. 
“CWD may not be the demise of elk in the GYE, as some folks fear,” Binfet said. “The other thing that would not surprise me is if feedgrounds contribute to a situation whereby we see CWD prevalence in elk skyrocket.”

Game and Fish retiree Edwards, the wildlife health laboratory supervisor who also contributed to the projections, is pessimistic. Over his decades on the job, he consistently saw how the feedgrounds spread disease. During one bad winter in the early 2000s, he said, brucellosis rates at the Alpine feedground spiked from 30% to 80% in one year. 
You could easily make the case, Edwards said, that CWD is going to be spread more effectively than brucellosis, which doesn’t flare up until fetuses are aborted in the spring. 
“As the snow melts, all those feces that have been buried and trampled become available,” he said. “The likelihood of transmission is going to increase.”
Edwards worries that elk hunters don’t grasp what’s about to hit them. 
“It may take a big increase in prevalence at Dell Creek or whatever feedground before the public really starts to take notice,” Edwards said. “Unfortunately by then, it’s going to be too late.” 
By too late, he means CWD will have already started the process of destroying the herds. The eye-opening changes it can inflict upon an ungulate population will likely be “permanent,” he said.  
“From all that we know about prion diseases,” Edwards said, “the populations are not going to recover.”

(Photo by New Jersey Monitor)The tax and spending bill the U.S. House approved last week targets a strategy states have used to boost the Medicaid dollars they get from the federal government. The measure would cap or freeze the taxes states levy on medical providers, potentially leaving states with major holes in their Medicaid budgets.
As a result, states would face the choice of either replacing the lost federal money with state dollars, scaling back services or providing coverage to fewer people.
Medicaid is a joint state-federal program, primarily for people with low incomes. For the traditional Medicaid population — children and their caregivers, people with disabilities and pregnant women — the federal government matches state Medicaid spending on a sliding scale, ranging from 50% for the wealthiest states to 77% for the poorest ones.
Consider a state that gets half of its Medicaid funding from the federal government. If that state collects $100 million by taxing providers, it can use $50 million of the revenue to draw down $50 million in federal matching funds, which it can use to expand Medicaid coverage to more people. Then it can take the remaining $50 million in revenue and use that money to draw down $50 million in federal dollars to pay providers more for caring for Medicaid patients.
Forty-nine states — all but Alaska — use the strategy. In 2018, the most recent year for which data is available, states relied on provider taxes to fund 17% of their Medicaid spending, up from 7% in 2008, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office.
As part of their effort to cut federal Medicaid spending by roughly $625 billion over the next decade, House Republicans have proposed capping the state provider taxes and freezing them in place, preventing states from raising them or implementing new ones in response to inflation. Under current law, states can levy taxes of up to 6% on tax providers’ net revenue. The GOP measure also would add work requirements for Medicaid recipients, a step that would save money by reducing the rolls.
A report from the Congressional Budget Office, the bipartisan research arm of Congress, says eliminating the taxes entirely could save the federal government hundreds of billions of dollars over the next decade.
Many conservatives say the taxes are an accounting trick that allows states to draw down money from the federal government without having to front their true share of the Medicaid program. Some have even called the provider taxes a “money laundering” scheme.
“States are gaming the system — creating complex tax schemes that shift their responsibility to invest in Medicaid and rob federal taxpayers,” Dr. Mehmet Oz, the administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, said in a May 12 news release.
Brian Blase, president of the Paragon Health Institute, a conservative policy group that is working with Republicans to formulate Medicaid cuts, described provider taxes as “a way that states and providers can rip off the federal government.”
“States need to have some accountability for the spending in their programs,” Blase said.
But advocates of these taxes, including state Medicaid directors and even the hospitals that pay the taxes, describe them as legal and legitimate financial tools that have helped providers cover essential services and states fund their Medicaid programs for years. The result of eliminating these taxes or freezing them, they say, will be hospital closures and service cuts.
“We don’t like to pay these taxes, but the alternative is resources or access to care aren’t there for that community,” said Jason Pray, vice president of legislative affairs at America’s Essential Hospitals, an association representing about 350 hospitals. “The state would more than likely have to then tax individuals to make up for that, to keep the services at the same level and keep the resources at the same level.”
Blase said the provider taxes allow hospitals to make windfall profits from the additional federal matching funds that flow back to them, representing a type of “corporate welfare.”
But Pray said often hospitals in his association are losing money. By allowing states to boost payments to hospitals and other providers that serve Medicaid patients, he said, the tax enables hospitals to stay open in the long run, not garner a windfall.
Pray also noted that in the past, support for the taxes has been bipartisan.
“Republicans for years have shown they support provider taxes and have understood the value of them,” he said.

Edwin Park, a research professor at the Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy, pointed out that some hospitals pay the tax and don’t get much back, because they serve few Medicaid patients. The hospitals that benefit most are the so-called safety net hospitals that do care for many low-income patients, he said.
Park said he is worried that once the strategy is off the table, states will have to cut their Medicaid spending to balance their budgets.
Jay Ludlam, deputy secretary for North Carolina Medicaid, is worried about that, too. In North Carolina, Ludlam said, almost all of the tax revenue the state collects from providers helps pay for Medicaid services.
“The money goes to providers when they provide services. It’s not special. It’s just another way that states tax themselves and put money into the program,” Ludlam told Stateline. “If it means that there’s going to be less money in Medicaid … we’ll have to cut eligibility, cut benefits, cut provider rates, in order to maintain the program.”

While the federal government protects animals listed under the Endangered Species Act, states are tasked with keeping the vast majority of other species out of the “emergency room.” Habitat loss, pollution and climate change are making that job much more difficult.
At the same time, states are finding it harder to count on the hunting and fishing revenues that have long funded most of their work. Agencies say they have more challenges than ever before, and less money to take them on.

In many states, lawmakers are rethinking the long-standing model for wildlife management. They’re considering new funding sources to make the agencies less reliant on license fees. They’re asking wildlife managers to expand their work beyond traditional “game” species, adding protections for threatened insects and other animals. And some are scrutinizing the commissions that have long governed wildlife management.
Some of the proposals have seen broad support from outdoors lovers who want to strengthen their wildlife agencies. Others have drawn opposition from sporting groups, who fear the new focus will diminish hunting and fishing opportunities.
“We’re seeing quite a bit of action this year,” said Logan Christian, wildlife and habitat specialist with the National Caucus of Environmental Legislators, a forum for state lawmakers. “We definitely have noticed that states are working on strengthening their wildlife agencies.”
As Stateline previously reported, New Mexico enacted the most sweeping overhaul this year. It renamed the Department of Game & Fish as the Department of Wildlife, giving it a more explicit focus on non-game species. Budget writers provided $10.5 million in new funding over the next three years to help threatened species. And lawmakers created a new process for appointing the agency’s commissioners, with guidelines ensuring a diversity of expertise and experience.
Wildlife advocates in other states say the New Mexico overhaul was a game changer. But lawmakers elsewhere are taking a more piecemeal approach.
 Reconsidering wildlife agencies’ funding model across the U.S.

Numerous states are reconsidering their wildlife agencies’ funding model.
“There’s definitely a growing awareness that the current management system is outdated and really unfit for 21st century challenges,” said Michelle Lute, executive director of Wildlife for All, a nonprofit focused on overhauling state wildlife governance. “State wildlife agencies are seeing that they can’t rely on hunting and fishing license fees to be able to do this work.”

Earlier this year, lawmakers in Utah enacted a new tax on wind and solar projects that will help fund the state’s wildlife agency. The revenue could double the department’s funding to protect non-game species, from $5 million to $10 million.
“We have a funding model in place for game species,” said Paul Thompson, administrator of the Species Protection Account with the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources. “Funding to work on some of our native species programs has been really hard to come by.”
The new revenue could allow the agency to invest in more biologists, conservation easements, watershed restoration projects and native fish hatchery programs. State Rep. Casey Snider, the Republican who sponsored the bill, argued that the clean energy sector should pay because its development is harming Utah’s habitat.
“Wind and solar projects have an outsized impact on [non-game] species, and they have not been contributing financially,” he said.
But industry leaders said the law will threaten the state’s energy development.
“[The measure will] severely strain the economics of an existing project and send a negative message to developers and the financial institutions that provide capital for these projects,” said Theresa Foxley, chief of staff to rPlus Energies, a renewable developer, in testimony to lawmakers.
Lawmakers in Oregon are considering an increase to the state’s tax on hotel and short-term rental stays to help fund non-game wildlife work. The proposal would bring in about $30 million annually. State Rep. Ken Helm, the bill’s Democratic sponsor, said the state wildlife agency’s division to manage non-game species “has come and gone over the last 30 years as funding is available.”
Growing concerns about climate change and biodiversity have created urgency to find a stable funding source, he said. Helm said the lodging tax is a logical source, because the state’s tourism industry is centered on the outdoors. He noted that Oregon’s natural resources agencies receive only a tiny fraction of the state’s general revenue.
Travel and tourism groups oppose the bill, arguing it could drive visitors elsewhere. Helm has also proposed a bill that would bring in wildlife funding through an income tax increase.
He said his message to fellow lawmakers was: “I’ve given you two ways to get the money we need for this agency. Nobody’s been able to come up with a better idea. Just pick one.”
The bill was heard in committee earlier this month, but has not yet advanced.
Idaho Fish and Game must evolve for the future of wildlife conservation

Meanwhile, lawmakers in Hawaii approved a “green fee” — a lodging tax increase of 0.75% that Democratic Gov. Josh Green’s office estimates will bring in $100 million annually to help protect the state from climate change. While the fund is not explicitly focused on wildlife, it’s expected to contribute to efforts such as coral reef restoration and watershed protection that will benefit important habitats.
State Rep. Amy Perruso, a Democrat who was among the advocates for a green fee, said the COVID-19 pandemic was a wakeup call.
“With the absence of tourists, we saw a lot more fish in the ocean, everything about the environment was so much more healthy because we didn’t have 10 million extra people,” she said. “If we’re going to do something to protect the environment, [tourism] is a logical connection.”
Washington state was among the first to significantly invest in non-game conservation through state tax revenue, with legislation enacted two years ago. The budget passed by lawmakers this session continues that work, with $14 million set aside for biodiversity and species recovery each of the next two years.
Lawmakers in Kansas and North Carolina also proposed using more general fund revenue for wildlife work, although those measures have not advanced.
 Should wildlife agencies include non-game species in their mission?

In other states, lawmakers are focused on expanding their wildlife agencies’ mission to more non-game species. Last year, Colorado gave wildlife managers the authority to manage insects and other invertebrates, as well as rare plants.
“Invertebrates are wildlife, and their conservation benefits the entire ecosystem, including the species [state wildlife officials] traditionally managed,” said Richard Reading, vice chair of the Colorado Parks and Wildlife Commission. “They do everything from creating our soils to filtering our water to pollinating the food we eat.”
Reading also serves as vice president of science and conservation at the Butterfly Pavilion, an insect zoo. He noted that studies are showing that many invertebrate species are in rapid decline. In addition to expanding the agency’s authority, lawmakers provided funding for six staff members to take on the additional work.
A similar bill in Nevada, focused on invertebrates, advanced through the Assembly’s natural resources committee.
“There’s definitely concerns about declines in pollinator species,” said Assemblymember Howard Watts, a Democrat who sponsored the bill. “Our wildlife agency can and should take proactive action to do research, surveys and habitat improvement to keep these species off the [endangered species list].”
Watts said the bill would allow wildlife managers to consider insects in state plans to protect imperiled species. He said the Nevada Department of Wildlife has requested an entomologist position if it’s asked to take on the additional species. Beyond that, he said, the measure would not require additional money, as it’s focused on voluntary, proactive work, rather than additional regulations.

Another bill in Pennsylvania would expand wildlife managers’ authority to include insects. That measure has been approved by the House Environmental and Natural Resources Protection Committee.
Sporting groups have largely been supportive of efforts to provide new funding sources to manage non-game species. But some are skeptical of plans to expand agencies’ mission without an increase in revenue.
“Most hunters and anglers understand that healthy game populations are dependent on ecosystem integrity,” said Devin O’Dea, Western policy and conservation manager with Backcountry Hunters & Anglers, a nonprofit focused on public lands. “But when you take a model that’s been developed with the intent of enforcing regulations for fish and game species, expand that scope without funding and additional capacity, it’s a recipe for something to fall off the plate.”
 Should wildlife, conservation commissions be overhauled?

Meanwhile, some legislators want to rethink the commission model that oversees wildlife governance. Critics say that governors often select commissioners who are hunting guides, farmers and political donors. Once appointed, they enact wildlife policies to suit their economic interests.
Florida state Rep. Anna V. Eskamani, a Democrat, drafted a bill that would overhaul the state’s Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. Her proposal would increase the board from seven to nine members. It would designate seats for scientists, conservationists, local officials, farmers, hunters and anglers.
“The commission has made decisions not based on science or conservation, but based on developers or landowners that engage in agricultural practices,” she said. “We tried to strike a balance to ensure there are voices with an environmental background, with a conservation and wildlife background, with an academic background.”
The bill did not advance, but Eskamani said grassroots support is building for systemic changes in wildlife management.
Some sporting groups are more wary of commission overhaul proposals.
“We have seen examples where proposed changes to commissions were politically motivated or motivated by anti-hunting and anti-angling interests,” said Kent Keene senior manager for Western states and agriculture policy with the Congressional Sportsmen’s Foundation, a group that promotes hunting and fishing priorities on Capitol Hill. “When those changes are focused on science-based needs, then the sportsmen’s community has a long history of supporting those steps to ensure we are protecting our heritage.”
Some hunting and fishing groups have emphasized that the expanded mission should come with additional funding, so agencies aren’t stretched thin. Keene noted that hunters and anglers pay an excise tax on the purchase of gear, which provides an important funding source for wildlife agencies. Some have proposed a similar “backpack tax” on gear for hikers, birdwatchers and others.
Another proposal in New Hampshire would give the wildlife agency’s executive director the authority to make policy decisions, relegating the Fish and Game Commission to an advisory body. That bill did not advance.

Nebraska judges have routinely gotten salary bumps since 2005, with annual July 1 increases in all but 2018. Even then, to make up for it, judges got two raises in 2019: Jan. 1 and July 1.
This year, Legislative Bill 513, from State Sen. Carolyn Bosn of Lincoln, as chair of the Legislature’s Judiciary Committee, seeks to offer 1.5% salary raises in each of the next two fiscal years — on July 1 and again July 1, 2026. Under LB 513, which is one vote away from passing, the seven justices on the Nebraska Supreme Court would be paid $228,431.18 on July 1. This would rise to $231,857.65 on July 1, 2026.

Recent history of Nebraska judicial salaries
History of judicial, executive, legislative salaries


The increases would cost taxpayers about $1.5 million and leave the state with about $1.1 million in wiggle room for any other budget priorities for the next two years.
Remaining judges are paid a percentage of what Supreme Court justices are paid:

Court of Appeals (six judges): 95%, currently $213,802.58.
District Courts (58 judges): 92.5%, currently $208,176.20.
Separate Juvenile Courts (12 judges, Douglas, Lancaster and Sarpy Counties): 92.5%, currently $208,176.20.
Workers’ Compensation Court (seven judges): 92.5%, currently $208,176.20.
County Courts (58 judges): 90%, currently $202,549.82.




Under state law, members of the Nebraska Tax Equalization and Review Commission also get salary and benefit increases when state judges do.
While largely a consensus issue, LB 513 has drawn pushback from mostly left-leaning senators who question the increases amid the state’s ongoing budget woes and ask whether the funds should be diverted to other priorities. 
The governor’s staff, too, has noted judicial salaries are already nationally competitive. His line-item vetoes of other judicial branch spending remain unresolved.
State senators last got a salary increase, from $4,800 to $12,000, in January 1989, which is baked into the Nebraska Constitution and harder to change. Constitutional officers, such as the governor, attorney general and secretary of state, last got raises in 1991, 2003 and 2007. Legislative efforts to increase lawmaker or constitutional officer pay have likely stalled for the year.

Value of a diverse judiciary
Bosn, a former prosecutor, described the “modest increase” in LB 513 as appropriate for the hardworking judiciary. She said that 1.5% raises are less than half what other state employees are getting in the next two-year state budget and about 1.2% of inflation for the Midwest for the past year. 
Part of the importance, Bosn said, is in encouraging applications for a diverse judicial branch, as salaries for private attorneys can eclipse those of public servants. As a result, many applicants come from local county attorneys offices or the Nebraska Attorney General’s Office.
“When you have a diverse group of individuals who are the judges, they can work together, they can have those conversations and try and come to the best solutions that benefit all of us,” Bosn said during debate on LB 513 earlier this month.
‘More robust process’
Tim Hruza, on behalf of the Nebraska State Bar Association, citing a State Bar Association study in 2022, told the Appropriations Committee in March that an average partner at a law firm makes about $250,000 for the experience he said one would hope to see in judicial applicants.
“We have great judges. We have quality candidates coming through,” Hruza told the Appropriations Committee. “We want to see a more robust process where [more] people are applying for these and that we’re getting great candidates.”

Nebraska Supreme Court Chief Justice Jeffrey Funke, who previously served as a county and district judge, told lawmakers this year that “very rarely” will private attorneys apply because it is more “financially lucrative” to remain a private attorney. He said LB 513 could help attract and retain good lawyers for the Nebraska judiciary.
Nebraska judges are retained every six years by a vote of the people divided in distinct judicial districts. Since the system was implemented in 1962, eight judges have been removed, including one justice. The last judge removed was in 2008. This means that, barring the very rare power of impeachment, judicial appointments can largely be for life, or until retirement.
Hruza and Funke were among a handful of supporters of the original LB 513 seeking 4% raises each of the next two years before it was pared back in April to annual 1.5% increases.
In 2023, lawmakers approved salary bumps of 6% on July 1, 2023, and 7% on July 1, 2024. Those raises brought Nebraska Supreme Court justices and judges on the Nebraska Court of Appeals above $200,000 in 2023, a feat that the remaining 135 judges surpassed in 2024.
Other investments?
While the consecutive pay bumps are noteworthy on their own, LB 513 is making waves by generating some of the most pushback similar bills have gotten in more than a decade. It’s common for one or two senators to oppose the raises, but six senators opposed the salary increase in 2013, in a 41-6 vote. No senators voted against the 2023 raises, passing 40-0.
State Sens. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha, Danielle Conrad of Lincoln, Terrell McKinney of Omaha and Ashlei Spivey of Omaha are among those who argue that, given the state’s structural budget concerns, judicial pay raises aren’t a top priority.
“I think it sends the wrong message to use taxpayer dollars to have more significant raises for judges, who are fair-minded and work hard, but who are already making more than their peers in many instances,” Conrad, a civil rights attorney, said earlier this month.
  State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln speaks at a news conference related to reviewing state rules and regulations. Jan. 16, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Conrad noted that Nebraska judges’ salaries are in the top 20 nationwide, and district judges are in the top 10. Funke shared those figures himself when he supported LB 513.
A spokesperson for Gov. Jim Pillen also noted the national rankings. Under questioning from Conrad, Bosn said she anticipates the governor would sign the pared-back version of LB 513. Pillen’s office has declined to say publicly whether Pillen would sign or veto LB 513.
Passing LB 513 would follow Pillen’s intended line-item veto of $12 million to the judicial branch. The vetoes are being ignored after legislative leaders last week said Pillen’s office may have run afoul of the Nebraska Constitution and not have properly delivered the line-item vetoed bills in time to the Legislature. The matter could come under scrutiny in Nebraska courts.
“Every branch of government must contribute to balancing our state budget,” Pillen said last week in announcing his targeted budget vetoes.
‘Just not the right time’
Of LB 513, McKinney said he had a hard time justifying the increases while other court services, such as juvenile probation, were at risk without more funding.
  State Sen.-elect Ashlei Spivey of Omaha talks with State Sen. Rick Holdcroft of Bellevue at a legislative retreat in Kearney on Thursday, Dec. 12, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Spivey said some state agencies under the governor have struggled to attract talent and while some requested budget increases to try to do so, the Appropriations Committee didn’t fulfill every request. Similar to McKinney, she said it would be wiser to prioritize and invest in actual court services at this time.
“It doesn’t mean that the judges are not important or that we can’t look at competitive salaries,” Spivey said. “It’s just not the right time.”
Cavanaugh, who serves on the budget-writing Appropriations Committee with Spivey, said it was maybe the year to “hit pause” amid the consecutive increases.
“We got to tighten our belts and suspenders or whatever article of clothing you want to quote,” Cavanaugh said during debate.
‘Reasonable request’
State Sen. Bob Hallstrom of Syracuse, an attorney, defended the increases. He said it’s sometimes overlooked how much time judges put in, often away from their courthouses, “pouring” over court files and weighing decisions that they know will affect peoples’ lives.
State Sen. Rob Clements of Elmwood, chair of the Appropriations Committee, also supported the pared-back pay increases as a “reasonable request.”

As lawmakers worked toward a balanced budget for the next two years, Clements sought to leave enough wiggle room with LB 513 in mind. He also helped protect salary and health insurance increases for other state employees across the three branches of government. Clements has said he expects LB 513 will pass.
Hallstrom, a freshman member of the Judiciary Committee, also cited those pay raises, up to 3.5% in some cases, as a reason LB 513 is needed.
“If it was my preference, I would prefer to treat judges in the same fashion,” Hallstrom said.
A need for ‘good judges’
The increases to judges’ salaries are considered annual appropriations bills, but unlike the mainline bills that the Appropriations Committee considers, the Judiciary Committee chair routinely introduces pay increases to be considered by their committee. That’s a process left in place from the days of former State Sen. Ernie Chambers of Omaha.

State law requires that the governor have at least two candidates to choose from when filling a judicial vacancy. However, Funke and Bosn noted that sometimes there are only two qualified lawyers. In those cases, if one candidate is not forwarded on, the search process restarts.
Such a scenario happened around the Norfolk area in March for a district court judge who retired in January. Pillen named a successor May 14 after the delay.
Other government officials’ pay
Retired Lancaster County District Judge Rob Otte, past chair of the Nebraska State Bar Association’s House of Delegates and current president of the Nebraska Lawyers Foundation, told the Judiciary Committee in February he took a pay cut when he became a judge.
Otte, who retired in 2022, said he thought a robust crop of candidates would vie for his seat. However, only three applicants came and none from private practice.
“Despite my personal calls and having coffee and lunch with more than two dozen private practicing lawyers, I could get not one to put their name in the hat to be a district court judge,” Otte said.



Otte said he often hears that judges’ salaries should be compared to other government employees. He said that while he tends to agree, senators should “decouple” that thinking and look at what’s best for judges.
“You want the best, not the cheapest,” Otte said in February.
‘No better investment’
Lancaster County Judge Holly Parsley, president of the Nebraska County Judges Association, said county judges review arrest and search warrants at any time of the day and must handle the “awesome responsibilities” of the position they have been entrusted with.
She looked to the guidance of former U.S. Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer that “the integrity, wisdom and independence of judges are the cornerstones of a just society.”
“Without good judges, the rule of law is but an empty promise,” Parsley said.
In a similar vein, Funke said, “judges solve legal problems and disputes, both large and small, and do so with patience and grace.”
“Every case is important to someone, and every case is important to our judges,” he testified in February. “There is no better investment you can make in the future of state government than investing in competitive salaries for the judiciary.”

(Photo: John Partipilo)Modeling for infectious disease research, vaccine education programs, a rural mental health program, disinformation research and a project developing evacuation route technology for active shooter scenarios are among the federally funded grants at Tennessee universities terminated by the Trump administration.
The University of Tennessee system reported losing $37.7 million in funding for 42 grants earlier this month, the majority of which came from grants for the UT Institute of Agriculture. Six grants remain “pending.” 
Nine partial stop work orders are in effect, preventing portions of projects from being completed but not impacting the total award, according to University of Tennessee spokesperson Melissa Tindell. The university released a full list of its federal grants on Wednesday.
Middle Tennessee State University reported losing roughly $640,000 due to 10 grant terminations, encompassing grants from the National Science Foundation, the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Institute of Museum and Library Sciences and the Tennessee Department of Health.
Vanderbilt University, Tennessee State University, East Tennessee State University and the University of Memphis did not respond to requests for a list of terminated grants. Records maintained by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) list millions more in grant cuts at those schools, but data posted to the DOGE website is imperfect. 
UT system loses $37.7M in federal grants; Institute of Agriculture is hardest hit

For example, DOGE’s website lists only one terminated grant at MTSU: a roughly $305,000 National Science Foundation grant for the development of a “Framework for Integrating Technology for Equity.” While this is among MTSU’s terminated grants, several others are not listed in DOGE’s data, including a program that supported students with disabilities in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM), archeological research at Fort Negley and research on COVID-19 health disparities.
One of the grant recipients — The Alliance of Students with Disabilities for Inclusion, Networking, and Transition Opportunities in STEM – stated on its website that its NSF funding terminated on May 2, “due to the alignment of our work with the agency’s evolving priorities.”
“This decision does not reflect the quality or importance of the work we’ve done together — work that has empowered students with disabilities and advanced equity in STEM across the country,” the website states.
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the selection process for terminated grants. 
Broadly, President Donald Trump’s executive orders have included orders to terminate “‘diversity, equity, and inclusion’ discrimination in the federal workforce, and in federal contracting and spending.” Trump’s administration has also taken aim at Biden-era climate policies. 
Of the 42 grants terminated across the University of Tennessee system, nearly 40% referenced diversity, inclusion, minorities, race, underserved or marginalized groups, sexuality or gender in their titles. Five terminated grants mentioned infectious disease or immunization in their titles, and COVID-19 disparities or prevention efforts were specifically mentioned in three.
Impact not limited to college campuses
Cuts to collegiate research can have impacts far beyond their fields. 
Most basic, foundational research is done in the academic sphere, according to Alexandra Graddy-Reed, an associate professor at the University of Southern California’s Sol Price School of Public Policy. It’s more difficult to tell if this type of research will be profitable, so about 60% of this type of research is funded by the federal government rather than industries or nonprofits, she said.
“Without the federal government funding academic research, it would drastically decrease what we can accomplish,” Graddy-Reed said.
A portion of the University of Tennessee’s terminated grants deal with COVID-19 disparities. Graddy-Reed used this as an example of potential long-term implications.
“If you look at COVID in particular, Vanderbilt was one of the first organizations leading to a vaccine through their research, but that research wasn’t just started in 2020, right?” she said. It was decades in the making.
“When you stop that basic research, when you stop understanding how pandemics spread, how they impact our populations, when the next pandemic hits, we are not as prepared to address the issue,” Graddy-Reed said.

Terrell Morton, an assistant professor of identity and justice in STEM education at the University of Illinois Chicago’s School of Education, had similar concerns.
“One of the things that people talk about is this concept of brain drain, or the idea that as a country, we’re going to lose a lot of the rich innovation, because colleges and universities are sort of the main driving sites for research-based innovation,” Morton said.
Researchers at MTSU and University of Tennessee declined interviews.
Regarding the termination of multiple grants that included a focus on minorities, Morton said science has shown that “the experiences, the needs and the outcomes of people differ based off of not only things like their race, but also their gender, their socioeconomic status, whether or not they live in an urban or rural or suburban neighborhood.”
Morton highlighted the National Science Foundation’s authority to engage in “broader impacts work,” which can include increasing participation of women, people with disabilities and underrepresented minorities in STEM, according to NSF’s website. Morton said that also includes veterans and people from rural communities.
“If you remove federal funding from grants that explore things like the implications of rurality on mental health, then there’s not going to be any knowledge or resources generated to help people in rural spaces that don’t have access to high-quality health care or don’t have access to high-quality mental health services,” he said.
Further implications stretch to the economy — less funding means less support for graduate students, research technicians, and publication editors. Less funding also means fewer researchers attending professional conferences, booking hotels and meeting space and supporting the service industry in conference locations, Morton said.

Graddy-Reed said less research funding can erode an institution’s ability to provide the infrastructure and equipment needed to do research.
“Science is America’s competitive advantage, and we rely heavily on government funding for that,” she said. “If that gets cut, we’re in decline as a society, but so is our competitive advantage in the global economy.”
While grant funding cuts were catalyzed by politics, Morton said these cuts impact everyone, regardless of their political affiliation. He said he’s hopeful that people will see the results not from a political perspective but from a practical one: what benefits the nation and its communities.
“In my opinion, what truly benefits our nation and our communities are research and scientific explorations that can help develop new innovations and outcomes that elevate the life, the liberty, and the pursuit of happiness of our people,” he said.

They also play music to “drown out the harassment and create a calmer atmosphere,” Pueblo ProChoice President Jacquelyn Bernal said. 
If those deescalation tactics don’t work and situations escalate beyond what her organization can control, they contact law enforcement, Bernal said. 
“Our first priority is getting the patient inside safely so they can make it to their appointment without interference,” Bernal said in a statement. “The bubble law is part of Colorado’s criminal code, and it’s there to protect patients and providers. We just need it to be enforced.”

Colorado’s “bubble law” prohibits anyone from approaching people within 100 feet of a health care facility, including abortion clinics. It was crafted to curb the practice of protesters trying to dissuade patients from seeking abortions.
Most Colorado abortion providers who participated in research by the National Abortion Federation said they experienced trespassing and protests outside their clinics in 2023 and 2024, according to a recent report.
Of the 17 Colorado abortion providers that participated, 65% experienced at least one incident of trespassing, 53% reported protestors outside, 24% experienced an incident of obstruction, and 18% received threats.
A spokesperson for the National Abortion Federation said Colorado providers received 216 suspicious, harassing or threatening calls, mail, emails or social media posts, compared with 150 in the previous report covering 2020-2022. A similar number of providers participated in the both reports but not the exact same group. 
Providers reported 27 instances of trespassing in the most recent report compared with 17 in the previous, 10 instances of vandalism compared with eight, eight instances of obstruction compared with seven, and five threats of death or harm compared with three. 
Bernal said while Colorado’s bubble law exists to prevent “exactly this kind of intimidation,” law enforcement needs to better enforce it. 
“Law enforcement must do their part to protect patients,” Bernal said. “When federal protections fall short, it’s up to our communities and our state to step up. We need to protect each other and uphold the right to seek health care safely.”
Providers in Colorado have consistently seen higher numbers of people seeking abortion care and have adapted to meet the new demand after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. Every state except New Mexico that borders Colorado has some abortion restrictions. Nearby Texas does, too.
About 62% of Colorado voters in November approved Amendment 79, which enshrined access to abortion as a right in the Colorado Constitution. The Colorado Legislature approved a measure implementing the amendment, and also passed several shield laws to protect providers and out-of-state patients. 
Christie Burkhardt, director of facilities and infrastructure operations at the Boulder Valley Health Center, joined the center’s team shortly after the 2022 Supreme Court decision upending national abortion rights to help with the uptick in demand and oversee security. 
Between Burkhardt’s start with the center in July 2022 and October 2024, she said she only reached out to local law enforcement over disruptions twice. Since October 2024, as the presidential election approached and rhetoric on abortion rights grew, she has called law enforcement 17 times for assistance with disruptions at the clinic. She said she has gotten to know the local police department “very well” in the last six months.
The center, which offers the full spectrum of reproductive health care, sees protesters at the public sidewalk next to its parking lot two to three times per week as of fall 2024, Burkhardt said. Small groups of people will try to talk to patients and clinic staff for anywhere from half an hour to full days, she said. Burkhardt said protesters are “very emboldened” after the Trump administration pardoned protesters convicted under the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act and halted its enforcement. 
“That can get very frightening for folks that have never been approached and have never had to deal with someone protesting what they do and at their work place, so our team has definitely had to learn a little bit on the fly,” Burkhardt said. 
She said harassing and threatening phone calls also increased at the center, particularly after the Boulder Abortion Clinic — one of the few clinics in the country that offered late-term abortions — shut its doors at the end of April. The center also receives about 10-15 pieces of threatening mail a month.
Staff canceled a sex ed summer camp planned for 5th grade to 8th grade students out of safety concerns after the center garnered national attention online from right-wing media and other abortion opponents. Burkhardt said she has weekly conversations with clinic staff about safety, and they’ve developed new policies to ensure the safety of staff and patients. 
Karen Middleton, president of Cobalt, which advocates for access to reproductive health care and runs an abortion fund in Colorado, said her organization remains in contact with its partner clinics to gather feedback on their concerns and needs around clinic safety.
“Reports like these really emphasize why states like Colorado must take action on their own to ensure patients and providers are protected now that federal protection is not guaranteed,” Middleton said in a statement. 
Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains, which operates about a dozen clinics across the state, declined to comment for this article.

Like many moderate-income workers, public school teachers Julia and Scott Whitnall didn’t think they’d become homeowners in their early 30s. Especially in California.
“We never felt homeownership was in our cards. But we did it!” Julia Whitnall said. “We’re extremely happy.”
The couple moved May 16 to a $509,000 two-bedroom house in Ripon, east of San Francisco in the Central Valley region.
It wasn’t easy. Despite a relatively high combined income of $140,000 from their nearby jobs, they had to compromise on size and take on extra work at summer camps to pull it off. Then they had to exercise patience as the sellers struggled to find a new home.
High interest rates and high prices in a still-competitive housing market continue to make it tough for first-time buyers, even those with good but moderate incomes.
On a national level, households making $75,000 to $100,000 — typical of teachers, nurses and skilled trades workers in many states — face a daunting lack of homes they can afford. That’s according to new research by the National Association of Realtors and Realtor.com based on listings in March of this year compared with 2024. However, the numbers showed an encouraging 20% increase in homes for sale, affordable or not.
Despite more houses for sale, those moderate-income buyers — which the report called “middle- and upper-middle-income buyers” — are much more hard-pressed to find an affordable home than they were in 2019, when almost half the homes on the market were affordable to them. This year they can afford only 21.2% of homes on the market — a slight improvement compared with 20.8% in 2024, according to the report.
It also found that a few states are improving in affordability for people in the $75,000-to-$100,000 income range. But many states are not.
The largest affordability gaps are in California, Hawaii, Idaho, Massachusetts and Montana, where such households can afford fewer than 12% of houses on the market. By contrast, they could afford about half the houses for sale in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Ohio and West Virginia.
There’s progress in states that are adding more housing at moderate price points: Arizona, Colorado, Delaware, Florida and Utah, according to the Realtors report.
Nationwide, to get home markets back in line with moderate-income families, the United States needs 416,000 more homes for sale at or below $255,000, according to the report.
“In many places, we’re still seeing a huge mismatch between income levels and what’s available to buy for moderate-income families,” said Nadia Evangelou, the National Association of Realtors’ senior economist and director of real estate research.
“We are no longer in crisis mode, but we are still very far from where we need to be. We can’t fix it overnight. It will take years,” Evangelou said.

Heather, who asked not to share her last name for privacy reasons, said she can’t even think of buying a house near her job on Long Island, New York. She makes more than $100,000 as a registered nurse and her family makes $170,000 with her husband’s job in building maintenance. But $4,400 in rent and $2,000 in monthly day care costs for three children have them living paycheck to paycheck.
“We can’t even afford a small car repair, let alone a mortgage in our hometown” of Ronkonkoma in Suffolk County, Heather said. Their jobs exposed her and her husband to risks in the pandemic that her neighbors avoided with remote work, she said. But she now feels like she’s in worse shape financially than she was in 2019 and considers moving away.
“All of our hard work feels like it was for nothing,” Heather said. “It’s disheartening that we can’t afford to live where we grew up, but that’s the reality we are facing.”
Some states can still be a refuge of affordability.
Ashley and Tristan Jonas bought a $252,000 house in northwest Ohio after three years of getting shut out by higher or all-cash offers. Ashley Jonas, 32, trained as a teacher but now works in skilled trades as a project coordinator for a countertop company, and the couple makes about $140,000 with Tristan Jonas’ job as a computer programmer.
“We happened to hit the market at the right time in 2025,” Ashley Jonas said. “We bid on this house just as [President Donald] Trump was announcing tariffs. I think a lot of people were holding their coin purses. We weren’t.”
Help for teachers
Teachers, who generally make less than nurses or trades workers, are particularly squeezed. Some states, facing teacher shortages in local schools, are working to raise pay. And increasingly, some schools and hospitals are providing housing to lure more teachers and nurses.
“We lose so many teachers because they can’t find housing here,” said Autumn Rivera, a 20-year teaching veteran and 2022 Colorado Teacher of the Year. Despite her experience and credentials, Rivera said she can’t contemplate buying even a townhouse in the rural resort town of Glenwood Springs, where she teaches.
Prices for those townhouses now start in the $700,000 range, more than twice what they were when she last considered buying in 2019. Rivera feels lucky to have a reasonable rent by sharing a home with its owner, but many teachers in her Roaring Fork Schools need the 117 apartments provided by the district with affordable rent, she said. The district hopes the apartments will allow teachers to save up for a home; it has also built 14 houses for staff with Habitat for Humanity and Holy Cross Energy.
One way to make homebuying more feasible for teachers is to pay them more — a strategy that paid off for New Mexico, one of the few bright spots in a different report on teachers’ inability to afford housing, which was published this month by the National Council on Teacher Quality, a research and advocacy group.
Beginning teachers in Albuquerque saw a 60% increase in pay between 2019 and 2025, which fell just short of a 65% jump in home prices, according to the report. The report credited a state law that raised teacher salaries, including starting pay, by $10,000.
“We’re dealing with the issue of teachers being able to live in the communities where they’re actually working,” said state Rep. Joy Garratt, a Democrat who sponsored a new law, signed in April, that sets higher minimum salaries for teachers effective July 1.
Detroit schools also gave teachers with advanced degrees a pay boost of up to 50% since 2019, about the same increase as home prices, according to the report from the National Council on Teacher Quality. Albuquerque and Detroit are on the report’s list of most affordable places for beginning teachers to live.
But nationally, on average, experienced teachers who started in 2019 are less able to afford a home now than when they began, according to the report.
“Teacher pay has gone up 24% in the last five years, which some might say is solid growth, and yet the increase in house for purchase has gone up 47%,” said Heather Peske, the organization’s president.
“Housing prices are critical to being able to attract and keep great teachers,” Peske said. “People will be leaving the profession trying to find something that pays enough for housing. And bottom line, kids won’t get as good an education.”

Murphy Smith says he was unemployed for four years because of medical issues before becoming a rideshare driver in Eugene, Oregon.
Driving allows him to work without triggering his severe asthma, Smith, 47, says. But without a set minimum wage, he says he works 12 to 16 hours a day to support himself.
Smith, who’s part of the rideshare drivers advocacy group Drivers Union Oregon, hopes pending legislation will help bring drivers like him a livable wage.
“There are a lot of people here in the Eugene area that don’t own a car, and once the buses or the public transportation shuts down, we’re who they call,” Smith said. “So we are an essential part of the workforce here.”
Advocates across several states say they’ve increased their activism recently because Uber and Lyft are pushing back harder than ever, as more cities and states pass laws requiring minimum pay and benefit requirements.

The rideshare industry is not as heavily regulated as independent taxi drivers or taxi companies, which are subject to rules on permitting, background checks, vehicle inspections and more, depending on the state or locality.
Rideshare drivers and labor advocates across the country are urging state and local leaders to require rideshare companies to provide benefits for drivers, including paid sick leave, minimum wages and workers’ compensation.
The companies have argued that establishing minimum wages for rideshare drivers would raise the price of rides for customers. Uber and Lyft are working to prevent some states from passing rideshare legislation through public campaigns and lobbying.
Oregon Democratic state Sen. Kayse Jama, who sponsored the bill pending in his state, said drivers told him last summer that their accounts were being deactivated without notice. Even drivers who were highly rated were locked out of their accounts, unable to earn any money, he said.
“A lot of those folks are mainly immigrants and refugees, so they don’t drive Uber as a side hustle or side gig,” Jama said. “This is their livelihood. This is how they feed their families. So, they brought the issue to my attention.”
Their stories inspired Jama to introduce legislation that would set a minimum wage for Oregon drivers, require a “just cause” for deactivation — or “lockouts” — of driver accounts, establish sick leave accrual, increase fare transparency, and create a new driver resource center. Neighboring Washington has a similar model, which was enacted in 2022.
Uber has opposed the Oregon bill, saying that the company needs more time to work with the state on drafting the measure. Uber spokesperson Zahid Arab, testifying against the bill, said the legislation would make rideshare “dramatically more expensive for Oregon riders, reduce access to affordable transportation options, and lead to fewer flexible earning opportunities for drivers.”










A lot of those folks are mainly immigrants and refugees, so they don't drive Uber as a side hustle or side gig. This is their livelihood. This is how they feed their families.


– Oregon Democratic state Sen. Kayse Jama


Jama said that he and his team have been negotiating with Uber and Lyft since the beginning of the legislative session, but there’s more work to do.
“At the end of the day, we want a bill that’s equitable to both the parties but also ensures that the drivers are getting the relief that they desperately need,” Jama said.
Lockouts are not exclusive to drivers in Oregon. Drivers in New York City first reported last summer periods of time when they could not access Uber or Lyft. The companies were limiting the number of active drivers in response to the city’s minimum wage rules.
Uber came to an agreement with New York City last July to reduce the lockouts, but drivers using Lyft were still seeing account deactivations months later.
Uber and Lyft did not respond to Stateline requests for comment.
 New laws proliferate

Generally, rideshare drivers are paid a base fare for each trip, with additional money for the time and distance traveled. In some cities, drivers can also see the amount of money they’ll earn before accepting a ride. Passengers can choose to tip drivers, too.
But every location has different rates. For instance, the minimum pay rates for drivers in Washington state have increased to $1.34 per mile and $0.39 per minute, with a trip minimum of $3.45 per trip, according to the state’s labor department. In Seattle, the pay rates are even higher.
Colorado Senate approves ride-sharing safety bill with substantial amendments

In places without set rules, drivers are subject to rates that depend on the location and availability of rides. These earnings are reduced by driver expenses, including gas, car maintenance and more.
In 2019, the nation’s first minimum wage pay rate for rideshare drivers went into effect in New York City. The minimum pay rates for time and mileage amount to drivers earning $17.22 an hour after expenses. It was a significant win for advocates in the city who had campaigned for better pay for years. New York later established minimum pay rates for drivers across the state.
Seattle in 2020 became the second city to require minimum wages for rideshare drivers.
In 2023, Minneapolis city leaders were also considering an ordinance that would increase driver pay, but Uber and Lyft threatened to leave the city entirely if it were to pass.
As part of a 2024 statewide deal after a long battle between Minnesota lawmakers and the rideshare companies, the pay rates for drivers rose to $1.28 per mile and 31 cents per minute on average for time spent driving passengers. As part of the deal, cities were banned from passing their own regulations on wages.
California, Massachusetts and Washington also have passed legislation to set minimum wages and rates for rideshare drivers over the past five years.
Massachusetts reached an agreement with Uber last year that guaranteed minimum earnings of $32.50 per hour to start, a portable health insurance benefit fund established last month and multilingual chat support coming later this year.
Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York and Washington also require rideshare companies to give drivers paid sick leave, workers’ compensation, paid family and medical leave, and other benefits.
In contrast, a California appeals court ruled in 2023 that transportation network companies could treat drivers as independent contractors, meaning they are not entitled to benefits in the state. The ruling upheld a voter-approved law.
Lawmakers in Connecticut and Wisconsin introduced legislation this year that would give rideshare drivers better pay transparency, as well as accident and sickness insurance coverage.
Earlier this year, Uber also sued Colorado over a law, Senate Bill 24-75, that requires the company to provide pay disclosures for drivers, arguing that the law violates Uber’s free speech rights. The law requires transportation network companies to disclose to drivers the total amount a passenger paid for a trip, how much is given to the driver and how much the passenger tipped.
 Washington state compromises

For more than eight years, Ahmed Mahamud has been driving for Uber and Lyft to support his family in Seattle.
Driving for the rideshare companies is his full-time job, he said, and business in Seattle is good.
“I love it,” said Mahamud, 51. “You’re helping people when they have a need. So, this isn’t just a job. It’s a ‘win-win’ job. You’re helping your community, and at the same time you are paying the bills.”
But he lacks the same benefits as a salaried job. So he joined Drivers Union and is pushing for better pay, benefits and protections for drivers.
“We are not yet finished fighting against these companies because there are still things missing,” he said. “So, every single day, we are still fighting.”
In the absence of state and federal regulations, rideshare companies have too much power over the drivers they employ, said Drivers Union spokesperson Anna Minard. Drivers in Washington began to organize when they realized Uber and Lyft were changing how much money drivers would earn without letting them know, she said.
“To drivers, this seemed like an avenue for a lot of exploitation,” Minard said. “So, drivers organized from the get-go and tried various ways to get some rights enshrined in the law [in Washington]. Even though it’s contract work, people felt like they should be able to join together and fight for better pay and benefits and safety.”
In 2023, a year after rideshare drivers won minimum wage and other benefits, Washington lawmakers passed legislation that made it the first state to give drivers paid family and medical leave. Uber and Lyft supported the new benefits.
“These coordinated pieces of legislation reflect a true compromise between state lawmakers, labor leaders and transportation network companies to afford drivers historic new benefits while protecting the independence and flexibility they say they want,” an Uber spokesperson said in a statement to GeekWire at the time.
And last year, after Massachusetts drivers won new benefits that are rolling out over 2025, Tony West, Uber’s chief legal officer, said in a statement, “We hope to engage other policymakers, drivers, advocates and stakeholders around the world to forge similar solutions.”
Advocates with Drivers Union helped pass a law this year in Washington that requires rideshare companies to be more transparent about which cars are eligible for special ride options, which are offered to passengers for higher fees.
In addition to the standard UberX ride, the app offers UberXL for larger groups, Uber Comfort for newer cars with extra legroom and other options that generally cost more.
The legislation, which was signed into law by Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson earlier this month, came after hundreds of drivers saw advertisements from Uber telling them to buy more expensive cars to get more pay on rides, Mahamud said. But in a year, many of those cars would become ineligible once newer cars are introduced to the market, leaving drivers with expensive car notes without the benefit of higher rates to cover it.
“The drivers really came together and said, ‘This is just unfair,’” Mahamud said. “Yesterday we’re told to buy these cars, and then before we can pay the car off, we’re taken out of the product class which was supposed to pay for it.”
The law also requires rideshare companies to provide drivers with a record of their trip receipts.
Drivers and advocates are going to keep fighting for their rights, said Nicole Moore, the president of Rideshare Drivers United, a driver-run organization of more than 20,000 drivers in California. Moore is a part-time driver in the Los Angeles area, and she usually works Fridays and Saturdays.
“They (rideshare companies) think that to be an employee in America means you have to work full time, and it has to be a scheduled five-day workweek,” Moore said. “Now, we as Americans have all these misconceptions about what employment rights and labor rights could actually mean for everyone.”

(Getty Images) Ever since the Statue of Liberty raised her torch in New York Harbor, America has welcomed the “homeless, tempest-tossed” masses from foreign shores. Those seeking safety and opportunity in the United States have played a central role in making this country the leading world power it has been and the moral beacon it was. Unfortunately, our current government has decided to turn the page by pulling up the welcome mat and relinquishing its role as moral leader of the planet.
Just after being sworn in, Trump signed an executive order suspending refugee resettlement in the United States, which threw refugees waiting at foreign airports into limbo. He also suspended America’s asylum system, causing chaos amongst asylum seekers who faced danger in their home countries. Both programs were highly regarded around the world, reflecting great credit upon America. Now, both suspensions are being challenged in court actions.
They had tickets. A flight number. An arrival time. Then Trump’s executive order changed everything.

In just over a hundred days in office, Donald Trump has empowered a substantial army of federal agents to track down and speedily deport any foreign-looking U.S. residents. Most Americans support the removal of dangerous foreigners, so long as they receive a fair hearing. But most of us believe it is counterproductive to toss out farm, construction and home care workers who are long-time residents that abide by the law and contribute to society.
Trump announced in February that Temporary Protected Status would soon be revoked for about 530,000 Cubans, Nicaraguans, Venezuelans and Haitians. That means they would no longer be able to legally work in the U.S. and could be deported. Foreigners can be legally admitted with Temporary Protected Status when their home country suffers natural disaster or political upheaval. 
Trump has never been too keen on Haitians. During his first term he famously questioned why we should allow people from Haiti and African “sh_hole countries” to come to America. Presumably, his revocation of Temporary Protected Status would include the Haitians in Springfield, Ohio, who he falsely accused of eating the town’s cats and dogs. The Haitians were merely doing tough jobs that locals refused to do. Thankfully, a federal judge temporarily blocked the revocation order on April 14. 
Inexplicably, Trump announced the cancellation of Temporary Protected Statys for about 11,700 Afghans in the country, effective July 12. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem made the ludicrous claim that, “Afghanistan has had an improved security situation, and its stabilizing economy no longer prevent them from returning to their home country.” 
However, a military veteran who heads an organization dedicated to saving the lives of Afghans who put their necks on the line to help and protect American troops, gave the Military Times an informed assessment: “Afghanistan remains under the control of the Taliban. There is no functioning asylum system. There are still assassinations, arbitrary arrests, and ongoing human rights abuses, especially against women and ethnic minorities.” We owe those folks big time, and the administration should be ashamed for trying to send them back to almost certain death.
Rather than throwing our Afghan partners to the wolves, America should be using its best efforts to bring many more of those good friends to safety in the United States. We could take a page from the book of Idaho’s former Gov. and Sen. Dirk Kempthorne. He teamed up with two Army officers and a young Afghan American, Nawid Mousa, to raise $1 million to rescue 395 Afghan helpers and their families from Taliban clutches in 2021. 
Special treatment for some: Most refugee families in Idaho wait years to reunite with loved ones

What kind of nation could live with the infamy of abandoning its allies to the savage retribution of an enemy? Of all people, Trump should be helping these beleaguered Afghans, because his so-called peacemaking effort contributed greatly to the Taliban victory. By excluding the Afghan government from the negotiations and giving a definite U.S. withdrawal date, while obtaining no enforceable commitments from the Taliban, Trump created the problem that caused these helpers to have to flee their country.
Despite all of Trump’s efforts to prevent refugees, asylees and other immigrants from reaching America’s protective shores, Trump has bypassed all of the time-tested vetting procedures to grant unfettered entry to nearly 60 white South Africans. The decision was apparently made without the many months of vetting that previous refugees have had to undergo. Trump claimed these folks were fleeing genocide in their country but there is absolutely no credible evidence to support that claim.
Regardless of Trump’s reasons for greenlighting the South African “refugees,” Idaho’s nationally-recognized refugee settlement program will give those coming to Idaho a warm reception, as should we all. Two families with a total of 9 members are settling in Twin Falls. I wish them a warm welcome to the Gem State.

Gov. Kelly Armstrong signed bills that added age-verification requirements for websites publishing explicit content. He also signed a bill that added civil penalties for the creation and distribution of deepfake, or computer-generated, pornographic material without a subject’s consent. Both laws will go into effect Aug. 1.
 Age verification

Senate Bill 2380 and House Bill 1561 both will require age verification for websites containing a substantial portion of pornographic material that could be considered harmful to minors.
Rep. Steve Swiontek, R-Fargo, chief sponsor of House Bill 1561, said children are being exposed to pornography in significant numbers by age 12 and even more by age 17, which is one of the main reasons he sponsored the bill.
“The thought was there should be some requirement and expectations that these adult entertainment sites who are getting paid for this … that they should be mandated and required to verify age,” Swiontek said. “I think we have a moral obligation for these kids.”
Those websites under the new law would need to implement a verification system to confirm the user is over 18.
Swiontek said the age-verification bill was modeled after a similar bill was implemented in Utah in 2023. Critics of that bill pointed to ways it could be circumvented, The Associated Press reported.
Swiontek said there isn’t a “fool proof” way to stop minors from accessing pornographic websites.
States race to restrict deepfake porn as it becomes easier to create

“If we can prevent 90% of these things from happening, then it’s been a success,” Swiontek said. “And then, it can be tweaked two years from now as well.”
None of the information obtained while conducting age verification may be retained.
Websites that fail to comply with the age-verification requirements may be held liable for damages by a parent or guardian of a minor who accessed the explicit content or a person whose information was retained after the verification process.
The new law exempts internet service providers, search engines, cloud services and application stores from liability for facilitating connection between users and websites.
Cody Schuler, advocacy manager for the American Civil Liberties Union of North Dakota, said pornography is protected under the First Amendment. He added the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments over a similar age-verification law implemented in Texas and the court is expected to issue its decision in June or July.
“We are not opposed to protecting children,” Schuler said. “The concern becomes when … we put undue burden upon those individuals who are legal to access pornography.”
Schuler added that data collection by third-party age-verification hosts can also bring up potential privacy concerns.
“It is really important for us to hear what comes next from the Supreme Court and then look at where things go from there as far as what laws or corrections might need to be made,” he said.
 Deepfakes, computer-generated explicit images

House Bill 1351 makes it a misdemeanor to create, possess and distribute sexually expressive images, including real, altered or computer-generated deepfakes, that show nude or partially denuded figures without consent. 
The new law also provides an avenue for victims of those images to file civil lawsuits to recover up to $10,000 in statutory damages caused by the distribution. Plaintiffs would also be able to recover any money gained by a defendant through the distribution of the image.
Swiontek said he voted in support of the bill because it becomes difficult to get rid of manufactured, false content once it enters the internet.
“There has to be an obligation and a penalty for people who do that,” Swiontek said. 
U.S. House Republicans aim to ban state-level AI laws for 10 years

North Dakota lawmakers also passed Senate Concurrent Resolution 4017, which asks the Legislative Management Committee to consider studying the “detrimental impacts of pornography.” 
The goal of the study is to examine education, prevention and research of the societal consequences stemming from pornography. The resolution text alleges the porn industry “produces media that objectifies women and children, and depicts rape and abuse, perpetuating the demand for sex trafficking, prostitution, child pornography and sexual abuse images.”
The Legislative Management Committee received requests for 66 different studies to be completed during the interim, 19 of which are mandatory studies. Previously, John Bjornson, director of Legislative Council, said the committee could realistically complete about 45 studies during the 18-month interim.
The committee will meet for the first time during the interim Tuesday in Fargo.
President Donald Trump signed the Take It Down Act last week, which requires platforms to take down nonconsensual intimate depictions of individuals, real or deepfake images, within 48 hours of being notified or they may face criminal or civil penalties.

(John Sykes/Arkansas Advocate)On Wednesday Arkansas’ Oil and Gas Commission will for the third time in 18 months consider what lithium extractors should pay mineral rights holders in royalties.
On the agenda tomorrow is an application filed by SWA Lithium, a joint venture between Canada-based Standard Lithium and Norwegian energy giant Equinor, known for its Empire Wind offshore wind farm off the coast of New York.
Standard Lithium has already gone before the commission twice for a royalty determination — first in December 2023 and then again in November 2024. Both times, questions were raised as to whether Standard Lithium and its co-applicants — in 2023, Lanxess; in 2024, Lanxess, Albemarle, Tetra Tech and ExxonMobil-subsidiary Saltwerx — had provided enough data to justify the proposed royalty rates. 


Neither time resulted in a royalty being set.
The commission will have to decide if Standard Lithium’s new proposed 2.5% royalty rate and royalty structure are fair and equitable.
You can read more about the application itself here.
  What’s the deal with lithium, anyway? 

Multiple companies — from oil and gas behemoths like ExxonMobil, to major chemical companies like Lanxess and Albemarle, to relative-newcomers like Standard Lithium — are trying to get in on the valuable lithium reserves trapped in South Arkansas’ subterranean brine, thousands of feet below the earth.
Arkansas state officials have touted the economic benefits such industrial investments could bring to the state while passing legislation to incentivize it. 


  Who are the players in this lithium stuff? 


Standard Lithium: The Vancouver, B.C.-based company was one of the first movers on the lithium scene in Arkansas. It established a test plant in El Dorado in 2018 to test DLE processes using debrominated brine from the Lanxess South plant, which already draws up brine to extract bromine. The so-called Lanxess project hasn’t seen much movement, but Standard Lithium’s joint venture with Equinor, known as SWA Lithium or Smackover Lithium, is at the center of this third royalty application. Standard Lithium is also set to receive $225 million in federal funding from the U.S. Department of Energy to help fund the first phase of the SWA Project.
Equinor: A Norwegian energy company, already known in the U.S. for its Empire Wind project off the coast of New York. It bought a stake in the SWA Project last year.
Albemarle: A Fortune 500 chemical company that is already a major world player in the global lithium production industry. Its lithium evaporation ponds in Chile have garnered criticism for alleged impacts to water quality and the environment in the area. Currently, Albemarle operates bromine extraction plants in South Arkansas, around Magnolia. Last year the company sought and received permission from the AOGC to operate its own DLE test facility in South Arkansas. Albemarle was also a party to the royalty application that was heard in November. 
Lanxess: Formerly known as Great Lakes Chemical Company, and Chemtura before that, Lanxess operates three bromine production facilities in Union County. Standard Lithium’s test facility is located at the Lanxess South plant. Lanxess was party to both the 2023 and 2024 lithium royalty applications.
Tetra Technologies: A Texas-based company in the energy, chemical and critical minerals sectors. It has operated a plant in West Memphis to create bromine fluids for oil and gas wells since the 1990s. Tetra possesses the Evergreen Unit in South Arkansas, which it plans to develop for lithium extraction with Saltwerx.
Saltwerx: A subsidiary of oil and gas giant ExxonMobil, Saltwerx was party to the November application, and recently received AOGC approval for its Pine Unit, a crucial step to get a future royalty determination of its own after the commission ruled last year that having an established brine unit was a prerequisite for establishing a royalty. 
South Arkansas Minerals Association: Headed by Robert Reynolds — a former member of the state Pollution Control and Ecology Commission and one of the masterminds behind the initiative to replenish the Sparta Aquifer in Union County — the association represents the interests of South Arkansas mineral rights owners. SAMA objected to both previous royalty applications on a number of grounds, but has not formally objected to the Standard Lithium-Equinor royalty application.
Mineral Rights Owners: These people and companies own tracts of mineral rights — and no, that doesn’t mean that they own the land itself. Due to court rulings and property law, oftentimes the person or group that owns the mineral rights in a particular area is entirely different from the owner of the land. Under state law, if a substance, like lithium, is profitably extracted from the brine they own, then they are entitled to a royalty.
Arkansas Oil and Gas Commission: Both a regulatory agency and an adjudicatory body, the AOGC is charged with overseeing Arkansas’ oil and gas industry, along with certain other extractive industries that draw from underground resources. That includes lithium extraction from brine.



Albemarle, Lanxess and their predecessors have extracted this brine for decades, as bromine is also abundant in the fluid. Brine is also extracted as a byproduct of the region’s century-old oil and gas industry.
Companies have cited Arkansas’ extensive and unique regulatory structures as one of the points that makes the state attractive for developing a U.S. lithium industry. Now-retired AOGC director and current AOGC Commissioner Larry Bengal previously told the Advocate he believed Arkansas is the only state in the U.S. with a brine statute. 
A widely reported study from the U.S. Geological Survey last year estimated that the brines in the parts of the Smackover formation under South Arkansas held enough lithium to meet U.S. demand for decades. The study used machine learning to predict lithium quantities for the region using existing well data. However, one of the authors of the study told the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette that the report said nothing on whether that much lithium could feasibly be extracted from the formation, saying the study was meant to provide a birds-eye view of the potential of the region as a whole.
Geologists have known about the high lithium content of South Arkansas’ brine for decades, but until recently, the technology to extract it profitably wasn’t there. Companies said they’ve already spent millions in pursuit of lithium in the state, even though those companies haven’t yet given the final green light for large-scale extraction projects.
Standard Lithium and Equinor’s SWA Lithium project has already been awarded hundreds of millions in federal funding to build up a lithium extraction operation in South Arkansas as part of federal investments into critical minerals and other supply chains that have increasingly become concentrated in China. Lithium is a key component of rechargeable batteries, including those used in electric vehicles.
  That’s great and all, but how are they going to get lithium out of water? 

In short, it’s a process called “direct lithium extraction,” or DLE. It’s similar to the process used to treat hard water, just on a much larger scale. It hasn’t been used at commercial scale to extract lithium in the U.S. before, but some companies in China already use it. It’s different from other lithium mining methods, such as hard-rock mining and evaporation pond methods.
  Why does the royalty matter? 

There are a few reasons. The first is that none of the companies that have expressed interest in growing a lithium extraction industry in South Arkansas can actually begin extracting lithium from brine for profit before the AOGC approves a royalty. They have said previously that having a set royalty is crucial in order to know how much a full-scale extraction project will cost.
The royalty is required by the Arkansas Brine Conservation Act (ABCA), which first passed in the 1970s as a result of court cases that saw mineral rights owners demanding compensation from big chemical companies for diminishing the value of their owned mineral rights through the companies’ bromine operations, which would sometimes push spent brine towards their owned tracts and unextracted brine away from them. An amendment was added in the 1990s establishing the “other substances” provision, which sets the framework to determine royalties for substances extracted from brine other than bromine, such as lithium. 
The second reason is that some, like former AOGC commissioner Mike Davis, believe the only real economic benefit many ordinary Arkansans will get from lithium extraction will come from royalty payments. 
“When the drilling rigs are gone, when the completion process is complete, you’ve got two things left. You have the maintenance and you have the royalty income,” Davis said at the November hearing. “For the majority of the citizens and for the state of Arkansas itself, the real benefit to the mineral owners and royalty owners and citizens of the state of Arkansas will be the royalty that you gentlemen determine.”
  Other issues affecting the 2024 royalty decision

The commission agreed with the opinion of Administrative Law Judge Charles Moulton that a royalty could be applied only to existing brine units — geographic areas approved by the commission for mineral extraction. However, the November applicants wished to apply their proposed royalty to “existing units … and proposed future units” within certain counties — but only after amending their application. Originally, they asked for a royalty determination for the entire Smackover Formation within specific counties. 
Since then, both Standard Lithium and Saltwerx have applied for and received permission to create new brine units. You can read more about the brine units here.
  Why wasn’t a royalty determined in the last two hearings? 

The AOGC unanimously rejected the application it heard in November for a few reasons.
The state brine law says a royalty must be “fair and equitable,” and that a substance must be “profitably extracted” in order for a royalty to be paid. The commission must determine if a company’s proposed royalty meets that bar. 
One of the key hang-ups last year was that many people, the AOGC commissioners included, felt the royalty proposed by the so-called “Big 5” — Albemarle, Lanxess, Tetra Tech, Standard Lithium and Saltwerx — was not fair and equitable. The companies, for the most part, refused to provide any project data to justify the proposed royalty, citing antitrust concerns.
Multiple commissioners cited that refusal as the key reason they voted to reject the application in November, even as they said they believed the proposed royalty at the time, 1.82%, was not fair and equitable in the first place.
Similarly, the 2023 application filed by Standard Lithium and Lanxess ran into justification issues, with commissioners requesting the companies return with further documentation to support the proposal before they made a decision. Instead, the two companies withdrew the application and eventually signed onto the second application last summer.
  Are all of the same companies involved in the royalty the commission is hearing this week? 

No. Only Standard Lithium and Equinor, its partner in the SWA Project, are party to this royalty hearing. That means that if the commission decides to approve the proposed royalty, it would apply only to Standard Lithium’s and Equinor’s Reynolds Unit, which encompasses parts of Columbia, Lafayette and Miller Counties. It would not apply to Saltwerx’s Pine Unit, Tetra Tech’s Evergreen Unit, or any of Lanxess’ long-established brine units in Union County.
If the joint venture decides it wants to expand the royalty’s applicability to other units it establishes in the future, it would need to go back before the commission for another royalty determination.
  What else should we know about the November 2024 royalty hearing? 

The run-up to tomorrow’s hearing has been much quieter than last year’s hearing. Dozens of people objected to the 1.82% royalty proposed in the Big Five application last year. 
The South Arkansas Minerals Association, a group representing mineral-rights holders, objected to the first proposed royalty in December 2023, and their objection led to the hearing being delayed from September to November so that the administrative law judge could hold a hearing on certain legal matters. Moulton’s recommendations to the commission after that hearing were largely adopted and played a role in why the Big Five application was rejected.
As of Friday, only one person had filed an objection to the Standard Lithium-Equinor royalty application. Robert Reynolds, the president of SAMA, has not filed an objection, but told the Advocate he would be watching carefully to see if the applicants brought forward sufficient evidence to support their royalty proposal this time around. Until they did, he said, he had no way of knowing if 2.5% is “fair and equitable.”

(Office of the Attorney General J.B. McCuskey photo)Attorney General J.B. McCuskey didn’t join 40 other state attorneys general calling on Congress to reject what they call an “irresponsible” federal measure that would block states from setting their own regulations on the use of artificial intelligence for the next 10 years.
Right now, states have the authority to set their own AI rules. The West Virginia Legislature recently passed a bill prohibiting the creation, distribution or possession of AI-generated child pornography.
A letter from the National Association of Attorneys General issued earlier this month said the “broad” AI moratorium measure, which is tucked into President Donald Trump’s tax cut bill, would be “sweeping and wholly destructive of reasonable state efforts to prevent known harms associated with AI.” 
McCuskey’s office didn’t respond to questions about why he didn’t sign onto the letter, which included Republicans from Ohio, Tennessee and Virginia. 
“This bill does not propose any regulatory scheme to replace or supplement the laws enacted or currently under consideration by the states, leaving Americans entirely unprotected from the potential harms of AI,” the letter read. “Moreover, this bill purports to wipe away any state-level frameworks already in place. Imposing a broad moratorium on all state action while Congress fails to act in this area is irresponsible and deprives consumers of reasonable protections.”
According to an analysis by the National Conference of State Legislatures, 26 states adopted or enacted at least 75 new AI measures. Some of those measures have sought to ban the creation of deepfakes for political campaigns or ban the use of AI to send spam calls or texts. 
Republicans in Washington behind the proposed state-level ban say there’s an urgent need to pass a unified, federal set of guidelines after more than 1,000 pieces of legislation relating to AI have been introduced just this year. A 10-year moratorium on state’s enacting AI laws could give Congress the time to pass those guidelines, they say, and the language banning states from setting their own AI regulations was rolled into the 1,100 page controversial budget bill. 
  Sen. Ryan Weld, R-Brooke
Congress would prohibit enforcement of any existing laws on AI and decision-making systems. But Sen. Ryan Weld, R-Brooke, doesn’t think that West Virginia’s new law banning the use of AI in child pornography would be struck down should the federal measure pass because of how it’s written. 
The measure, Senate Bill 198, made it a felony offense in West Virginia to use or entice a minor to assist in creating computer-generated images for child pornography or create a visual portrayal of a minor engaging in any sexually explicit conduct. It also bans the distribution of AI-generated child pornography. Weld, an attorney, said it addressed a loophole in the state’s current laws prohibiting child pornography as AI is a growing industry. 
“The federal provisions would allow for SB 198 to go into effect because it doesn’t affect laws of general applicability …  because [the bill] affects AI, but also it doesn’t discriminate between using artificial intelligence to manipulate an image or create a visual portrayal of a minor … using Adobe Photoshop or something like that,” he explained.
Weld said he was “reluctant” about states potentially losing their ability to regulate AI.
“I don’t like to see states being able to legislate on their own in areas that they generally have the authority to,” he said. “States are the laboratories of democracy for a reason.”
There are limited AI laws in West Virginia, but lawmakers have begun introducing legislation on the topic and exploring how it might work in government. In 2023, the Legislature passed a bill that launched a pilot program to explore how AI could be used to assess road quality and predict maintenance projects. 
Last year the House of Delegates created the AI Select Committee that advanced four AI-related bills. Three of those measures died in the Senate, and one resolution, which created an AI Task Force, passed the full Legislature. The AI Task Force was asked to determine the state agency or agencies that would develop AI policies, consider public interest use cases for AI and more. The task force is supposed to submit a report by July. 
The National Conference of State Legislatures also opposes the proposed moratorium on states’ ability to regulate AI, saying in a letter to U.S. House members that it “is an infringement on states’ authority to effectively legislate in this rapidly evolving and consequential policy domain, and in our view, is a violation of the Byrd Rule.” The rule — named for late Democratic Senator Robert C. Byrd — governs the budget reconciliation process and provisions deemed “extraneous” are prohibited. 
The AI law moratorium measure was packaged with $500 million to modernize federal IT programs with commercial AI systems through 2035.
The U.S. House narrowly approved the GOP-backed massive tax and spending bill with the AI measure on Thursday. Both West Virginia Reps. Riley Moore and Carol Miller, R-W.Va., voted in support of the bill, and it now heads to the U.S. Senate.
In Washington D.C., a House subcommittee earlier this week took its first major step in discussing widespread regulations for AI legislation at the federal level. 
Support for federal guidelines or regulation around AI technologies received bipartisan support in the last Congress, States Newsroom reports. 
On May 22, McCuskey sent a letter on behalf of 15 attorneys general to the Department of Energy and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission outlining the need “for federal officials to establish a Strategic Electricity Reserve to protect our nation’s energy grid.” It would be used in cases of power shortages or emergencies.
In a news release, McCuskey said, “the reserve will provide a layer of security that is needed now more than ever.”

(Photo: John Partipilo)A Tennessee funeral director surrendered his license in 2020 after multiple complaints alleging he took money from immigrant families then failed to ship the remains of loved ones overseas for burial.
Now, new legal filings in an ongoing federal lawsuit show the state’s Department of Commerce and Insurance has received a “litany of complaints” against Reid Van Ness for failing to deliver on promised funeral services to Spanish-speaking residents of Tennessee and Kentucky in the years after losing his license. 
Van Ness, the subject of a 2021 Tennessee Lookout investigation, was among a small number of Spanish-speaking funeral directors in Tennessee who offered services to families seeking to ship bodies for burial overseas. 
A Tennessee funeral director made promises to immigrant families; he didn’t deliver

The Lookout investigation found that Van Ness had instead left multiple bodies to decay in coolers in Middle Tennessee funeral homes for periods that ranged between two to 11 months while family members frantically pressed him for information about their loved ones’ whereabouts. 
He falsified shipping documents, stopped answering families’ calls and left some families waiting for months to bury family members, state records showed. Among the grieving and distraught families were the parents of an 18-month old infant who died in a Nashville hospital and the mother of a 17-year-old boy who died by suicide.
At least five families filed suit against Van Ness and four funeral homes that agreed to store bodies for him. A state consumer alert issued in 2021 urged residents to report Van Ness to law enforcement after complaints he was approaching Spanish-speaking residents in Rutherford County to offer funeral services.
Murfreesboro mortuary settles suit in corpse “abuse” case

Van Ness is now fighting the state in federal court to be able to continue to provide volunteer funeral service, arguing he has a First Amendment right to serve as a “community death care advocate.” 
Van Ness claimed the state’s Board of Funeral Directors and Embalmers is illegally trying to restrict his freedom of religion by prohibiting him from participating in funeral services. He says he serves as a volunteer – a claim that is contrary to the complaints the board says it has received that Van Ness has accepted payment for his services. 
Van Ness “is part of a growing national movement rethinking the practices, customs, and approaches surrounding death,” the lawsuit said. 
“Mr. Van Ness shares his knowledge about end-of-life options with families to help them put their own end-of-life plan in place that is best for them and their loved ones. By engaging in these difficult but important conversation(s), he can give families the practical, emotional, and nontechnical support that funeral directors do not typically provide,” the lawsuit said. 
Lawsuits pile up against former funeral director

An attorney representing Van Ness could not be reached for comment about the lawsuit. A spokesperson for the Tennessee Department of Commerce and Insurance, which oversees the state’s funeral board, declined to comment on ongoing litigation.
In their legal response, the Department of Commerce and Insurance noted it had received complaints about Van Ness accepting payments for bungled funeral services between 2021 and 2023 after he had surrendered his license. 
In 2022, the state funeral board warned Van Ness he could not speak to consumers seeking funeral services, medical examiners, or undertake any actions relating to providing funeral, embalming or securing grave plots in Tennessee.
But throughout 2022 and 2023 the state’s funeral board “obtained evidence of various instances of Van Ness: accepting payment to arrange, manage, and perform funeral directing services; requesting to embalm and prepare loved ones of the deceased…and holding himself out as a licensed funeral director under another individual’s name.”
The lawsuit is scheduled for trial in June 2026.

(SPLC graphic)At least 13 organizations espousing hateful, extreme or antigovernment rhetoric were active in West Virginia in 2024, according to a report issued last week by the Southern Poverty Law Center.
Per the SPLC’s 2024 Year in Hate and Extremism report, eight of those groups were local while five were considered to be active statewide. The groups vary from neo-nazi and white supremacist groups to organizations that are generally anti-government and militias.
The SPLC is a nonprofit organization dedicated to protecting and advancing civil rights across the South and the wider United States. Since 2000, the organization has mapped and identified extremist groups across the country while researching how their ideologies can, and often do, influence policy making.
The groups identified as extremist by the SPLC that were active in West Virginia in 2024 are:

The Constitution Party of West Virginia, a far-right, small-government focused political party that in 2024 succeeded in getting a gubernatorial candidate, former state delegate S. Marshall Wilson, on the ballot for the general election
The Kanawha County chapter of Moms For Liberty, a local arm of the national nonprofit that gained attention by being at the forefront of book-banning movements. The group has advocated against education on systemic racism and has peddled anti-LGBTQ misinformation. Moms For Liberty has pushed back against being labeled an extremist hate group as classified by the SPLC
The National Constitutional Coalition of Patriotic Americans, an antigovernment group based in Bridgeport, per the SPLC. A Taylor County chapter of the organization is also listed among active extremist groups in West Virginia
The First West Virginia Volunteer Mountain Infantry, a militia based in Huntington
Folkish Active Clubs West Virginia, a neo-nazi organization considered to be active statewide
The Asatru Folk Assembly West Virginia, a statewide Neo-Volkisch organization that, per the SPLC, is characterized by “organized ethnocentricity and archaic notions of gender”
The Appalachia Active Club, a white nationalist organization considered to be active statewide
Full Haus, a white nationalist organization in Purgitsville. Per its website, supporters of Full Haus want a white ethnostate and traditional gender roles
Patriot Front, a white nationalist extremist group considered to be active across West Virginia. In 2024, dozens of members of Patriot Front — carrying fascistic symbols and face coverings to hide their identity — marched through downtown Charleston on a Saturday afternoon
The VDARE Foundation, a white nationalist organization located in Berkeley Springs that espouses myriad of racist and anti-immigrant views and conspiracy theories, including the “great replacement theory” 
Mountain State Contingency Group, a statewide militia

According to the SPLC, there was one more hate or extremist group active in West Virginia in 2024 compared to 2023. Several of the groups listed in 2023 — mostly militias and white nationalist groups — were not on the 2024 report.
Nationwide, the number of hate and extremist groups identified by the SPLC is declining. 
Last week’s report showed an almost 5% decline in the number of hate and antigovernment groups operating from 2023 to 2024. But on a call with reporters upon the report’s release, representatives for the SPLC said that trend is not encouraging. Instead, it is likely the result of far-right extremism becoming more mainstream in otherwise accepted groups and movements.
“After years of courting politicians and chasing power, hard-right groups are now fully infiltrating our politics and enacting their dangerous ideology into law,” said Margaret Huang, president of the SPLC. “Extremists at all levels of government are using cruelty, chaos and constant attacks on communities and our democracy to make us feel powerless.”XX

Patrick Morrisey announced last week that the state sent a SNAP waiver request to the federal government asking to remove soda from being an eligible item under the program. (West Virginia Office of Gov. Patrick Morrisey video screenshot)It’s honestly like West Virginia’s leaders have no idea who West Virginians are, or can’t remember where they came from.
I guess being rich, coming from a family of politicians or being from New Jersey could be the reason for some of that.
West Virginia is one of the 10 poorest states in the nation. We rely heavily on federal funding for our state budget. But instead of working to lift people out of poverty, our state government and our congressional delegation is following the lead of President Donald Trump and making things worse.
Last week, Gov. Patrick Morrisey announced that he formally asked the federal government to disallow the state’s food assistance program from paying for soda. 
“For a long time I’ve talked about the fact that SNAP — the N should stand for nutrition,” Morrisey said in his video announcement. Well, it does stand for nutrition — the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.
Indiana and Nebraska became the first states in the nation to ban soda and energy drinks from public grocery aid benefits, such as SNAP. The United States Department of Agriculture approved the states’ requests last week, and both will go into effect Jan. 1, 2026.
The SNAP program is meant to “maintain the dignity” of participants by helping them buy groceries, said Eric Savaiano, manager for food and nutrition access for Nebraska Appleseed. He called the latest SNAP ban “poverty-shaming.”
“With the approval of this waiver, some of that dignity is stripped away,” Savaiano said.
Poverty-shaming is the perfect description of this bill, and others the West Virginia Legislature wanted to pass this past session.
Lawmakers tried to ban SNAP recipients from using their benefits to buy soft drinks and candy, but that bill never made it out of the House of Delegates. 
The state Senate tried to pass a bill that would have expanded work and training requirements for SNAP recipients. 
“We know from lots of studies, including some of our own, that mandating work reporting requirements disconnects people from access to food, but does not connect them to work,” said Rhonda Rogombé, health and safety policy analyst for the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy.
She said the bill, which died in House Finance, would have put pressure on the state’s food banks, which would have been tasked with filling in the gaps for people who lost SNAP benefits because of work requirements. 
Meanwhile the Trump administration is ending the USDA’s Local Food Purchase Assistance program that gave states federal funding to stock food pantries from local farms.
The Ohio Association of Foodbanks sent out an email to farmers announcing the program is being cut, and attached a notice from the USDA, which said that the Trump administration had “determined this agreement no longer effectuates agency priorities and that termination of the award is appropriate.” 
The Local Food Purchase Assistance Program authorized $900 million worth of locally raised produce for food banks. It will end on June 30.
On top of that, the U.S. House of Representatives last week approved the Trump administration’s “big, beautiful bill,” which is actually pretty ugly and will be devastating to those who use SNAP or Medicaid.
More than 500,000 West Virginians rely on Medicaid or Children’s Health Insurance Program,  and about 277,000 — or one in six — residents use SNAP benefits to get access to food. Kelly Allen, executive director of the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy, said the bill “feels like a really bad deal for West Virginians.”
The bill — which must still pass the U.S. Senate and be signed by President Donald Trump before becoming law — will shift some of the cost of SNAP to state governments.
Keep in mind, Morrisey has said he’s expecting a $400 million deficit beginning next fiscal year (something other state lawmakers have denied), and in 2022, more than 45% of the state’s total revenue came from federal grants, according to an analysis from Pew Charitable Trusts.
The “big, beautiful bill” will also make deep cuts to Medicaid, reducing the program by $625 billion over 10 years.
And what does West Virginia’s representation in Washington, D.C. have to say about the passage of this bill?
“This legislation will undoubtedly make the life of the average American better, and I am proud to support it on the House floor and help get it to President Trump’s desk,” Rep. Carol Miller said. “I urge my colleagues to do the same.”
Miller is a millionaire. Her husband owns five car dealerships and has a stake in a real estate company. 
Rich West Virginians aren’t living the same lives as the rest of us. When we don’t pay our bills, we don’t win a seat in the Senate like Sen. Jim Justice. We instead don’t eat, have our utilities turned off, go without medicine or lose our homes.
Maybe it’s not in our best interest to keep electing politicians who don’t know how the average West Virginian lives.

Twenty-three years is young for a person. But for a software system, it’s ancient.
That’s why Rhode Island election administrators are pushing to rejuvenate the technology used to collect and share information about campaign finance donations and spending.
But the makeover to the Rhode Island Board of Elections’ Electronic Reporting and Tracking System — colloquially referred to as “ERTS” — requires extra money from state lawmakers already fretting over the many demands pulling at the state’s purse strings. And how to store the last 23 years of reports from 1,300 candidates and committees in a way that people can still access and search remains in question.
Meanwhile, the clock is ticking. The span between the 2024 presidential election and the 2026 state and local races offers the largest window to upgrade software and train users. If not now, the state would have to wait till 2029.
A three-year delay increases the risk of the collapse of the entire system, said Miguel Nunez, Rhode Island Board of Elections executive director.  It also would mean another three years of spending — $70,000 in fiscal 2026 alone —- on an outdated system vulnerable to security threats. 
“At this point, I find it a priority to try and enhance the system because it is so old at this point,” Nunez said in an interview Wednesday. “It is essentially just being, year-to-year, maintained, with no enhancements, no improvements.”
A work order submitted by the board’s existing vendor, Civix, could launch the long-awaited upgrade in July and be ready in time for the 2026 state election cycle. The shift to ERTS 2.0 offers better security and a more user-friendly interface for candidates and the public, and complies with updated state reporting requirements, Nunez told the board at its May 16 meeting.
The elections panel postponed a vote authorizing the contract until its June 3 meeting, to give Nunez time to make the case for the $140,000 in fiscal 2026 funding needed for the upgrades. The first-year expense includes the license and costs for Civix to provide training and troubleshooting, according to the proposed work order by the company, based outside of New Orleans. The elections panel in its fiscal 2026 funding request to the state sought $250,000 for software upgrades. But the request did not make it into Gov. Dan McKee’s $14 billion spending proposal unveiled in January.
Nunez on Wednesday had yet to talk to McKee or legislative leaders but said he planned to “in the coming days.”
McKee’s office did not immediately respond to inquiries for comment Thursday.
And the final authority on the state’s annual final tax-and-spend plan, House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi, remains noncommittal.
“This is just one in a continuously growing number of asks in an extremely challenging budget year,” Shekarchi, a Warwick Democrat said in an email Thursday. “We are reviewing all the requests.”
The $140,000 first-year cost to upgrade campaign finance software is nearly twice the $69,492 needed for Civix provide service on the legacy campaign finance system, according to cost estimates Nunez presented to the elections panel. 
Under Civix’s proposal, the state would pay nearly $815,000 over five years for the upgrades and continued service. By comparison, it would cost $377,000 over the next five years to maintain the existing system, which includes a 5% increase in the year-to-year contract with Civix.

The cost of doing nothing 
“We shouldn’t be running 20-year-old systems,” Randy Jackvony, an elections board member who works in IT, said in an interview. “I’ve seen other cases with other vendors where when something is way past the end-of-life, the price can jack up incredibly high because they just don’t have the resources to address technical issues.”
Ric Thornton, state campaign finance director, suspects Rhode Island is the lone state still using Civix’s legacy system. Meanwhile, four other jurisdictions — the states of Georgia and Pennsylvania and the cities of Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Aurora, Colorado, already use the upgraded software administered by Civix, Thornton said in an interview.
Many of the Civix engineers who developed and know how to troubleshoot the legacy software are nearing retirement age, or have already retired, Nunez said.
Civix declined to comment on its services or staff, referring questions back to the Rhode Island elections board. 
“If the system goes down and no one can fix it, we might be looking at reverting to paper filings, which is in violation of state law,” Nunez told the board during its May 16 meeting. “And it could not be conducive to efficiency and transparency.”

Keeping it legal
Since 2002, Rhode Island has required candidates and committees raising or spending more than $10,000 a year, or maintaining a minimum $25,000 account balance, to report quarterly campaign finance activities electronically through its software platform. Candidates and committees not subject to the criteria often opt to use the software to submit their financial reports anyway. Just 15% of finance reports are sent in by email or pen and paper form, Nunez said.
Electronic reporting could be even higher if the state’s software was able to accept specialized reports. A 2012 state law passed two years after the U.S. Supreme Court’s Citizens United v. FEC decision requires political action committees to disclose all independent donors and campaign expenses, including on advertising. But the existing ERTS system can’t accept such reports, forcing roughly 75 applicable super PACs to file 200 reports each year by email or through a document upload service, Nunez said.










If the system goes down and no one can fix it, we might be looking at reverting to paper filings, which is in violation of state law.


– Miguel Nunez, executive director for the Rhode Island Board of Elections


Another law which took effect in 2024 requires vendors awarded state contracts worth $5,000 or more to file affidavits with the elections board detailing political contributions. But the existing software offers no way to track submissions from vendors affirming they don’t make any contributions — their submissions are “simply not logged,” Nunez said.
Security considerations 
Upgrading ERTS also provides much-needed security enhancements, including multi-factor authentication, for candidates and committees that submit reports. Under the existing system, if a user forgets their password, only the state elections staff can reset it — posing potential access problems during critical reporting deadlines if the password snafu happens on a weekend and a staffer doesn’t respond right away, Nunez said.
The existing system also leaves the door open to hackers who could, potentially, manipulate the campaign numbers being submitted, said Ken Block, a software engineer who owns Warwick-based data mining company Simpatico Software Systems. Block, who founded the Rhode Island Moderate Party and ran unsuccessfully as an independent gubernatorial candidate in 2014, saw an urgent need for the upgrade.
“Twenty years is a pretty long time in the software world,” Block said. “It’s not unreasonable that the board would find themselves needing to go out and procure a new one.”
The elections board asked Civix, its software vendor since 2002, to propose a better system instead of seeking competing proposals for new software. Nunez cited the short time window to complete the upgrade, as well as the highly specialized nature of the service, as reasons why.
“It’s not a whole new purchase, it’s a modest upgrade to a newer platform,” Nunez said.
Jackvony wasn’t bothered by the lack of a formal request for proposals.
“If you’ve got a good relationship with a vendor, and feel confident, that’s not out of place,” Jackvony said. “It is somewhat common in IT, at least the private sector.”
Jackvony also said the price Civix quoted seemed reasonable, with hourly rates lower than those he vetted for his day job as chief information officer for Rhode Island Medical Imaging. He said his back-and-forth with the vendor on technical details of its proposal further boosted his confidence in them.
“They were incredibly responsive and detailed,” Jackvony said. 
What about the old data?
One wrinkle still not totally ironed out: What happens to the last 23 years of campaign reports? 
Civix’s proposal calls for archiving pre-2023 data as “static read-only” PDFs — meaning not searchable or incorporated into the more modern data interface. Nunez said in an interview that the staff was working with Civix on how to make the PDFs searchable, though he acknowledged they would not be able to be aggregated with the new system data.
“That’s crap,” said Block. “I don’t understand why they can’t move all the data into the new system. They should be able to do that no problem.”
Nunez explained it would be too time consuming and expensive to ask Civix to transfer all existing campaign finance data into the new software. However, he acknowledged he never asked the company what it could cost.
John Marion, executive director of Common Cause Rhode Island, shared serious concerns about losing public access to historic campaign finance data under the transition to better software.
“It doesn’t appear the board is focused on an important part of transparency, which is access to historic data,” he said. “Members of the public, and especially members of the media, often need access to older data in order to make comparisons to what is happening now.”
Marion continued, “It’s good the old data will be there but it remains to be seen how easy it will be to access.”

RFK Jr. calls miners' health ""priority.""","Brendan Demich speaks at a rally outside HHS offices in Washington, D.C. on May 22. (AFGE webstream)Brendan Demich was on a bus to Washington, D.C. last week to attend a rally outside the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ office.
At the same time, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was assuring lawmakers that critical programs in his department, specifically those protecting coal miners, would continue despite drastic cuts to his agency’s staff and budget.
It was the third in a series of contentious hearings for Kennedy. And for Demich, a Pennsylvania employee of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), a research agency in Kennedy’s department, they were hard to stomach.  
He’s part of a roughly 100-person team at NIOSH’s Bruceton facility in Allegheny County that studies the best ways to prevent injuries, illnesses and death in coal mines. Last month, he and all of his colleagues were notified that their jobs would be eliminated in June. Another team in Spokane, Washington, focused on safety in non-coal mines received similar notices. 
Combined, they conduct the bulk of the agency’s mine safety research.
“[Kennedy]’s claiming that he hasn’t fired any scientists, and that the only people that they’re cutting are doing duplicative work, but that is absolutely not the case,” Demich told the Capital-Star. “Our titles may be engineers, but we do science … And there’s no other agency that does the work we do here at NIOSH.”
The picture Demich paints is different from Kennedy’s.
“The work at NIOSH will not be interrupted,” Kennedy responded to a question from a lawmaker about layoffs. “The work on mine safety will continue. We understand it’s critically important to function and we don’t want to see it end.”
The hearings took place over the last three weeks after reports emerged that critical and legally required programs to help miners with black lung disease were no longer functioning, after an estimated 90% of NIOSH’s roughly 1400 full-time staff were laid off, offered early retirement or placed on administrative leave pending termination in early April.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Miners developing black lung, an irreversible and degenerative disease, were suddenly not able to get approved for a program facilitating transfers to less dusty mines. Black lung screenings that can help miners with the disease receive federal benefits were also stopped. 
This led to a class action lawsuit and pressure from Republican lawmakers to reverse the layoffs of federal workers whose jobs were ensuring mine safety.
So, earlier this month, Kennedy brought back over 300 NIOSH employees, including the Morgantown team that studies black lungs and ensures benefits for programs for miners who develop it continue to function. 
Kennedy also restored a team focused on the health of 9/11 first responders, as well as a team that works on the same Pittsburgh campus as Demich’s that tests and certifies respirators used by miners, firefighters and other professionals.
But Demich’s division is still expecting to be laid off.
Earlier this month, at a meeting, Demich said Pittsburgh employees in the mine safety division were told they no longer had to come into work, though a handful still do.
There had been hope with the Trump administration’s rhetoric around increasing coal mining and U.S. Health Department’s statements on the importance of miner safety that the job cuts would be reversed. But when NIOSH staff in other departments were brought back, Demich said, ”it crushed morale in the mining division. A lot of people see it as writing on the wall that we’re not being saved.”
The Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to detailed questions from the Capital-Star about future plans for the mine research divisions. But a spokesperson provided a statement saying, “Secretary Kennedy has been working hard to ensure that the critical functions under NIOSH remain intact. The Trump administration is committed to supporting coal miners and firefighters, and under the Secretary’s leadership, NIOSH’s essential services will continue as HHS streamlines its operations. Ensuring the health and safety of our workforce remains a top priority for the Department.”
Demich finds HHS statements on preserving critical programs frustrating, given the cuts on his and similar teams.
“I don’t know how you can say that you’re maintaining essential services for coal workers and miners when you’re cutting the divisions that mainly do the research and provide the services to prevent mine injuries, illnesses and fatalities,” he said. “Our work does not overlap at all with the [Morgantown] division, other than that we both want to prevent black lung.”

‘Those functions are going to disappear’ 
There is virtually no operational mine in the United States that hasn’t implemented safety measures based on research conducted by NIOSH.
The U.S. government got into mine safety research when the Bureau of Mines was established in 1910, after a series of deadly explosions killed hundreds of miners in just a few short years. The bureau was tasked with researching safer practices, inspecting mines and collecting data on the industry.
The work was successful. For decades, miner fatality rates steadily and precipitously decreased. That continued after the Bureau of Mines was shuttered and effectively rolled into the Department of Health and Human Services in the 1990s, where it now sits.
NIOSH’s mine safety divisions don’t set or enforce rules, but research it conducts has led to breakthroughs in technology that detects coal dust levels in real time, prevents mine roofs from collapsing, increases mineshaft ventilation and provides barriers between miners and powerful explosions.
“Those functions are going to disappear and I’m not quite sure who else would be able to do those,” said Tony Iannacchione, a former employee of NIOSH’s coal mine safety team who now teaches at the University of Pittsburgh’s Swanson School of Engineering. “There’s some pretty unique expertise. And if you don’t have a government agency that’s keeping its thumb on the pulse and coming up with modifications and improvements to the systems being used in mines, we’re gonna be in a bad way.”
Iannacchione says that work is only getting more important. The more coal that’s extracted, the deeper miners have to dig to find it. That makes for more dangerous mines and requires new research and safety protocols.
“As you go deeper, you get higher concentrations of methane gas and all these problems just get worse,” he said. “For the industry to react to all these problems, it’s really beyond their capability. You need the government involved.”
Iannacchione cited recent NIOSH research that set new industry standards for blast walls that are placed between miners and explosives, as well as new methods for placing roof supports. The Pittsburgh team has also done extensive work on preventing hearing loss, which is an issue in underground mines that are full of loud machinery.
The coal mine safety team in Pittsburgh is also developing technology that can read silica dust levels in real time, but that has yet to be deployed. As miners dig into tougher terrain, they’re exposed to much more silica dust, which has led to an increase in the development of silicosis and black lung among younger miners and develops at an accelerated rate. Widespread use of real time monitors, Iannacchione said, could save lives. But it’s unclear if the work will be finished by the time the layoffs fully take effect in June.
Demich, the chief steward of the union representing Pittsburgh-area NIOSH workers, said he was working on a virtual reality training program for first responders and rescue teams to simulate mine disasters. They had begun training teams around the country, but the cuts effectively ended that work. He believes, with a little more time, they could have brought it to almost every mine rescue team in the U.S.
Benefit of the doubt’ 
Sam Petsonk has been an advocate for coal miners for his entire career. The West Virginia-based lawyer led the recent lawsuit against the Department of Health and Human Services that resulted in an injunction ruling last week, effectively requiring the return of NIOSH workers running Black Lung programs in Morgantown.
He successfully argued that the department was breaking the law by effectively shuttering congressionally-approved programs for miners with black lung by laying off the staff that implemented them. But, as he sees it, the law also requires the kind of research done by NIOSH’s teams that are still facing layoffs.
“These Pittsburgh programs are every bit as mandatory under the Mine Act,” Petsonk told the Capital-Star. “I would like to give Secretary Kennedy a bit of the benefit of the doubt here that he’s still digesting his obligations here.”
But the mandate is far less clear, with statute generally requiring NIOSH to conduct “research, demonstrations, and experiments” to support the Department of Labor’s Mine Safety and Health Administration, which sets and enforces rules for mine companies to follow. 
The injunction ruling from U.S. District Court Judge Irene Berger focused on the availability of black lung programs, but also said “the Court orders that there be no pause, stoppage or gap in the protections and services mandated by Congress in the Mine Act and the attendant regulations for the health and safety of miners.”
Asked if he would bring a lawsuit if the mine safety research teams are not brought back, Petsonk said he wants to wait until the end of the 20-day period that Berger allowed to comply with the injunction. That will be on June 2.

“If they look at it, they will see the need to revive the mining research labs within NIOSH,” Petsonk said.
The Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to questions from the Capital-Star about whether it believes the injunction applies to the research teams, or whether law requires them to be operational.
“They should just follow the law and re-open the research labs in Pittsburgh and Spokane because miners need it,” Petsonk said. 
While it’s unclear if a legal remedy would be available to advocates like Petsonk who want mine safety research at NIOSH to continue, Demich is trying another way. When he was in Washington, D.C. last week, he and his NIOSH colleagues met with the staff of an estimated 15 to 20 lawmakers in an attempt to inform them about the research being lost and ask them to restore their jobs and research funding.
As it stands, even though Demich and his coworkers in Allegheny County are still technically employed, strict limits on research spending and travel would prevent them from doing a lot of their previous work.
Demich would not say which lawmakers’ staff he and his colleagues met with, since discussions are still ongoing. But he said the initial conversations were promising. He personally met with staff from lawmakers from Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia. He did note they were two Democrats and two Republicans.
“There’s a lot of questions about coal mines and about all the work we’re doing here in Pittsburgh,” Demich said. “A lot of people want  to follow-up and I think we’ll be reaching out.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Demich-speaks-at-rally-outside-HHS-May-22-1024x507.png,,,2025-05-27 06:09:15.769660

(Getty Images)Congress wants to make work reporting requirements in safety net programs harsher and more pervasive to remove supports from tens of thousands of Mainers and use that money to pay for tax cuts that overwhelmingly go to the wealthy. Maine has been down this road before and saw that work requirements take away help from people who need it and don’t support work.
The congressional bill currently under consideration would make work requirements harsher in three ways. It would:

Expand the existing requirement in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) for adults without dependents or a documented disability by increasing the age limit from 55 to 64, which will put 4,000 older adult Mainers newly at risk of losing food assistance.
Change the definition of “dependent” to only apply to children under the age of 7, which will put another 27,000 parents and caregivers of school-age kids at risk of losing food assistance. In total, 31,000 Mainers are likely to lose food assistance under these two changes.
Impose a similar work reporting requirement on the Medicaid (MaineCare) program for the first time in the program’s history. 34,000 Mainers are likely to lose health care under this change.

“Work requirements” are program cuts
While some Republicans have sought to portray work requirements as distinct from benefit cuts, the proven reality is these changes will remove millions of Americans from the affected programs, the majority of whom are working, caregiving, or suffering from a serious health condition that prevents them from working. Work requirements create a lot of new paperwork and administrative barriers.
According to the Maine Department of Health and Human Services, these would cost $6 million a year in additional administrative costs alone. The extra bureaucratic hoops also lead to the disenrollment of many people who are meeting the requirements but just get caught up in red tape. By one estimate, 13% of people impacted by the congressional proposal would not currently meet the work requirements for Medicaid and don’t qualify for an exemption, but the actual number who would lose care is three times higher (39%), meaning that the majority of people losing coverage already participate in the workforce or qualify for an exemption.
Approximately one third of Maine workers below traditional retirement age work less than full-time, year-round. In a seasonal economy like Maine’s, it can be particularly hard for people to meet a work reporting requirement on a consistent basis every month because the jobs simply aren’t available or the hours vary.
Many Mainers have health conditions that make it hard for them to work but are not always easy to prove to gain an exemption from a work requirement. As many as 110,000 Mainers aged 18 to 64 report having some kind of disability, but only 30,000 of them actually receive Social Security Disability benefits, leaving tens of thousands of Mainers with a harder time proving their disability to gain an exemption.
There are plenty of other obstacles to work that the bill doesn’t recognize. A 2021 survey of unemployed Mainers found that one in eight couldn’t work due to childcare problems, and 6% didn’t have reliable transportation.
Finally, it’s worth remembering that food and medical assistance are key to health and stability people need to engage in the labor force. Medicaid expansion has increased employment among adults with disabilities and SNAP has also been shown to help people find and keep employment by freeing up money for expenses like childcare. Taking both away from folks who can’t find consistent work will only make their barriers to employment worse as well as make it harder for them to get by in general.
Work requirements in Maine and elsewhere caused hardships without boosting work
Maine has prior experience with expanding work requirements that proved unsuccessful. In late 2014, then-Governor Paul LePage expanded work requirements in the SNAP program for adults without a documented disability who did not have children at home. Nearly three quarters of the SNAP recipients who were subject to the new requirements lost their benefits, with tens of thousands losing assistance over the next few years. Many of those who lost benefits were still unable to find work in the year afterwards, and those who did had incomes well below the poverty line. A 2017 survey of Mainers who lost SNAP benefits due to the LePage policy changes found that almost 80% of them had to use food pantries more often after the change, and 86% said it led to them making difficult choices between paying for food and other necessities like rent or health care.
National research shows similar patterns in the SNAP program — the federal work reporting requirement makes it much more likely that people will lose food assistance but does nothing meaningful to help those folks find work.
Recently several states have experimented with work requirements in Medicaid, with similarly poor results:

Under Arkansas’ temporary Medicaid work requirement, one in four people subject to the new test lost their health care coverage, most of whom could not get alternative health insurance, and there was no evidence of increased employment as a result.
Georgia imposed the work requirement when they expanded Medicaid coverage under the Affordable Care Act. One year into the program, just 2% of people thought to be eligible for the program have enrolled, leaving hundreds of thousands of people unable to get health care. This is despite the state spending millions of dollars on consultants to conduct an outreach campaign.
New Hampshire suspended its Medicaid work requirement after it had trouble even notifying impacted enrollees about the change. Despite multiple outreach efforts, nearly half of the people potentially subject to the work requirement didn’t even receive notices from the state. Of those assessed for the work requirement, only one third were judged to be meeting it when the policy was suspended.

Congress is at risk of repeating the mistakes made in Maine and other states and expanding them to the whole country in its reconciliation bill. Work requirements are efficient at taking food and health care away and creating more costly rules for states, but they don’t lead to more people working. Tens of thousands of Mainers will lose access to health care and food assistance and will suffer real hardships as a result.

Andy Beshear's Derby eve event mingle in the courtyard of the Old Governor's Mansion in Frankfort, May 2, 2025. (Kentucky Lantern photo by Tom Loftus)FRANKFORT, Ky. —  Again this year, Gov. Andy Beshear has refused to identify friends and political supporters who buy prime tickets to the Kentucky Derby made available by Churchill Downs for the governor’s entourage.
The governor’s office responded to an Open Records Act request from the Lantern with a letter saying it has no records of who got the tickets or who was invited to Beshear’s black-tie Derby eve party at the Old Governor’s Mansion in Frankfort.
The office referred questions about the tickets and the party to a nonprofit corporation Beshear created at the outset of his administration to act as broker for his Derby tickets and manage the party.
But the nonprofit, First Saturday in May Inc., is not covered by the Kentucky Open Records Act. And as it did last year, First Saturday refused the Lantern’s request to review details of its income and spending. It ignored the Lantern’s questions asking how many tickets it bought this year, the cost of the tickets and to whom the tickets were sold.
First Saturday did, however, release a copy of its most recent (2023-24) tax return, which it is required by law to do. The tax return reveals only basic financial information — $990,000 in income that year and $965,000 in expenses.
First Saturday reported in that tax return that it is a 501(c)(4) charitable organization whose mission is “to organize and manage events for the promotion of economic development in the Commonwealth of Kentucky.”
The nonprofit released a brief statement to the Lantern which noted its role in hosting the state’s “economic development and tourism guests at the Kentucky Derby.”
But the statement also acknowledged, “Additional tickets to the Kentucky Oaks and Kentucky Derby were privately purchased from Churchill Downs by the First Saturday in May at no expense to the Commonwealth.”
This is the only hint from First Saturday of the substantial payments it has received in recent years from Democratic Party groups — particularly the Democratic Governors Association, or DGA.
The 2025 Kentucky Derby was run as Beshear explores a campaign for president in 2028. Beshear’s national profile was enhanced in December when his fellow Democratic governors elected him vice chair of the DGA and as chair-elect for 2026.
The DGA used the events of Beshear’s Derby weekend — including the private formal party on Derby Eve —  as a fundraiser this year. And disclosures filed by the association with the Internal Revenue Service show that it has maintained a close relationship with First Saturday in May since Beshear first became governor.
The IRS calls 501(c)(4) groups “social welfare organizations” which are permitted to participate in some political activity as long as politics isn’t their primary purpose.
The Democratic Governors Association did not respond to numerous phone messages and emails from the Lantern.
For its part, Churchill Downs refused to answer questions from the Lantern.
 Precedent broken

Last year the Lantern reported that Beshear broke from the practice of his four immediate predecessors  — including his father Steve Beshear, governor from 2007-15 — by refusing to release lists of those who bought Derby tickets from the allotment set aside by Churchill Downs for the governor. 
Several news reports dating back to 1999 published lists released by those governors of the people who bought their tickets from a large allotment set aside by Churchill Downs for purchase at face value by the governor’s guests. The practice was to release lists of actual buyers of the tickets to reporters after the Derby, when the records were no longer considered preliminary.
According to those news reports, each year a small portion of those tickets were bought by state government to host official guests — job creators and tourism promoters. Most tickets were bought by  political donors, lobbyists, administration officials and friends.

That is apparently the case this year. The “spending search” function on state government’s “Transparency” website shows that the state has paid First Saturday $106,291 so far this year — apparently for the cost of tickets and related expenses for the official guests.
But the number of such official guests — job creators and tourism promoters from out of state — is not large. The Beshear administration has said 40 such guests were entertained at the 2024 Derby.
The past news articles reported that Churchill sold as many as 553 Derby tickets to the governor’s group while Democrat Paul Patton was governor in 1999, and as few as 237 in 2016 under Republican Matt Bevin. 
Critics quoted in those articles questioned the propriety of Churchill — an entity closely regulated by the state and a massive political donor — making so many tickets available to the governor — far more tickets than needed for the official state guests. 
The ability to buy a prime Derby ticket at face value is a rare opportunity. Demand exceeds supply and many Derby fans must go online to the secondary market to buy tickets at high prices set by sellers.
Norman Ornstein, an authority on ethics in government and emeritus scholar at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, told the Lantern last year that he was not so bothered by this potential conflict of interest. “My only question now would be: Why are you not letting us know what other governors have let us know?” Ornstein said.
 First Saturday and the Democratic Governors Association

One conclusion that can be drawn from available public records about First Saturday in May is that from its creation it has had a close relationship with the Democratic Governors Association.
The DGA and its affiliated nonprofit group are required to file finance reports with the Internal Revenue Service. Those reports show that since First Saturday in May was created in 2019 through the end of 2024 the DGA has paid it $491,000.
(The specific payments were: $105,000 in January 2022; $172,200 in February 2023; $37,300 in April 2023; $26,500 in March 2024. Also, a DGA affiliated non-profit named America Works USA reported that it made a $150,000 grant to First Saturday in early 2020.)
The DGA is not required to disclose its receipts and spending for the first half of 2025 until July.
The Lexington Herald-Leader reported in April that the DGA used Derby weekend as a fundraising opportunity.

Andy Beshear has refused to disclose who buys coveted Derby tickets from the allotment that Churchill Downs sets aside for the governor. The Beshears were photographed on election night, 2023.

An invitation obtained by the Lexington Herald-Leader said that for a $15,000 donation ($25,000 for two people) a guest would get a ticket to the Oaks, the Derby and the Beshears’ gala at the Old Governor’s Mansion. The gala was not exclusively for the DGA donors and the state’s economic development guests. Beshear Communications Director Crystal Staley said, “Many different people from a variety of groups attend the gala.”
The DGA’s fundraiser invitation offered the opportunity for donors to not only party with Beshear, but also three other Democratic governors: The 2024 Democratic nominee for vice president Tim Walz of Minnesota, Maura Healey of Massachusetts and Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico.
Last year a DGA spokesperson told the Lantern that the DGA has hosted events in Kentucky on Derby weekend for many years.
Besides the DGA, other political groups have made payments to First Saturday.
The Kentucky Democratic Party has reported to the FEC that it has paid a total of $99,370 since May of 2022 to First Saturday. And the Democratic Attorneys General Association has disclosed to the IRS that it has paid First Saturday $24,400.
 New leadership for First Saturday in May

First Saturday in May Inc. was formed by Beshear soon after his first inauguration in December 2019. It was not a unique idea; governors going back to Paul Patton had created similar nonprofits to handle expenses of their Derby activities.
Records of Kentucky’s secretary of state show that in mid-February this year, the leadership of the nonprofit changed. Lindy Karns, Beshear’s CPA who also has served as treasurer of his campaign committees, is no longer treasurer and contact person for First Saturday. Jack Dulworth, a Louisville businessman and longtime Beshear supporter, moved from the president’s job to vice president. The new president is Jonathan Smith, who has worked closely with Beshear since Beshear’s 2015 campaign for attorney general.
(Officers of First Saturday receive no salaries, according to the organization’s tax returns.)
Smith resigned last year as deputy chief of staff in the governor’s office. At the time of his resignation, the Herald-Leader reported that Smith “is seen by many political insiders as a liaison between Beshear and others in the political world.”

(Kentucky Lantern photo by McKenna Horsley)LOUISVILLE — An organization that led a statewide campaign against last year’s proposed constitutional amendment to allow the legislature to fund nonpublic schools is seeking more insight about education from communities across Kentucky. 
Protect Our Public Schools, which has transitioned to a wider education advocacy role following the defeat of Amendment 2 in November, was one of the highest fundraising political action committees against the amendment. Now, the coalition has launched a listening tour in 10 Kentucky cities to gather input and build a campaign for pro-education legislation in Frankfort.
Ahead of a forum in Louisville on Thursday, Jefferson County Teachers Association President Maddie Shepherd told reporters that Protect Our Schools is “in a unique position right now to chart a course for our kids’ future.” She said the feedback the organization collects in the 10 forums “will inform a larger, broader shared campaign about what all of Kentucky schools need.” 
Addison Lowry, a Jefferson County high school student, said that “community leaders and local voices were the key” to the movement against Amendment 2 last year and argued that the same strategy will be effective in campaigning on behalf of public education in the future. 
“This effort won’t be led by Frankfort lobbyists, but by the people who live with the consequences of decisions made in Frankfort every day — the folks who drive through the bus, the students who ride that bus, those who teach in classrooms, pack the lunches and raise the kids in our communities,” Lowry said. “We believe that those closest to the problem should be the ones helping shape the solution, and that’s exactly what this campaign is about.”

Protect Our Schools held its first listening stop in Owensboro. The next dates and locations are Bowling Green on June 10 and Lexington on July 15. The organization will announce future dates and locations online at protectourschoolsky.com. 
During a forum, those who attend are asked about challenges in their communities and about what they would like teaching and learning for students to be in their areas. They also discuss how to make those goals a reality. 
Lowry said that by the end of the year, Protect Our Schools hopes to “have built a more localized, robust coalition than ever before ready to organize for the future students deserve.”
When lawmakers return to Frankfort in January for the 2026 legislative session, they will deliberate the next biennial state budget and decide which programs to fund with state dollars. Protect Our Schools plans to compile the feedback from its forums into a legislative campaign that focuses on reinvesting in the state’s public schools. 
Education funding has been a contentious topic between public school advocates and Republican lawmakers in recent years. While some groups like the Kentucky Education Association have argued paying teachers more would incentivize more people to go into the profession, Republicans have argued the General Assembly, controlled by the GOP, has provided a historic level of K-12 education funding. 
Public education funding nationwide has faced uncertainty as the Trump administration reviews federal funding for K-12 schools. In Kentucky, all but two school districts signed an agreement with the administration to adhere to new restrictions on diversity, equity and inclusion programs in public schools and avoid the possibility of losing federal funding. Recently, the U.S. Department of Education denied a $10.6 million request to extend COVID relief funding submitted by the Kentucky Department of Education on behalf of school districts for nine projects.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_4161-e1748113856313-1024x642.jpg,,,2025-05-27 06:09:15.769660

Last August, Highlander Elementary partnered with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW). In October, Paul Cuffee Upper School followed suit, joining Rhode Island’s American Federation of Teachers (AFT). In December, Cuffee’s Lower School joined them. Cuffee Middle School has not signed on.
Nationally, 70% of public district schools are unionized. As are roughly 11% of the teachers at charters, with 54% of those in states that mandate charter unionization. Charters are public schools — publicly funded, strictly held to the same public accountability as district schools, with students chosen by lottery systems when over-enrolled. 
Rhode Island’s charter approval vetting process is praised as one of the best, unlike the Wild West of, say, Arizona where lax approval laws let charters frequently open and close, disrupting families. Rhode Island charters are stable and highly attractive to families. 
But why would a charter give up its flexibility to join Rhode Island’s unions? With these negotiations underway now, several educators did not respond to my queries and those who did would only speak off the record. 
To find the answers, I conducted off-the-record interviews, read an announcement in an IBEW newsletter focusing on teacher voice and higher pay, and obtained an email recruitment pitch from a union organizer recently sent to charter schools. Three main issues emerged: 
Better benefits and pay
The critical issue with Rhode Island charter schools generally is that they operate with almost 20% less money, per pupil, than district schools. The Rhode Island Expenditure Council (RIPEC) put its exhaustive study of our charters in a national context that revealed uniquely inequitable funding between charters and district schools. The biggest gap drivers are:

Districts home to the charter building hold back at least 7% of the per pupil cost (PPE) for, as RIPEC put it, “so-called unique costs.” But then, districts can increase the amount using a complex series of calculations to claw back yet more of the PPE, with Woonsocket’s RISE charter topping out at a whopping 62% holdback. 
The state’s School Housing Aid Fund helps schools pay for renovations, new buildings and upgrades. A formula allocates at least 35% of the costs in low-poverty districts (Little Compton, Barrington) and up to 97% and 88% respectively in high-poverty districts (Central Falls, Woonsocket). Charters get a flat 30%, no matter what their needs or poverty level.
Municipalities and districts own the buildings. Charters must buy or rent and make all necessary repairs or risk losing their charter. Charters have no other resources to draw from.
Rhode Island’s charters are subject to extensive audits at least every five years. These accountability requirements are expensive, labor-intensive, time-consuming and inequitable because district schools have no such requirements. 

Surely, the charters would raise salaries immediately if they got their full per-pupil funding without all the holdbacks. The money is supposed to follow the kid. Furthermore, lower salaries make charters vulnerable to teacher poaching by districts. 
Also, charters often have specific missions — i.e., the Nurses Institute, the Greene School — to which the school must deploy resources. If the money is redeployed to, say, salaries, can these schools stay true to their mission? 
To raise salaries and benefits, where would the money come from? 
Answer: mostly by increasing class size. Charters’ smaller classes contribute to their efficacy and popularity. Especially post-COVID, virtually all kids need lots of support and help. Private and suburban schools have small classes. Often charters’ smaller classes attract teachers who want calmer environments where they can be more successful. 
More control over administrative decision making, a.k.a. “teacher voice” 
Schools with poor teacher feedback mechanisms invite conflict. A memo that dictates, “Here is the new rule (which is news to you); implement it tomorrow,” is infuriating.
Some authoritarian administrators only pretend to listen to staff, or they don’t share enough information about a decision to allow the faculty to weigh in on important decisions. Teachers experience them as oppressive.
Other administrators might invite conflict by running a tight ship, holding staff accountable or deploying resources to the mission for which they’ve been chartered when teachers want something else, like higher pay. Teachers often choose to teach (and stay) at charter public schools because they enjoy collaborating on challenges with their colleagues and leadership. Seemingly, something is not working at the unionizing charters. 
Legal protections and power
The email from the union recruiter says, “Our union offers legal protection and liability coverage. Unionized workers also cannot be fired or disciplined without just cause.” 
True, union dues pay for legal departments that protect district teachers from discipline and dismissal, usually to the detriment of the students. Burdensome state laws governing grievance procedures nearly prevent district staff from ever being disciplined. Since the charter teacher and administration would have to pay legal fees, an unprovoked dismissal is not in either parties’ interest. 
So, what now? 
The IBEW is a private-sector, construction union, not part of the state’s public-service union body politic. Incompetent construction workers get fired. Will the IBEW protect ineffective teachers? Also, do they have the clout or will to endure a fight for fair funding? Hard to know.
The far more powerful AFT leaders are crackerjack negotiators. Will Cuffee’s flexibility rigidify with adherence to their new contract? Or will negotiations include a wealth of carve-outs to provide the non-traditional practices consistent with the charter’s mission? 
Most importantly, will the AFT fight to get their charter partners full funding? Nationally, unions have been fighting charter schools since the movement began, mainly by working to hogtie them with underfunding (see item #1 above). Will the AFT represent these new schools with the same fervor as they once opposed them?

(Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)The ink is barely dry on the U.S. House’s version of the 2025 federal budget — the One Big Beautiful Bill Act— and Kentuckians have every reason to be concerned. 
The bill enacts nearly $700 billion in Medicaid cuts over the next decade, slashes billions more from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), and makes permanent a raft of tax cuts for the wealthiest individuals and corporations, as almost all of Kentucky’s congressional delegation hope against hope that tax breaks given to the wealthy eventually trickle down to everyday Kentuckians.
For families across Kentucky, these changes aren’t just political talking points; they are deeply personal. Medicaid provides health coverage for 1.4 million Kentuckians, including seniors in nursing homes, children with special needs and working parents who don’t receive health insurance through their jobs. 
SNAP supports over 575,000 Kentuckians in putting food on the table, leading the Kentucky Center for Economic Policy to recently conclude that “the damage of this plan (i.e., ‘One Big Beautiful Bill’) will far outweigh its meager to non-existent benefits for Kentucky families.” As such, these cuts will ripple through communities, likely shuttering rural hospitals, increasing food insecurity and shifting burdens onto already stretched local services and state budgets.
Economists offer a useful metaphor to explain why this kind of trickle-down economic policy falls short: the flypaper effect. Originally coined to describe how government grants stick with the agencies that receive them rather than flowing to the people those agencies serve, the concept applies nearly as well to tax cuts at the top of the income ladder. 
Like a fly on sticky paper, money tends to stay where it lands — accumulating in corporate coffers, stock buy-backs, executive bonuses, and the bank accounts and investment portfolios of the ultra-wealthy. And for what? More tax breaks for billionaires and corporations that are unlikely to reinvest in places like Benton, Beaver Dam or Beattyville. It rarely reaches Main Street in Hazard or helps struggling families in West Louisville. 
The One Big Beautiful Bill Act is little more than trickle-down economics repackaged, almost assuredly failing the vast majority of Kentuckians once again.
To be sure, the budget includes some small nods to the working class and retirees: Tips and overtime pay will be exempt from federal income tax. The bill also allows middle and low-income seniors a greater tax deduction on their Social Security benefits. 
While these gestures offer welcome relief to many Kentuckians in the service and hourly workforce, particularly in restaurant-heavy communities like Bowling Green or the manufacturing plants of Georgetown, and retirees, it pales in comparison to the sweeping, permanent tax benefits granted to the wealthiest of Americans.  A bone tossed to workers and retirees does little to offset the structural tilt of the budget toward concentrated wealth and corporate power.
As 2024 Nobel laureates Daron Acemoglu and James A. Robinson explain in “Why Nations Fail,” sustainable prosperity depends on inclusive institutions that broaden access to opportunity, not extractive ones that concentrate wealth and power among a privileged few. Make no mistake about this: with this next budget, we are moving further into the latter. Trickle-down economics assumes wealth will eventually filter to lower-income Americans, but in practice, it locks resources at the top, reinforcing inequality and stagnating opportunity.
We’ve seen the warning signs before. In the 1980s, massive federal tax cuts under President Ronald Reagan touted as trickle-down economics were followed by exploding deficits and cutbacks to vital services, which ultimately convinced Reagan and Congress to reverse many of those tax cuts. In 2017, under the first Trump administration, tax cuts promised economic growth that never materialized for most Americans. Wages in Kentucky barely budged, even as the wealthiest in the nation saw record gains.
Now, with the One Big Beautiful Bill Act passing the House, we are watching the same script play out. 
This time, the stakes are even higher for Kentuckians. In a state that already ranks near the bottom in health outcomes, slashing Medicaid funding will hurt both individuals and entire rural health systems. Meanwhile, cutting food assistance, although living costs continue to climb, will push more families toward the brink.
Kentucky’s economic challenges aren’t caused by working families asking for too much; they’re caused by policies that keep giving more to those who already have the most. Our commonwealth has seen what happens when coal jobs disappear, when opioid addiction ravages communities, and when opportunity is outsourced. What we need now isn’t another tax break at the top: We need strategic investment in our people and infrastructure.
The budget should be a reflection of our shared values. It should prioritize affordable and accessible health care in Berea, strong public schools in Covington, job training programs in Owensboro and small business development in Paducah. Instead, this budget undermines those possibilities and entrenches inequality — right here in the Bluegrass and across the nation.
The flypaper effect reminds us that where money lands matters. Right now, it’s not landing with ordinary Kentuckians. It’s sticking with the wealthiest Americans, while poor and working-class Kentuckians and our communities will shoulder the consequences. With the One Big Beautiful Bill, wealth sticks to wealth, power begets more power, and the cycle of inequality deepens.
Budgets are more than dry, technical financial blueprints; they are moral statements about who and what we value. If we truly value family and opportunity, then our national budget should reflect that. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act does not. We need a federal budget that works for the many, not for the privileges of the few.

(Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)The concern probably never occurred to you, but if it did, you can now put your mind at rest. Research confirms that the current era – our own modern-day version of the Roaring 20’s — remains a great time to be a billionaire. A new report from the global nonprofit Oxfam provides the numbers.
According to the report, which the Oxfam people gleaned from that chronicle of the ruling class, Forbes, the vast and immoral inequality that dominates the U.S. economy has reached truly stunning levels.
Among the key findings:

Despite recent tariff-related market turmoil, the 10 richest U.S. billionaires saw their wealth increase by $365 billion over the past 12 months.
It would take 726,000 years for 10 U.S. workers with median earnings to make that much money.
If the wealth gains of the 10 richest billionaires were taxed like income from work, they would owe a collective $135 billion in taxes.
A modest three percent tax on wealth over $1 billion would raise over $50 billion from the 10 richest U.S. billionaires alone. This is enough to cover the entire federal rental assistance budget or a year of food assistance for 22.5 million people.

In other words, life remains good for, alphabetically (an ordering system that would no doubt cause most of these men to cringe): Steve Ballmer, Jeff Bezos, Sergey Brin, Warren Buffet, Larry Ellison, Elon Musk, Larry Page, Jim Walton, Rob Walton, and Mark Zuckerberg.
What’s more, the chance that American elected leaders might actually pursue any policy options remotely akin to what those radicals at Oxfam suggest has been firmly put to rest for the foreseeable future.
Indeed, thanks to votes last week in both the U.S. and North Carolina Houses of Representatives, things are soon likely to get even better for the Big 10, as well as for the thousands of other millionaires and billionaires who make up America’s top 1%.
The action in Washington, of course, centered around Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” – an 1,116-page monstrosity that seeks to make much of the Heritage Foundation’s infamous Project 2025 a reality.
Topping the list of billionaire-boosting provisions: a package of tax changes that will further enrich the Big 10 and their ilk and further enfeeble core federal government structures and services.
As the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities reported, “Under the bill, the top 1 percent of people would receive tax cuts three times the size of those for people with incomes in the bottom 60 percent, measured as a share of after-tax income. The top 0.6 percent of people — the 1.2 million people with annual incomes above $1 million — would receive more total tax cuts than the 127 million people with incomes below $100,000.”
The bill would also slash core social safety net programs like Medicaid and SNAP food assistance. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office reports that the bill will lead to 3.2 million people losing food assistance benefits, while saddling states with around $14 billion a year in new costs — if, that is, they decide to take them on.
Meanwhile, on the same day the U.S. House approved its bill on a 215-214 vote – a vote made possible in large part by the gerrymandering that gave Republicans three extra seats in the North Carolina congressional delegation – Republicans in the North Carolina House approved their version of a new, omnibus state budget bill.
And while Gov. Josh Stein and several Democratic lawmakers have adopted the pragmatic strategy of praising parts of the bill for not veering as far off the rails as the Senate version that was approved earlier this spring, average North Carolinians should harbor no illusions about the direction the bill takes the state.
As the North Carolina Budget and Tax Center observed, the bill “continues to prioritize tax cuts for corporations and the rich — as well as building up reserve funds for corporate giveaways — above raising employee pay, making child care more affordable, keeping college tuition low, and the numerous other issues impacting quality of life for the average North Carolinian.”
Indeed, in a move that the Big 10 and their minions have undoubtedly already happily noted, the bill will continue to advance the GOP’s destructive and regressive scheme to repeal the state corporate income tax. As the BTC notes, that part of the House’s plan “will cost the state about $235 million over the biennium, and 94 percent of that tax giveaway will flow to out-of-state residents.”
What’s next for these two bills is somewhat unclear. While there remains some faint hope that the U.S. Senate could temper some of the worst program cuts, the expectation in Raleigh is that the state Senate will move aggressively to push things further to the right – a push that Stein and House Democrats (who theoretically possess the ability to sustain a gubernatorial veto) will be hard-pressed to resist.
And sadly, the chance that either package will be amended to include anything akin to the modest billionaire tax proposal suggested by Oxfam (or any other change that might alter the destructive, rich-getting-richer trend that dominates America’s trickle-up economy) remains less than zero.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/elonmuskmarch52025-1024x731.jpg,,,2025-05-27 06:09:15.769660

John Robinson is pictured on the far left of the back row. (Photo courtesy of Encyclopedia of Virginia)A Northern Virginia faith leader and parent said she will continue asking state lawmakers to make two African-American history courses count towards the state’s graduation requirements for history, after the governor — who vetoed the measure and whose four-year term is sunsetting — leaves office.
Pastor Michelle Thomas, president of the NAACP Loudoun Branch, and Robin Reaves Burke of the Loudoun Freedom Center proposed the concept to state Del. David Reid, D-Loudoun, shortly after the commonwealth added African American History and AP African American Studies to the list of courses permitted to be taught in public high schools. 
Sen. Lamont Bagby, D-Henrico, and Reid successfully passed the proposal through the General Assembly with some amendments. On March 24, Gov. Glenn Youngkin proposed an amendment requiring the General Assembly to pass the proposal again in 2026, but lawmakers did not accept it. Youngkin then vetoed the bill, stating that it would cause students to miss “key concepts essential to understanding how historical world events have shaped our modern economy, government, and international relations.” 
Thomas was surprised and disappointed by the decision, she said.
“You can’t divorce African American history from the founding of America. It is the absolute foundation of American history, and so to try to marginalize this and say students shouldn’t be learning it, or it’s not as important as mainstream history, or the history that he’s trying to tell is absolutely ridiculous,” Thomas said in a statement last week.

Thomas said she first considered proposing the legislation after her daughter was interested in taking an African American studies course and seeking flexibility with her class schedule towards meeting her graduation requirements. 
Under Virginia’s standard diploma requirements, students are required to take U.S. History, Virginia and U.S. Government, and either World History or Geography. The bill would have given the students the option to substitute African American History or AP African American Studies studies with World History or Geography.


Virginia’s diploma requirements concerning history
Standard Diploma
US History
Virginia and U.S. Government
One other course in World History or Geography
Advanced diploma
All four are required.
Proposed standard diploma (House Bill 1824 in the 2025 GA session – vetoed by governor)
US History
Virginia and U.S. Government
World History or Geography or African American Studies or AP African American Studies


“While I am supportive of expanding choices in what classes students may take to satisfy graduation requirements, we must ensure that classes that replace others are germane to the comprehensive goals of high school education standards,” Youngkin wrote in his veto statement.
But Thomas defended the proposal. 
“We’re not saying ‘do away’ or ‘you can take this or that.’ You can take all of them,” Thomas said. “You can take World History II, if parents feel like World History I and World History II are important. But for those parents (and students) who believe African American history is also and equally important, allow them to get graduation credit for it.”
She said she also believes the governor’s decision falls in line with a national agenda to minimize or remove public references to Black history, and could align with his future political plans.
The curriculum has been continually debated by the public, education leaders and Youngkin’s administration during the governor’s entire time in office, which concludes in January. The first AP African American studies course was added last year, but not without controversy — Youngkin’s education department proposed dozens of revisions before its approval, the Washington Post reported.
Reid said in a statement that he was disappointed by the governor’s decision and plans to reintroduce the bill at the next session, beginning in January. 
“The governor chose to ignore the very values he outlined in Executive Order One on his first day in office — his stated commitment to teach the full story of American history,” said Reid. “Instead, he allowed political fear to override principle and missed an opportunity to give parents and students more choice in how they learn our shared history.”
He also said Virginia history and African American history are important parts of America’s origin story, citing the significance of the first House of Burgesses — the first democratically-elected legislative body in what would become America — and the arrival of the first Africans in present-day Hampton, both defining events that took place in Virginia roughly two weeks and 40 miles apart.
“Virginia history is African American history, is American history,” Reid said. “Our children deserve to learn the truth of our shared story — and they deserve the freedom to choose how they learn it.”

(Photo by Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)Before a federal judge temporarily halted the dissolution of the agency Thursday, the U.S. Department of Education ensured “uninterrupted services” to children and youth with disabilities, in response to probing questions by U.S. Senators from Virginia and other states about the future of special education.
The questions, spearheaded by Sen. Lisa Blunt Rochester of Delaware in a letter to Secretary of Education Linda McMahon, came after President Donald Trump and his administration launched efforts to dismantle the U.S. Department of Education. A key point of concern for the lawmakers was the one-month freeze on investigations into discrimination complaints that left a backlog of 12,000 complaints, “half of which involve students with disabilities,” Democratic U.S. Sens. Mark Warner and Tim Kaine of Virginia and 20 of their colleagues wrote.
The agency’s plans are of particular significance for Virginia, where a federal investigation found that the Virginia Department of Education failed to meet federal requirements to help resolve disputes involving students with disabilities beginning in 2019.
In December 2024, the investigation ended after the Office of Special Education Programs wrote in a letter that all of its findings and required actions for the agency were closed.
Virginia was responsible for nearly 186,000 students with disabilities this past school year, an increase of almost 5,000 students from the 2023-24 academic period. As federal law requires, Virginia must provide all students with disabilities a “free and appropriate public education” through personalized plans under the Individualized Education Program (IEP).
Facing special ed teacher shortage, Va. education board votes to expand educator pipeline

Sarah Ursprung, acting assistant secretary for legislation and congressional affairs for the federal department, wrote to lawmakers in April that no formula funding to states, including Title I and IDEA, was cut, and the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) continues its enforcement work with a reduced workforce and the same commitment to vigorous vindication of students’ civil rights.
“The department remains committed to ensuring uninterrupted services to meet the needs and develop the potential of children and youth with disabilities pursuant to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA),” Ursprung wrote in a letter provided to the Mercury.
The senators’ letter also highlighted their reservations about limited staff at the agency. U.S. Sens. Mark Warner and Tim Kaine from Virginia signed Rochester’s letter in April that said the cuts would have “immense harm” to all students.
“While we appreciate receiving a response from the Department of Education, we still have serious concerns about how the department can ensure services for students with disabilities aren’t interrupted when Secretary McMahon has already reduced staff by nearly 50% and said she intends to close the department,” the senators wrote. 
Ursprung said that no employees in the Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP), the Rehabilitation Services Administration or the National Center for Special Education Research (NCSER) were subject to the staff cuts on March 11. Employees involved in policy and administrative functions, whose duties the agency said can be reassigned or eliminated, were the ones subject to firing. 
NCSER-supported research continues with obligated funds, according to Ursprung. The research center helps experts understand more about children who have or may have disabilities by studying them from infancy through college.
The trajectory of the federal education department, and the fallout in Virginia, remains uncertain, after the Massachusetts federal judge paused its dismantling and ordered the Trump administration to reinstate over 1,300 employees. The department is expected to appeal the decision.

About a decade ago, Norfolk officials launched a lengthy federal process for what would become the largest infrastructure project in its history.
The $2.6 billion effort to protect the city from flooding during major storms is set to include an 8-mile seawall, home elevations, pump stations and massive surge barriers stretching across waterways.
The city now has more than another decade to go.
Norfolk officials signal changes are necessary for floodwall to move forward

Leaders from Norfolk and its federal partner, the Army Corps of Engineers, updated City Council last week on what is formally called the Coastal Storm Risk Management project.
It’s part of a series of similar projects planned along the East Coast, prompted by the devastation caused during Hurricane Sandy in 2012.
Norfolk is the furthest along, with other floodwalls in the works in cities including Charleston and Miami. Virginia Beach and the Peninsula are also in various stages of the pre-design study process through the Army Corps.
Here are the major updates.
 The project’s cost and timeline are growing.

The current, official price tag for what city leaders call Resilient Norfolk is still $2.6 billion – 65% of which would be covered by the federal government, leaving Norfolk on the hook for about $931 million.
But officials now estimate the cost will rise beyond what Congress approved in 2020.
Mark Haviland, spokesperson with the Army Corps’ Norfolk District, said in an email that “significant analysis was conducted to document the cost drivers and brief our higher headquarters.”
The Corps declined to share that analysis before it’s certified or provide a new cost estimate until the agency gets approval to finalize a related report.
But Haviland said some factors that influence cost include new survey data and hydrologic modeling that identified the need for additional pump stations, and updated designs for the wall’s foundation and transitions with adjoining levees.
“Wall types were also revised to meet updated barge impact requirements and to better fit within an urban setting and avoid impacts to the foundations of existing buildings,” he wrote.
In addition, the team encountered unexpected delays with the real estate certification process, which involves getting permits and legal permission to use land and negotiating agreements with property owners.
“By addressing these details early on, we can avoid costly delays and complications during construction,” Haviland wrote.
The estimated end date for all parts of the project is 2037, five years later than the original timeline.
The first section of the seawall will be constructed from Chesterfield Heights to the Berkley Bridge, with initial site work starting this year. The first surge barrier will cross the mouth of the Lafayette River, with construction beginning around 2029.
 Officials are still seeking changes to who and what in included behind the wall

The current path of the floodwall wraps around downtown, ending at Chesterfield Heights to the east and Lambert’s Point to the west.
That leaves out five historically Black neighborhoods across the river vulnerable to flooding. A coalition of residents on the Southside strongly resisted being excluded from the wall’s protection, and the city and Army Corps agreed to ask the federal government to reevaluate the path.
Two years later, the Norfolk District is still waiting for federal leaders to include such a study in their budget. Army Corps headquarters did not receive it for fiscal year 2025, meaning the earliest it could begin would be next year.
The Army Corps previously told WHRO a study could take around three years and $3 million, though the scope has not yet been developed. The re-evaluation report would also look at adding structural protection for Willoughby Spit.
Meanwhile, many residents of the historic Freemason neighborhood are fighting for the opposite.
Neighbors said they were blindsided by the floodwall plans and argue it will block waterfront views and tank property values.
Newly-approved state study aims to codify Virginia’s coastal resilience funding

Project officials say they’re just beginning to design the segment that includes Freemason, but will consider the community’s feedback and seek federal authorization to modify the path.
Several council members reiterated concerns this week.
“This is not the first time we talked about the authorized alignment in Freemason,” said Mayor Kenny Alexander. “For us, it’s a nonstarter.”
 Some individual homeowners can soon apply for help

One aspect of Resilient Norfolk is what officials call “nonstructural measures.”
That means helping private owners protect their property by elevating homes, filling in flood-prone basements and using floodproofing techniques at commercial properties.
The city said this week that nearly 1,000 properties on Willoughby Spit and the Southside are considered “pre-eligible” for the nonstructural program, which is voluntary.
Officials launched a new tool for people to type in their address and determine eligibility.
Congress authorized the project to include voluntary home buyouts, but the city says there are no plans to do so.

Greetings! 
I’m Emily Previti, the Pennsylvania Capital-Star’s first audio reporter, writing to introduce myself. 
Sometimes, I overthink. 
But after learning about this position, it was apparent relatively quickly – even to me – that this opportunity was a no-brainer: I could harness my experience to help fill a void in Pennsylvania’s media landscape with deeply reported, state policy-focused audio journalism. It’s a powerful medium I’ve long been passionate about for its unparalleled convenience, intimate engagement with audiences and ability to help people understand complex issues while they’re commuting, exercising or scrubbing their bathroom. 
  Emily Previti is the Pennsylvania Capital-Star’s newest staff member and will serve as its first audio reporter (Emily Previti)
Initially, you’ll be able to catch our audio content on the Pennsylvania Capital-Star’s website and other content channels. We’re also working to establish partnerships with radio stations throughout Pennsylvania. 
Ultimately, our goal is to produce our own podcast as well. 
You can expect news as well as deep dives and investigations that you won’t hear – or read – elsewhere. 
Tim Lambert, editor in chief, and I worked together for several years in public media. And when you’re expanding into new territory and launching initiatives, having established trust and history as colleagues out of the gate is a huge advantage. I also have a track record of finding stories that have been overlooked despite being highly relevant and telling them in an impactful, distinctive way. 
Most recently, I co-created and hosted the longform podcast Obscured through Kouvenda Media. The pilot series focused on survivors of traumatic police encounters and the support – or lack thereof – available to them. 
Before that, I spent several years as a senior reporter for WITF-FM and the statewide Keystone Crossroads collaboration, where I covered everything from refugee resettlement to housing discrimination to Pennsylvania’s redistricting battles to voting rights and election administration. I also created and produced The Context, a daily newsletter, and led investigations into Pennsylvania’s public defense system and other issues affecting communities across the commonwealth that earned awards on the state, regional and national levels.
I came to Pennsylvania, originally, to cover Harrisburg’s debt crisis beat at PennLive after working as a watchdog reporter for The Press of Atlantic City investigating the casino industry and state and local government corruption. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Throughout, my professional goals have been relatively straightforward, even as navigating the industry and the reporting process itself have proven complicated and challenging at times. 
I aim to tell nuanced, engaging stories that expose root causes of persistent problems and help people understand how policies actually affect them. And to add value to the media landscape with contextual, conversational stories that explore important angles otherwise glossed over or missed entirely with reporting that synthesizes history, data, personal narratives, accountability, policy analysis and potential solutions and alternate approaches.
I also believe in meeting audiences where they are, as do the Pennsylvania Capital-Star and States Newsroom. Some of you prefer to read your news, others want to listen during your commute. Still others want quick updates on social media. Recognizing that, the Capital-Star is experimenting with bringing stories to life in different ways. I’m thrilled to be part of the expansion. 
The focus here on connecting people to the power that affects them resonates strongly with me as well. I feel fortunate to be part of an organization committed to delivering fact-based, nuanced, transparent coverage with its audience top-of-mind. 
Thanks for welcoming me to the Pennsylvania Capital-Star team. I am truly excited to be here and can’t wait to share stories with you.

The couple said that hiring aides to help Jim with everyday tasks in light of his cerebral palsy is “damn near impossible.” (Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)Last time Jim Piet, who has cerebral palsy, needed to hire a new personal care assistant to help him complete daily tasks, it took four months.
Amid New Hampshire’s tight labor market and low Medicaid reimbursement rates, people with disabilities, like Piet, face challenges hiring the help they need. And for people with unique needs, this can be difficult, isolating, and exhausting.
‘Damn near impossible’
“I need help for everything,” Piet said.
Piet, who uses a motorized wheelchair, has a personal care assistant, or PCA, to help him get out of bed, shower, and get dressed, and to prepare meals and drive him places. Those everyday services, among others, are paid for through Medicaid.
Piet worked for 29 years, first with the University of New Hampshire’s Institute on Disability, then for New Hampshire’s vocational rehabilitation program as a public relations specialist. He also holds a bachelor’s degree from Southern New Hampshire University and a master’s degree from Springfield College. He lives in Concord with his wife, Pat, who also has cerebral palsy.
“Finding warm bodies is hard,” Pat Piet said. “Finding warm bodies that can actually do the job is nearly impossible.”
Cerebral palsy can manifest differently for different people. For example, Piet uses a wheelchair while his wife doesn’t. For some, cerebral palsy causes developmental delay and intellectual disability. For Piet, it’s just physical. That’s why he hires PCAs as opposed to direct support professionals, or DSPs, another common type of aide who, instead of simply assisting their client with tasks, also guides them, attempts to teach them how to do things for themself, and seeks to assist them with tasks they can’t do for cognitive or developmental reasons. The Piets said there’s a lot of overlap between the two professions.
“A lot of times, especially if we get someone who worked as a DSP, they’re used to being the one who prompts, the one who directs,” Pat Piet said. “They come in to help Jim and Jim’s just throwing out orders one after another. They do not know how to deal with that.”
“Most people are not used to working with someone with a master’s degree,” he added.
They said part of the challenge in finding aides is the job’s difficulty. It requires physical strength to lift clients out of bed, into wheelchairs, and throughout their homes, but Pat Piet noted it also requires “soft skills.”
“I think DSPs and PCAs are some of the most difficult jobs,” she said. “They almost require a degree in psychology. They require you to be able to read people, to be able to prompt someone effectively, to understand Jim is not someone with an intellectual disability, so it’s a different approach.”
Despite this, the jobs pay relatively low wages. Granite State Independent Living, one of the state’s largest agencies hiring DSPs and PCAs, has job postings with wages from $18 to $22 per hour. Those jobs do not require a high school diploma or nursing license.
“You can make almost as much money working retail,” Pat Piet said. “And retail does not require the same amounts of soft skills and emotional and physical investment.”
Jim Piet has two vendors who help him hire his aides: Granite State Independent Living and GT Independence. He said GT Independence pays aides better, but Granite State Independent Living provides better support.
“It’s a double-edged sword,” he said.
He said they often get people incapable of doing the job or who “bring (their) own baggage.” Sometimes caretakers don’t act appropriately when he’s in the community, he said, and treat him like “a charity case.”
“I always cringe when people talk about how emotionally satisfying the job is,” Pat Piet said. “You want to enjoy going to work. You want to get something emotionally out of it. But I feel like when we advertise that, we tend to get people who are emotionally needy and are looking to the person they’re caring for to fill that gap. … This is a job. You get your emotional needs met from friends and family, not at your job.”
They also feel frustrated that people often ask why Pat can’t simply take care of Jim. They note that she has had a career of her own that has required her to go into the office at times he needs help. Jim also said he wants Pat to just be his wife and not rely on her constantly. Still she helps him with his tasks when they absolutely can’t find an aide.
All of these factors make recruiting and retaining good aides “damn near impossible,” Pat Piet said.
Louis Esposito is the executive director of ABLE NH, an advocacy and support group for people with disabilities. He said the struggles the Piets face are common in the disability community.
“They are making below what you would make at Dunkin’ Donuts or Target with the exceptionally high skill level that’s required, and patience that’s needed,” he said. “It’s been very challenging to find anybody.” 
Esposito said he’s heard from people with disabilities that they’ve resorted to paying aides out of pocket to supplement low wages. This presents financial hardship and is only possible for wealthier families.
“If you hire somebody at $14, $15 an hour and they’re there for a couple of years, you want to be able to give them a raise or more income or you lose them,” he said. 
Part of the reason wages are so low for these roles centers around Medicaid reimbursement rates. Medicaid covers this care by reimbursing agencies who provide it. However, the rate at which they reimburse is determined by the state and federal governments and it can vary greatly depending on the type of care provided.
However, Esposito feels it’s more than just financials. He believes the role deserves more respect and “should be treated as a profession.”
“Right now, it’s kind of a job,” he said. “It has to be treated as something more powerful, and it’s not really respected as a long-term profession.”
Esposito formerly worked with Opportunity Networks, which provides services to people with disabilities.
“We would hire and support DSPs,” he said. “They would get trained, you’d put a lot of energy and effort, and they would be fantastic. And then they want to start a family, or they want to proceed with their education. They want to advance. And there’s not a lot of room for growth. So I think until we start respecting this as a field that needs to be given the right respect, I think we’re gonna keep seeing this.”
‘Not up to par’
North Country Independent Living, based in North Conway, operates several homes for people with developmental disabilities and those dealing with the effects of traumatic brain injuries. Patsy Sherry owns and operates the agency with her husband, and they hire DSPs to care for their residents.
“I spend all this money on Indeed,” she said, referring to the job-listing website. “And I’ll schedule interviews, and a lot of times people don’t even show up. They don’t even bother to call to say they’re not coming.”



Gov. Ayotte, the budget, and Medicaid reimbursement rates
Gov. Kelly Ayotte has made services for people with disabilities a key aspect of her agenda during the state’s ongoing budget process. Her budget proposal included $1 billion over two years to ensure there’s no waitlist for anyone trying to receive services for developmental disabilities at facilities like North Country Independent Living or Opportunity Networks.
However, when it became their turn to amend the budget, state lawmakers in the House made significant cuts to that and included a provision that reduced Medicaid reimbursement rates by 3%, which could lower DSP and PCA wages. After public outcry and Ayotte’s urging, the Senate Finance Committee reversed those cuts. Once the full Senate approves its version of the budget, the two chambers will enter committees of conference to hash out the differences between their budgets, including this Medicaid cut. It’s unclear whether the House will agree to reverse this cut during that process.
While she disagreed with the House’s cuts to the reimbursement rate, Ayotte said she doesn’t think a rate increase is on the table for this budget cycle. She said her priority, during this difficult fiscal environment for the state, “was to protect eligibility, to make sure that we don’t have a disability wait list.” She said the current rates are based on a rate study, and said that she wants to reevaluate those rates in the next budget cycle for state fiscal years 2028-29.
“People with disabilities was one of the priorities in my budget,” she said. “And it will continue to be a priority of mine.”



Operating in rural northern New Hampshire means there’s a smaller population to pull from when hiring, she explained. She said they’ve recently increased their starting pay to around $19 an hour. A couple years ago they were paying between $13 and $14 per hour. They now have about 75 employees and are short four full-timers.
“The people that we do get, unfortunately, aren’t — I don’t know how to really say this — they’re not up to par as what we were used to,” she said. “I’m interviewing people that don’t even have GEDs. … Some people that we’ve had come in don’t even have computer skills, and they’re struggling to get through the basic training.”
Fortunately, she has employees who appreciate overtime pay so they help cover gaps left by vacancies. She and the rest of management also step in sometimes.
George Barrett is the associate director at Opportunity Networks, which offers day programming for people with developmental disabilities in Nashua, Bedford, and Amherst. 
“Forty years I’ve been doing this, there’s always been a workforce issue,” Barrett said. “It’s never been as bad as it has been since COVID.”
These challenges, which he also attributed to low pay and the challenging nature of the job, mean they sometimes don’t have the staff to accept new participants, he explained. This means families remain on their waitlist. He noted the majority of their families are middle class, and by not having their loved ones in services, they often must forgo work opportunities to care for them.
“We’ve had staff that have started and have lasted two weeks, and then, due to the demand, have left,” he said, “because they’re seeing the stress and duress that they’re under.”
Barrett said Medicaid comprises nearly 100% of their income, and around 80% of the Medicaid dollars they receive goes directly to staff. In January 2024, when they received a 7% increase, the last time they did, the entirety of that money went to DSPs’ paychecks, he said. Still, that hasn’t kept up with inflation or market changes. He said he’s reached out to state and federal leaders urging them to approve more rate increases, because their current rate — which he called “not even a livable wage” — makes it challenging to compete with other industries for workers.
“In many cases, it’s almost desperation,” he said. “You look at who can you take?”
He said this leads to lower-quality candidates, which “opens the door” for abuse and neglect.
“We haven’t seen that here,” he said. “But, yes, it does. The individuals we work with are, in my opinion, the most vulnerable citizens in the state of New Hampshire. Exploitation is there, because in a lot of cases, they can’t speak up for themselves or defend themselves.”
Barrett called it “a catch-22.”
“You try your best to vet individuals,” he said. “But at the same time, too many vendors are kind of desperate to get staff, to get individuals in service.”
Still, Barrett praised the staff he does have.
“Without them, services like ours do not exist because they do 100% of the work in terms of working with the individuals,” he said. “In essence, individual lives with disabilities are more so in the hands of our direct support professionals. So I can’t give enough credit. And again, I will say they are definitely underpaid.”
While people report struggling to hire DSPs and PCAs nationwide, New Hampshire’s tight labor market makes the problem especially acute. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce ranks New Hampshire as having the most severe worker shortage in the country. As of 2023, the most recent data available, there were only 28 available workers for every 100 open jobs in the state.
Phil Sletten, an economist and research director at the New Hampshire Fiscal Policy Institute, pointed out that the size of the labor force — the number of people working or looking for work — still hasn’t recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2019, the labor force was about 777,300 people, but in 2024 it was roughly 771,600.
“So there has been some labor force recovery from the low point after the pandemic, which was in 2021, but that labor force recovery has not been complete,” Sletten said.
This makes it difficult to hire for any job in New Hampshire. As for DSPs and PCAs specifically, Sletten concurred that low pay was hurting the ability to hire.
As of June 2024, home health and personal care aides — which includes people who take care of anyone, not just those with disabilities — in New Hampshire earn a median hourly wage of $17.27, according to New Hampshire Employment Security. Across all professions, the median wage is $25.01.
“Home health and care aides who may be facing either a financial constraint at home or a more complex environment relative to their own position may be looking for other opportunities,” Sletten said. “And with a higher median wage among all occupations in the state, there may be other opportunities that offer them more compensation.”

‘I can’t change the world if I can’t get out of bed’
Kathy Bates, who lives in her own house in Somersworth and has cerebral palsy, is another who struggles to hire DSPs, which are vital to her day-to-day life.
“Without them, I couldn’t work,” Bates said. “I couldn’t even get out of bed.”
Bates has DSPs come help her a few times a day. They come in the morning to help her get out of bed, shower, dress, get into her wheelchair, and do other tasks. They come again in the afternoon and at night as well. They keep her “connected to the community” by allowing her to get out of her house.
“I really couldn’t live a good life without them,” she said. “I’m not saying I need help with everything, but I need to get out of bed, I need to get my day started before I can make anything happen.”
Bates arranges to hire these aides herself, which takes a long time. She often has people call out sick at the last minute, she said, and has to find coverage when they want to take time off. She keeps a list on her bedside table with names of people to contact if someone calls out the morning of.
“Managing personal care is a full-time job sometimes,” she said. “You want to be a good boss, but I have to bug people. I don’t like bugging people.”
She said this inconsistency means many people with disabilities are afraid to get jobs because they worry they won’t be able to get out of bed every day and have someone to drive them to work.
“There’s this huge untapped workforce out there,” she said.
Bates has a few methods of hiring aides. Sometimes she puts ads on Craig’s List. Sometimes she uses agencies like Granite State Independent Living and GT Independence.
“Coming through the door is like 50% of the interview,” she said.
She often sets up interviews and they never show up. Additionally, many of the candidates who inquire are elderly, which is a problem because it’s a physically demanding job. After someone is hired, there’s a weekslong process of paperwork for Medicaid, background checks, and other administration. Still, she’s grateful for her aides.
“I’m glad I do have the women that work for me,” she said. “I’m really glad that they’re as flexible as they are.”
Bates is also active in advocacy within the disability community. She grew up before the Americans with Disabilities Act, so she remembers what it was like to have a disability before ADA protections, and she wants to continue making the world a better place for people with disabilities. To do so, she leads trainings for medical professionals about working with people with disabilities at the UNH Institute on Disability. She also writes a blog on disability called “From Where I Sit.” And she’s an accessibility and inclusion specialist on the Self Advocacy Leadership Team, a task force within the New Hampshire Council on Developmental Disabilities that seeks to find solutions for problems facing the disability community.
The work gives Bates a lot of joy and fulfillment. She emphasized how none of it is possible without her caretakers.

There are many things that state leaders should do these days to improve the UNC System. Providing adequate funds to hire and retain topflight faculty and reining in out-of-control professional sports programs would be a good start.
Unfortunately, at present, the emphasis in Raleigh is on advancing a right-wing political agenda, and so it is that state House Republicans have approved a bill to give a local far right propaganda outfit — a group founded by conservative financier and activist Art Pope known as the Martin Center for Academic Renewal — a role in crafting university admissions policies.
And it’s hard to overstate just how big a mistake this is. For more than 25 years, the Martin Center has spewed a steady stream of far right attacks on almost all of the best aspects of modern higher education in an effort to turn back the clock on progress.
The bottom line: As is the case in so many areas of higher education, lawmakers should leave admissions to the professionals and tell conservative advocacy groups to stay in their own lane.

For years, states have taxed hospitals and other health care providers to draw down federal matching funds and help finance their Medicaid programs. Now, states may lose their ability to raise or implement new taxes. (Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)The tax and spending bill the U.S. House approved last week targets a strategy states have used to boost the Medicaid dollars they get from the federal government. The measure would cap or freeze the taxes states levy on medical providers, potentially leaving states with major holes in their Medicaid budgets.
As a result, states would face the choice of either replacing the lost federal money with state dollars, scaling back services or providing coverage to fewer people.
Medicaid is a joint state-federal program, primarily for people with low incomes. For the traditional Medicaid population — children and their caregivers, people with disabilities and pregnant women — the federal government matches state Medicaid spending on a sliding scale, ranging from 50% for the wealthiest states to 77% for the poorest ones.
Consider a state that gets half of its Medicaid funding from the federal government. If that state collects $100 million by taxing providers, it can use $50 million of the revenue to draw down $50 million in federal matching funds, which it can use to expand Medicaid coverage to more people. Then it can take the remaining $50 million in revenue and use that money to draw down $50 million in federal dollars to pay providers more for caring for Medicaid patients.
Children’s health services could see trims even under scaled-back Medicaid cuts

Forty-nine states — all but Alaska — use the strategy. In 2018, the most recent year for which data is available, states relied on provider taxes to fund 17% of their Medicaid spending, up from 7% in 2008, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office.
As part of their effort to cut federal Medicaid spending by roughly $625 billion over the next decade, House Republicans have proposed capping the state provider taxes and freezing them in place, preventing states from raising them or implementing new ones in response to inflation. Under current law, states can levy taxes of up to 6% on tax providers’ net revenue. The GOP measure also would add work requirements for Medicaid recipients, a step that would save money by reducing the rolls.
A report from the Congressional Budget Office, the bipartisan research arm of Congress, says eliminating the taxes entirely could save the federal government hundreds of billions of dollars over the next decade.
Many conservatives say the taxes are an accounting trick that allows states to draw down money from the federal government without having to front their true share of the Medicaid program. Some have even called the provider taxes a “money laundering” scheme.
“States are gaming the system — creating complex tax schemes that shift their responsibility to invest in Medicaid and rob federal taxpayers,” Dr. Mehmet Oz, the administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, said in a May 12 news release.
Brian Blase, president of the Paragon Health Institute, a conservative policy group that is working with Republicans to formulate Medicaid cuts, described provider taxes as “a way that states and providers can rip off the federal government.”
“States need to have some accountability for the spending in their programs,” Blase said.
States that enshrined Medicaid expansion in their constitutions could be in a bind

But advocates of these taxes, including state Medicaid directors and even the hospitals that pay the taxes, describe them as legal and legitimate financial tools that have helped providers cover essential services and states fund their Medicaid programs for years. The result of eliminating these taxes or freezing them, they say, will be hospital closures and service cuts.
“We don’t like to pay these taxes, but the alternative is resources or access to care aren’t there for that community,” said Jason Pray, vice president of legislative affairs at America’s Essential Hospitals, an association representing about 350 hospitals. “The state would more than likely have to then tax individuals to make up for that, to keep the services at the same level and keep the resources at the same level.”
Blase said the provider taxes allow hospitals to make windfall profits from the additional federal matching funds that flow back to them, representing a type of “corporate welfare.”
But Pray said often hospitals in his association are losing money. By allowing states to boost payments to hospitals and other providers that serve Medicaid patients, he said, the tax enables hospitals to stay open in the long run, not garner a windfall.
Pray also noted that in the past, support for the taxes has been bipartisan.
“Republicans for years have shown they support provider taxes and have understood the value of them,” he said.

Edwin Park, a research professor at the Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy, pointed out that some hospitals pay the tax and don’t get much back, because they serve few Medicaid patients. The hospitals that benefit most are the so-called safety net hospitals that do care for many low-income patients, he said.
Park said he is worried that once the strategy is off the table, states will have to cut their Medicaid spending to balance their budgets.
Jay Ludlam, deputy secretary for North Carolina Medicaid, is worried about that, too. In North Carolina, Ludlam said, almost all of the tax revenue the state collects from providers helps pay for Medicaid services.
“The money goes to providers when they provide services. It’s not special. It’s just another way that states tax themselves and put money into the program,” Ludlam told Stateline. “If it means that there’s going to be less money in Medicaid … we’ll have to cut eligibility, cut benefits, cut provider rates, in order to maintain the program.”

The news comes after years of state officials spending billions on economic growth programs tilted heavily toward the wealthy.
It might seem ironic, but Ohio’s economy added jobs in April even as unemployment continued to grow. That’s because job growth isn’t keeping up with the numbers joining the workforce. And there are reasons to believe that things will get worse, according to the think tank Policy Matters Ohio.
Data released last week by the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services estimated that the state added 22,200 jobs in April. But statewide unemployment rose for the fifth consecutive month, to 4.9%. That’s the sixth-highest of any state, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Heather Smith, a researcher at Policy Matters Ohio, said the new state data raise some questions.
“The civilian labor force has increased at about the same rate as the number of unemployed workers, suggesting that while more Ohioans are entering the job market, they are not all securing employment,” she said in a written statement. “This raises questions around the reported increases in jobs across service-providing industries – why aren’t Ohioans getting hired?”
The Department of Job and Family Services conducts a monthly survey, releases its estimate of the number of new jobs, and then often revises it downward. For example, it initially estimated that 7,500 jobs were created in March, and then cut that number to 5,200.
Of the jobs thought to be created in April, the great majority were in the service sector, 18,800. More than 6,500 of those were in hospitality as those businesses staff up for summer.
Construction and manufacturing added 1,200 and 1,100 jobs, respectively, while the number of government jobs increased by 1,300.
A separate household survey indicated that 15,000 joined the Ohio job market in April. But only 6,000 found jobs while the rest were unemployed.
“Legislators ought to pay attention to the growing unemployment rate, given its steady increase over the last five months,” Smith said. “The last time we saw the unemployment rate in Ohio decrease was between September and October – prior to the November election.”
Ohio’s economy has lagged for more than a decade after the creation of billion-dollar programs mostly benefitting the well off on the promise that they would create jobs for average Ohioans.
Created in 2013 under the auspices of then-Gov. John Kasich, the LLC tax loophole costs about $1 billion a year. 
It was sold as a way to boost small business. But an analysis showed that hiring in that sector has fallen relative to other states, while the wealthiest 7% are claiming nearly 40% of the benefit.
Started around the same time, JobsOhio is funded through a state liquor franchise that used to flow into state coffers. Its well-paid staff has grown rapidly as it has doled out more than $1 billion in incentives to businesses. But it hasn’t proven that those incentives have created any jobs. 
Controversial ‘private corporation’ JobsOhio gets billions more without paying more to state

Even so, the Ohio Controlling Board in February extended JobsOhio’s control of the state liquor franchise to 2053. The “private” corporation paid the state $1.41 billion for its initial lease of the franchise. But the state didn’t require an additional penny to extend it another 15 years.
Meanwhile, Smith of Policy Matters Ohio warned that several developments at the federal level could further drag down the Ohio job market.
“A recent survey of Fourth District businesses by the Federal Reserve of Cleveland found that 22% of respondents anticipated the tariffs would force them to decrease their staff,” she wrote. “This is already underway: Several large employers across the state have submitted mass layoff notices, including 744 manufacturing jobs in Fremont. A Chillicothe paper plant, which was set to layoff 826 union workers by the end of June, agreed to remain open until December. While this buys impacted Ohioans a bit more time, the plant closing will be a devastating hit to workers in the area.”
In addition to potential harm from tariffs, the Trump administration is trying to cut hundreds of thousands of federal jobs and to slash services as it tries to fund further tax cuts.
“Ohio policymakers need to hold their federal counterparts accountable for the impact of funding cuts on the state and stop preemptively cutting critical public services with trigger language in the state budget,” Smith said. “If federal budget hawks get their way and force the state to pick up a greater share of the Medicaid budget, proposed trigger language could cut off the health insurance of 770,000 Ohioans.”

(Photo by Sean Rayford/Getty Images)A North Carolina-based firm that submitted a bid to manage the state’s Hurricane Helene homebuilding program is alleging that its proposal was improperly disqualified.
IEM International, which is based in Morrisville, said in a statement to NC Newsline that it had filed a complaint with the NC Department of Commerce, which oversaw the contract process. And the firm is seeking to have the critical contract re-bid.
“The decision to disqualify IEM’s compliant proposal without review or scoring is highly irregular and concerning,” the firm said in its statement.
The NC Department of Commerce did not respond to a request for comment sent Friday.
State officials awarded the contract earlier this month to Horne LLP, a Mississippi-based company, for $81.5 million. The firm is charged with implementing a $1.4 billion federal housing grant and overseeing multiple construction contractors to rebuild from the deadliest storm in state history.
Horne’s selection has already drawn scrutiny from state lawmakers after the firm’s previous contract, part of a troubled rebuild process in eastern North Carolina, was not renewed.
IEM was one of four other bidders on the state’s solicitation for Helene. But its bid was deemed “non-responsive” due to inadequate financial information, according to state officials and documents.
“The vendor did not submit required financial documentation, and per DCR’s legal analysis, it was deemed non-responsive,” according to a memo from the department. That same memo shows that IEM’s bid was not formally graded.
IEM said in their statement that the firm “approached this (solicitation) with the seriousness it deserves,” and had provided “three years of audited financial data.”
A copy of IEM’s full offer, obtained by NC Newsline through public records request, includes a page that details the firm’s balance sheet, income statement and cash flow data from three fiscal years.
The firm checked “yes” when asked if the financial figures were based on audited statements. Under a section of the bid asking for a link to annual reports, the firm wrote: “As a privately owned company, IEM’s financial statements are not public. IEM can provide to DCR upon request.”
Financial details for Horne, whose bid was awarded and also obtained through public records, were redacted. The firm appears to have included pages of consolidated financial statements from 2022 and 2021 in an appendix to its bid.
Stephanie McGarrah, who leads the Department of Commerce division tasked with Helene recovery, told lawmakers on Thursday that she was “personally very disappointed” about the result of IEM’s bid.
“There are very few vendors in this space, and they had partners we were familiar with,” McGarrah said.
And asked if she would re-bid the contract with the knowledge of a recent settlement agreement by Horne, McGarrah said she would not.
“I do think we made the right decision,” she said.
IEM’s proposed partners included Deloitte, Fahe, and Tetra Tech, according to the bid. And the firm had proposed tapping multiple partners based locally in western North Carolina: B-K Construction and Brucemont Communications.
According to North Carolina’s administrative rules, a bidder can submit a protest within 30 days of an award being granted, detailing their reasoning and supporting documents.
That protest is received by the “executive officer” for the department that made the purchase — in this case, Commerce. That official can determine the protest is “meritless” and refuse a protest meeting within 10 days.
If the protest meeting is granted, it will be scheduled within 30 days of the bidder’s request.
Details of the decision, regardless of outcome, are sent to the state purchasing officer, David O’Neal.
IEM, which has contracts globally, has worked with the state before. The firm won a bid in 2018, after Hurricane Matthew.
Three years later, it sued ReBuild NC, the troubled office that oversaw hurricane recovery in eastern North Carolina, for failing to pay related to contract work. That case was settled outside of court.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-27 09:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Spending cap will temper big investments in next CT budget,Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/27/ct-budget-modest-investments/,Will CT Democrats accept a budget that makes far more modest investments in health care and social services than they promised?,"Gov. Ned Lamont and legislative leaders cleared a big hurdle last week on their way to adopting a new state budget when they compromised on the spending cap.
Another key obstacle was removed Friday when the administration struck a last-minute deal to avert strikes at 51 nursing homes and 193 group homes for clients with developmental disabilities.
But with nine days remaining in the regular 2025 session, one challenge remains. 
Will rank-and-file Democrats in House and Senate majorities accept a new two-year state budget that makes far more modest investments in health care, social services and special education than they promised to deliver just a few months ago?
And if so, how will they explain that as Connecticut wraps this fiscal year in five weeks with the second-largest surplus in state history — its eighth consecutive robust finish?
“I’d be surprised if we didn’t have [a budget deal] done in the next couple of days,” House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, said Monday, adding that he expects the “vast majority” of Democratic legislators will support what leaders negotiate with the Lamont administration. “You might get a few people who can’t get there.”
Those who fall into that last category likely are those with good memories.
Legislators asked to temper increases for Medicaid, social services
Democratic leaders pledged Jan. 28 at the Capitol to dramatically increase the state’s Medicaid payments to providers who treat the poor, a rate schedule that hasn’t been revised comprehensively since 2007. Critics say thousands of low-income residents effectively are uninsured or underinsured, unable to find physicians willing to treat them.
A 2019 analysis by KFF, the health care think-tank formerly known as Kaiser Family Foundation, found that Connecticut’s Medicaid rates for most specialists ranked 42nd among all states while those paid to primary care doctors ranked 22nd.
Democrats pledged to boost rates roughly 75% by increasing annual funding by $250 million over four years, beginning with a $75 million infusion in 2026.
Ritter didn’t provide full details of ongoing budget talks but confirmed that target would be scaled back considerably.
The compromise on Medicaid funding “is probably the one that is most disappointing,” said the speaker, who noted that for every $1 in spending Connecticut cuts in this area, it loses roughly 50 cents in federal reimbursement. “We’re just leaving money on the table.”
That’s because while Lamont recently agreed to exceed the constitutional spending cap, which keeps budget growth in line with household income and inflation, this fiscal year, normal cap limits come back in force in the coming biennium.
The cap creates a similar challenge for those legislators worried about the private nonprofit agencies that deliver the bulk of state-sponsored services to clients with developmental disabilities, mental health and addiction issues, and those re-entering society after incarceration.
The industry, which misses out on hundreds of millions annually through state payments that haven’t matched inflation for decades, asked for a $264 million increase next fiscal year and another $237 million on top of that in 2026-27.
Legislative leaders won’t come close to those numbers in the final budget.
Ritter said it should hold funding flat in the first year and add about $76 million in 2026-27.
The industry also will get more funds because Lamont struck a deal Friday to avert strikes at nursing homes and group homes. That agreement calls for the state to spend $149 million over the next two fiscal years combined on social service agencies running group homes, according to SEIU 1199 NE, the state’s largest health care workers’ union. 
But those funds would be dedicated only to employees’ wages and benefits and only for nonprofits serving clients with developmental disabilities.
Will rank-and-file lawmakers accept these more modest investments in Medicaid and social services?
Rep. Jillian Gilchrest, D-West Hartford, co-chairwoman of the Human Services Committee and one of the leaders who pitched the big Medicaid investment in late January, said it will hinge on the final budget totals leaders negotiate with Lamont. In other words, will the proposed funding still be enough to make a difference?
“I don’t think the caucus will accept an austere … Medicaid increase or nonprofit increase,” she said, adding that it’s hard to accept in this era of big budget surpluses.
Since resetting its budget caps in 2017, Connecticut has closed the last seven fiscal years with an average surplus of $1.8 billion, which represents 8% of the General Fund. That cushion is even larger considering about three-quarters of the budget involves wages, benefits, Medicaid, debt service and other fixed costs.
This year’s projected surplus approaches $2.4 billion or 10% of the General Fund. And analysts estimate the state will continue to save more than $1 billion annually through at least 2028.
The state has been using those funds to accelerate paying down a huge pension debt amassed between 1939 and 2010. But increasing numbers of legislators are questioning whether one generation is being overburdened to solve a problem created by three.
Sen. Cathy Osten, D-Sprague, co-chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee, also finds it hard to accept Connecticut can’t afford to do more to help vulnerable residents. 
She declined to predict how rank-and-file legislators would embrace the final, negotiated budget but said many of her colleagues are ready to invest more in Medicaid and social services.
“They have been some of the top topics that people are concerned about,” she said, adding that special education falls into that category as well.
More funding for K-12 schools, no ECS cuts
A special education funding crisis in local schools sparked legislators from both parties to defy Lamont earlier this year and approve an extra $40 million for K-12 districts, despite warnings from the governor this would push current finances over a cap that keeps budget growth in line with household income and inflation.
Legislators and Lamont ultimately compromised and used an accounting gimmick that first moved the $40 million for special education outside of the formal budget — and the spending cap system — and then transferred funds to K-12 districts. 
The Appropriations Committee in late April recommended continuing that $40 million in extra funding — and adding another $84 million — in each of the next two fiscal years.
Ritter said leaders will maintain the $40 million increase approved this year but can add only about $35 million to it because of the cap.
At the same time, however, the new budget is expected to add roughly $26 million over the coming biennium to ensure no K-12 school districts receives less Education Cost Sharing funding. The ECS program offers the state’s chief operating grant for municipal school districts.
Ritter predicted that city and town leaders in general would be pleased with the municipal aid package lawmakers were able to negotiate with the governor.
Lamont, a fiscal moderate who has called the spending cap “sacrosanct,” repeatedly has urged lawmakers to embrace budget caps to avoid the huge deficits and large tax hikes that dominated the 2010s.
Connecticut, which still has more than $35 billion in unfunded pension liabilities, has dedicated about $8.6 billion toward reducing pension debt since 2020.
“We appreciate the legislature being collaborative throughout the budget process in the closing weeks of the session,” the governor’s communications director, Rob Blanchard, said Monday. “The governor looks forward to signing an honestly balanced budget that makes smart investments in the future without raising taxes.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/IMG_0399.jpg,,,2025-05-27 06:09:15.769660

A bill that would require the Chancellor of Higher Education to create the Hunger-Free Campus Grant Program had supporter testimony last week in the Ohio House Workforce and Higher Education Committee meeting.

The program would award hunger-free campus grants which could, for example, create an on-campus food pantry or a partnership with a local bank, provide students information about SNAP, have an emergency assistance grant available to students, or have a student meal plan credit donation program.
Ohio House Reps. Sean Patrick Brennan, D-Parma, and Jim Hoops, R-Napoleon, introduced Ohio House Bill 157, which had 15 people submit supporter testimony. H.B. 157 would appropriate $625,000 for fiscal year 2026 and 2027 for the program. 
“The Hunger Free Campus Act would incentivize colleges and universities to establish basic needs programs, like an on-site food pantry or emergency assistance grant program as well as connecting students to resources,” said Sarah Kuhns, external affairs manager of the Ohio Association of Foodbanks.  
The Ohio Association of Foodbanks has worked with more than 30 Ohio colleges and universities to create food pantries or distribute food to students struggling with food insecurity, she said. 
“Throughout our network’s engagement on the issue of college student hunger, it has been clear that the approach has been patchwork, leading institutions to establish basic needs programs only if they have the connections, the will and the funds to do so,” Kuhns said. 
Students who are unable to meet their basic needs are more likely to have a hard time in class, take longer to finish their degree or drop out, Kuhns said. 
Some food pantries on Ohio’s college campuses said they are interested in providing microwaves and stoves near the pantry, so commuter students or those with limited access to a kitchen can cook the items they receive from the pantry, she said. 
State Rep. Tom Young, R-Washington Twp., was surprised that food insecurity on college campuses is an issue. 
“I don’t have anyone coming up and saying, ‘We have students starving on campus and things like that.’ I just can’t get my head around it,” he said. “Why is this such a big issue that no one knows anything about?” 
In response, Kuhns said food insecurity is often an invisible problem. 
About 23% of college students experienced food insecurity in 2020 and 59% of food-insecure students potentially eligible for SNAP did not report receiving benefits, according to a report released last summer by the U.S. Government Accountability Office.
State Rep. Tracy Richardson, R-Marysville, asked what population of students are experiencing food insecurity and Kuhns said this affects all demographics of students — commuter, non-traditional, and those living on campus. 
Deacon Nick Bates, director of the Hunger Network in Ohio, said he regularly hears from campus ministries about the growing need to help food insecure students across Ohio. 
“Students cannot learn hungry,” Bates said. “Food insecurity on college campuses leads to lower GPA’s and lower completion rates.” 
Sophie Gephardt, a graduate social work student at Ohio State University, talked to students facing food insecurity last year when she did her undergraduate thesis on food insecurity experiences of Ohio State social worker students. 
“Some common themes included poor diet quality impacting energy and health, concerns about rising food costs, and overall constant stress and mental health concerns due to food insecurity,” she said. “The Enact the Hunger-Free Campus Act would be incredibly beneficial to getting students connected to resources that they so desperately need.”
Meeting students’ basic needs leads to higher retention and graduation rates, said Stephanie Dodd, executive director at Community Campus Coalition. 
“These outcomes contribute directly to Ohio’s workforce development priorities and long-term economic growth,” she said.

(Photo by Graham Stokes for Ohio Capital Journal. Republish photo only with original story.)Republican leaders in Columbus are floating the idea of attempting to make it more difficult to amend the state constitution, a proposal that was defeated in 2023 by Ohioans across the political spectrum.
Issue 1, decided on Aug. 8, 2023, sent a bipartisan message, say those who worked against its passage.
“Ohioans of all walks of life — Democrat, Republican, independent, labor, business, rural, urban — said, ‘Why are you doing this?'” said union leader and president of AFL-CIO Tim Burga after the election.
Issue 1 would have taken away majority rule in Ohio. The proposed constitutional amendment would have raised the threshold for constitutional amendments to pass from 50%+1, a simple majority, to 60%. It was defeated 57-43%.
But some Republican leaders have floated a rerun, saying special interest groups have been pushing their agendas, and constitutional amendment proposals have gotten out of control.
“A warning that I had a few years ago; we’re going to see a real uptick, I believe, in, people attempting to legislate by constitutional amendment,” Secretary of State Frank LaRose said during a ballot board meeting this May.
LaRose recently raised red flags about two new issues collecting signatures to get on the ballot: one to abolish property taxes and another to end qualified immunity, protecting police and other government agencies from lawsuits.
“That’s not a great way to govern a state, and [I think] that legislation should be done by the legislature,” LaRose said. “I think that’s something to be discussed in this building going forward.”
House Speaker Matt Huffman, R-Lima, wants to change the rule, too — having said for years that it’s too easy to change state law.
“Good government folks want it raised to 60%,” he said in early May. “I think that it should be.”
Ohio Education Association President Scott DiMauro was one of the leading voices against raising the threshold back in 2023.
“When the people of Ohio are confronted with a choice, either protect your freedom and your ability to exercise your rights in our democracy or give more power to power hungry, corrupt politicians — the people of Ohio are going to say, ‘We want to have the freedom to choose our destiny,'” DiMauro told WEWS on Friday.
People deserve a voice, DiMauro said.
“It’s from people that are just frustrated that they believe that their elected representatives and senators in Columbus just are simply unresponsive to their needs and interests,” he said. “People will take matters into their own hands.”
Putting the question back on the ballot would have the same result, he said.
Huffman acknowledged this, saying that it would be an uphill battle and unpopular.
“Short of everybody steps back and says, ‘We really should raise the limit,’ which I don’t see that happening,” he said. “I don’t think that’s a reality.”
Some lawmakers, like state Rep. Thomas Hall, R-Madison Township, still think it’s a good idea to try again.
Former Speaker Jason Stephens, R-Kitts Hill, disagreed.
“First and foremost, the Legislature works for the people,” he said in a text. “Changing the current method of holding the legislature accountable when it acts (or does not act) would require consensus across the political spectrum as to what those rules should be… Recent history has shown the effort will not be successful.”
Said DiMauro, “The people have spoken, and they spoke pretty loudly and pretty clearly. I wish they would start listening to the people.”

(Illustration by tolgart/Getty Images)ChatGPT has taken a couple of steps closer toward becoming a Kansas Reflector opinion columnist.
The last time I asked the artificial intelligence chatbot to write a column about Kansas politics, in December 2022, it couldn’t connect to current articles online. ChatGPT produced a generic and inoffensive piece: “There is much more to Kansas than meets the eye,” and so on.
When I asked it to write about the 2025 state legislative session on Monday, a better column resulted, citing both current events and web sources (including the Reflector).
 “Advocates must continue to push for increased education funding, expanded health care access, and the protection of civil rights,” it pontificated.

Yet something was still missing.
In the two-and-a-half years between those two columns, the AI sector has exploded. New models have made their debuts, and big tech has sunk billions of dollars into making them smarter than ever. Yet the promise that I once wrote about has been replaced — for me — by a nagging sense that AI still falls woefully short and poses profound risks for the globe. The problem of hallucinations has not only persisted, but grown worse. Too few people have given serious through to where we’re all headed.
No one invests in these large language models to create robotic columnists. Yet the job of synthesizing current events and adding context or perspective would seem well suited to artificial intelligence. For good or ill (probably good, given my hope to remain employed), ChatGPT has shown little improvement in writing memorable prose. Its sentences read like so much baby food, mushed and mushed again into a smooth paste.
The code underlying this current brand of AI offers an explanation. These “large language models” train on text generated by human beings and generate responses based on probability. Words follow other words thanks to statistical calculation. The addition of real-time web searching improves the experience, but blandness persists.
These models can be more interesting to read about than use. For example, researchers don’t entirely understand why current AI technology works at all.
Perhaps that’s why computer gurus hold AI in such reverence. The rest of us, though, deal with its real-world shortcomings. Last year, I wrote about a particularly gnarly hallucination in which ChatGPT insisted that my last name — created by my husband and I in 2010 — had deep historical origins. Those lies irritated me, and I wrote a column venting my frustration.
These days, an identical query results in a much smarter response. The bot refers to my piece, for one thing.
This kind of improvement can’t be denied. Yet it only happened because a human being noticed the mistake and fussed about it. If I had not noticed, if I had not written the column, there was no reason to expect that the model would improve. And this points to the fundamental, continuing limitation of large language models: They only know what they’ve been taught and can infer from such data. They can’t imagine, create or desire new experiences. They only reflect what has gone before.
At the same time, I wouldn’t grow too comfortable. A growing cadre of scientists warn that AI could lead to devastating outcomes — and not from boredom. They believe that if current technology leads to the creation of artificial superintelligence, humanity itself might go extinct. A forthcoming book on the subject bears the comforting title “If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies.”
I could go into the existential risk arguments at length, but for convenience’s sake I’ll summarize.
If you create something much more intelligent than you, it could decide that its own goals differ from yours.  If you stand in its way, that something might decide to remove you. In other words, Frankenstein’s monster might decide to depose Dr. Frankenstein.
That’s it.
While you might consider such a situation far-fetched, the world only has to end once. There could well be multiple super-intelligent AIs in years to come, with different creators and goals and personalities. Can we be sure that every one of them has our best interests at heart?
For that matter, I don’t think the risk comes exclusively from super-intelligent systems. Just hook up a garden-variety AI to the military assets of any reasonable-sized country. Presto! Instantaneous instability. Again, this might seem far-fetched to most of us. But can you guarantee that every single country will refrain from such a step?
The risks seem real enough to merit attention from governments and everyday folks. Better safe than sorry, as the saying goes.
Yet I’m not much worried about the current-generation large language models, of the type that fuel ChatGPT or Google’s Gemini or Elon Musk’s Grok. I have watched this technology develop over the past couple of years with a skeptical eye. It can take decent notes from an audio recording. It can help high schoolers and college students cheat on tests. It has made many aspects of software coding faster and more efficient.
That all makes sense. It could do the same things back in 2022, to a lesser extent. Meanwhile, customers sigh as poorly integrated “AI” features spam their search engines and cell phones. Immense power requirements gobble up grid capacity and spew pollution.
Where are the breakthroughs? What happened to the hypothesized medical discoveries? Where are the penetrating insights from virtual Kansas Reflector columnists? Could it be that large language models, as we currently experience them, only go so far and work well in limited circumstances? Could it be that the furor we’ve experienced stems mostly from marketing hype and the wishful thinking of tech bros?
I’m not sure. But I’m suspicious.

Like many moderate-income workers, public school teachers Julia and Scott Whitnall didn’t think they’d become homeowners in their early 30s. Especially in California.
“We never felt homeownership was in our cards. But we did it!” Julia Whitnall said. “We’re extremely happy.”
The couple moved May 16 to a $509,000 two-bedroom house in Ripon, east of San Francisco in the Central Valley region.
It wasn’t easy. Despite a relatively high combined income of $140,000 from their nearby jobs, they had to compromise on size and take on extra work at summer camps to pull it off. Then they had to exercise patience as the sellers struggled to find a new home.
High interest rates and high prices in a still-competitive housing market continue to make it tough for first-time buyers, even those with good but moderate incomes.
The number of new apartments is at a 50-year high, but states expect a slowdown

On a national level, households making $75,000 to $100,000 — typical of teachers, nurses and skilled trades workers in many states — face a daunting lack of homes they can afford. That’s according to new research by the National Association of Realtors and Realtor.com based on listings in March of this year compared with 2024. However, the numbers showed an encouraging 20% increase in homes for sale, affordable or not.
Despite more houses for sale, those moderate-income buyers — which the report called “middle- and upper-middle-income buyers” — are much more hard-pressed to find an affordable home than they were in 2019, when almost half the homes on the market were affordable to them. This year they can afford only 21.2% of homes on the market — a slight improvement compared with 20.8% in 2024, according to the report.
It also found that a few states are improving in affordability for people in the $75,000-to-$100,000 income range. But many states are not.
The largest affordability gaps are in California, Hawaii, Idaho, Massachusetts and Montana, where such households can afford fewer than 12% of houses on the market. By contrast, they could afford about half the houses for sale in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Ohio and West Virginia.
There’s progress in states that are adding more housing at moderate price points: Arizona, Colorado, Delaware, Florida and Utah, according to the Realtors report.
 Balanced markets

Nationwide, to get home markets back in line with moderate-income families, the United States needs 416,000 more homes for sale at or below $255,000, according to the report.
“In many places, we’re still seeing a huge mismatch between income levels and what’s available to buy for moderate-income families,” said Nadia Evangelou, the National Association of Realtors’ senior economist and director of real estate research.
“We are no longer in crisis mode, but we are still very far from where we need to be. We can’t fix it overnight. It will take years,” Evangelou said.

Heather, who asked not to share her last name for privacy reasons, said she can’t even think of buying a house near her job on Long Island, New York. She makes more than $100,000 as a registered nurse and her family makes $170,000 with her husband’s job in building maintenance. But $4,400 in rent and $2,000 in monthly day care costs for three children have them living paycheck to paycheck.
“We can’t even afford a small car repair, let alone a mortgage in our hometown” of Ronkonkoma in Suffolk County, Heather said. Their jobs exposed her and her husband to risks in the pandemic that her neighbors avoided with remote work, she said. But she now feels like she’s in worse shape financially than she was in 2019 and considers moving away.

“We happened to hit the market at the right time in 2025,” Ashley Jonas said. “We bid on this house just as [President Donald] Trump was announcing tariffs. I think a lot of people were holding their coin purses. We weren’t.”
 Help for teachers

Teachers, who generally make less than nurses or trades workers, are particularly squeezed. Some states, facing teacher shortages in local schools, are working to raise pay. And increasingly, some schools and hospitals are providing housing to lure more teachers and nurses.
“We lose so many teachers because they can’t find housing here,” said Autumn Rivera, a 20-year teaching veteran and 2022 Colorado Teacher of the Year. Despite her experience and credentials, Rivera said she can’t contemplate buying even a townhouse in the rural resort town of Glenwood Springs, where she teaches.
Fast-building states get more babies

Prices for those townhouses now start in the $700,000 range, more than twice what they were when she last considered buying in 2019. Rivera feels lucky to have a reasonable rent by sharing a home with its owner, but many teachers in her Roaring Fork Schools need the 117 apartments provided by the district with affordable rent, she said. The district hopes the apartments will allow teachers to save up for a home; it has also built 14 houses for staff with Habitat for Humanity and Holy Cross Energy.
One way to make homebuying more feasible for teachers is to pay them more — a strategy that paid off for New Mexico, one of the few bright spots in a different report on teachers’ inability to afford housing, which was published this month by the National Council on Teacher Quality, a research and advocacy group.
Beginning teachers in Albuquerque saw a 60% increase in pay between 2019 and 2025, which fell just short of a 65% jump in home prices, according to the report. The report credited a state law that raised teacher salaries, including starting pay, by $10,000.
“We’re dealing with the issue of teachers being able to live in the communities where they’re actually working,” said state Rep. Joy Garratt, a Democrat who sponsored a new law, signed in April, that sets higher minimum salaries for teachers effective July 1.
Detroit schools also gave teachers with advanced degrees a pay boost of up to 50% since 2019, about the same increase as home prices, according to the report from the National Council on Teacher Quality. Albuquerque and Detroit are on the report’s list of most affordable places for beginning teachers to live.
But nationally, on average, experienced teachers who started in 2019 are less able to afford a home now than when they began, according to the report.
“Teacher pay has gone up 24% in the last five years, which some might say is solid growth, and yet the increase in house for purchase has gone up 47%,” said Heather Peske, the organization’s president.
“Housing prices are critical to being able to attract and keep great teachers,” Peske said. “People will be leaving the profession trying to find something that pays enough for housing. And bottom line, kids won’t get as good an education.”

The five-member utility regulator is set to vote July 15 as the state’s largest utility expects to spend billions of dollars to meet skyrocketing energy demands attributed to new electricity-hogging data centers. Georgia Power’s 2025 Integrated Resource Plan calls for renewable energy but also more fossil fuels.
Georgia Power has come under fire after PSC hearings in April when the company disclosed it is considering building new methane gas units to generate up to 9,000 more megawatts of capacity by 2031.
A number of environmental groups are calling on the utility to include a more diverse mix of clean, affordable energy solutions like solar power in its long-range plan instead of relying more heavily on fossil fuels.
Georgia Power’s plans include upgrading the nuclear units at Plant Hatch and Plant Vogtle and the oil and gas-fired units at Plant McIntosh.
In addition, the company plans to upgrade nine hydroelectric dams throughout the state and build new transmission lines along more than 1,000 miles of power lines.
Georgia Power’s plans also include the addition of 1,100 MW of renewable energy from solar and battery storage.
“The 2025 IRP provides a comprehensive plan to support Georgia’s continued economic growth and allow us to serve Georgians with clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy well into the future – we look forward to continuing the process through the hearings this week,” Georgia Power spokesman Matthew Kent said.
Three days of hearings about the plan will begin Tuesday, following a proposed agreement reached between Georgia Power and the PSC to freeze base electric rates from 2026 to 2028. Some critics have argued that the proposed agreement is a political maneuver to protect Republican incumbent commissioners Fitz Johnson and Tim Echols. The PSC members are facing voters for the first time in years after a lawsuit delayed the usual six-year election cycle.
Since 2023, the average Georgia Power residential ratepayer is paying $43 more per month due to rising base electric rates, higher natural gas costs and the completion of two nuclear reactors at Plant Vogtle.
In April, the Environmental Protection Agency approved a two-year exemption at the request of Georgia Power’s parent Southern Company allowing Plant Bowen and Plant Scherer to bypass federal emission regulations for mercury and other air pollutants.
Fossil fuels under fire
Georgia Power is requesting permission from the PSC to continue burning coal at Plant Scherer near Macon and Plant Bowen outside Cartersville well into the 2030s. Georgia Power  planned to retire one of its Plant Scherer units by the end of 2028 and Plant Bowen’s closure date is uncertain.
Georgia Power is also planning to continue to use coal and gas at Alabama’s Plant Gaston for energy generation.
The commission staff filed a recommendation this month that the company should be allowed to satisfy its projected 2033 needs, which would be 5,226 MW instead of 5,989 MW.
Georgia Power’s resource plan will reinforce its energy demands while also adapting to the changing regulatory environment and supply chain requirements, according to the PSC staff recommendations. The increases will provide Georgia Power with greater flexibility and time to adapt, according to the PSC staff.
Brionté McCorkle, executive director of Georgia Conservation Voters, argued that the driving reasons behind Georgia Power’s fuel rate increase is the continued reliance on fossil fuels.
Georgia Conservation Voters is one of several organizations challenging the power company’s models for predicting the growth of massive data centers. According to the company’s projections, data centers will consume 80% of all electricity, and all customers will benefit from these facilities that support the growing use of artificial intelligence.
Critics contend that the company’s projected demand is overstated and that existing ratepayers could be saddled with the cost of  unnecessary electricity generating infrastructure.
“We’ve seen them double down on gas and coal and all of the costs from Plant Vogtle,” McCorkle said. “All of those things have resulted in people’s bills going up despite public comment for years that people want to see the power company investing in renewable energy and energy efficiency. These are measures that will not only promote clean energy, but also help save the money on their power bills.”
Georgia Power company has been criticized by environmental groups for reversing its plans to close plants Bowen and Scherer, long among the worst polluters in the region. The company is instead seeking approval from state regulators to extend the life of the two plants and expand its fossil fuel energy capacity.
Last year, Georgia regulators signed off on an amended 2022 Georgia Power plan allowing it to build new biomass power plants that will burn wood waste and other organic material to generate electricity.
Jennifer Whitfield, an attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center, said the Georgia Power 2025 plan is unusual since there is a large amount of projected demand that is not based on proven analysis.
“How good are their projections, and are they good enough to make big resource decisions right now?” Whitfield said. “We think that they are not and expect that next week you’re going to hear from a lot of people who say their load forecasts are way too high.”
Whitfield gave credit for the Georgia Power proposal calling for significant investments in energy efficiency that can help ratepayers save money on their bills.
“I think there’s going to be some exciting stuff in (the IRP), but the commission shouldn’t take any action making radical decisions based on the data they have before them because the data is not good,” Whitfield said.
Neil Sardana with the Georgia Conservation Voters Education Fund said the organization will present testimony this week for how Georgia Power can reduce emissions, accelerate coal plant retirement and increase clean energy such as solar, wind and battery storage in a way that could potentially save customers $10 billion by the year 2040.
“Georgia Power could be doing a lot better when it comes to planning and developing resources for energy production that not only improves our air quality emissions and also saves everyday customers tons of money,” Sardana said.

Even before then, by 2030, AI is expected to shape industries and refine jobs which necessitates a comprehensive approach to ensuring Connecticut women are not left behind. It is imperative that we understand and act proactively on this crucial moment – by investing in our educational pipeline, supporting upskilling and reskilling initiatives and passing forward-looking policies like Senate Bill 2.
The impact of AI on women in the workforce
Recent studies paint a clear picture: generative AI and AI automation threaten jobs traditionally held by women, especially in sectors such as administrative support, customer service, food service and retail/sales.  According to a 2024 report from McKinsey Global Institute, approximately 30% of roles held by women are at a high risk of automation within the next five years. Conversely, AI also opens new pathways, if we prepare our workforce, especially women and underserved communities of color, to seize these opportunities.
Connecticut’s COVID-19 recovery underscored how economic instability disproportionately affects women, who often bear the brunt of workforce disruptions due to caregiving responsibilities and occupational clustering.  As AI advances, these disparities, could widen unless deliberate policies support women’s transition into emerging careers.

Building the future of AI careers
Senate Bill 2, which recently passed the State Senate, is poised to be a game-changer.  It is a robust bill covering everything from accountability and algorithmic discrimination to preventing deep fake abuse and supporting workforce development. Critical components of the bill include the creation of the Connecticut AI Academy, targeted upskilling programs, and initiatives to support career pathways in AI and quantum computing.  These investments are essential for continuing to position Connecticut as a leader in AI innovation, an area the governor recognizes as vital to our economic future, as evidenced by his executive investments in artificial intelligence and quantum computing research as reported by the CT Office of Policy and Management, 2024.
Most importantly, SB2 emphasizes upskilling and reskilling programs which ensures that when automation displaces certain roles, the workforce will have pathways into new high-demand sectors such as data science, AI ethics and cybersecurity.
The educational pipeline starts early
We know well that early education shapes future opportunities. Connecticut has an opportunity, and obligation, to foster a robust science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) pipeline starting in elementary school, especially for girls.
Introducing STEM concepts early, providing engaging coding and robotics programs and supporting mentorship initiatives will cultivate a diverse generation of innovators ready to lead in AI. Funding and expanding STEM programs and partnerships with local tech firms will be vital. Additionally, supporting successful initiatives like the Lt. Governor’s Computing Challenge are instrumental in sparking curiosity and interaction with coding, furthering efforts to increase accessibility to STEM education. Connecticut must remain committed to the goal of dismantling the barriers that keep women and girls from pursuing STEM careers, from the outset. Early exposure not only inspires interest but builds the confidence necessary for future success.
Supporting a transition to high-demand AI careers
Senate Bill 2 also intimates investments in adult retraining initiatives crucial for women already in the workforce.  As the McKinsey report indicates, effective retraining reduces unemployment risk and smooths the transition from traditional roles to tech-driven careers. Programs such as the Connecticut Online AI Academy will serve as hubs for learning and reskilling, likely offering accessible training in AI development, machine learning and related fields.
Moreover, the state must continue to innovate on how we incentivize private sector partnerships, internships and apprenticeships — building pipelines from education to employment that prioritize equity and inclusion.
Now is the time to act
Delaying action leaves too many women vulnerable to job losses and wage stagnation– particularly those in lower-income brackets or in industries most susceptible to automation. By proactively supporting AI-related career pathways, we mitigate the risks and maximize the benefits of technological progress.
We are at a pivotal moment. Senate bill 2’s passage through the Senate paves the way for vital investments in Connecticut’s AI economy – if it advances through the House.  Our collective goal must be to ensure that women and girls, and others who lack opportunity have equal access to training, employment opportunities in artificial intelligence fields, and leadership roles in the burgeoning tech sector. By doing so, we will not only foster economic growth but also create a more inclusive and resilient workforce prepared for the innovations of tomorrow.

It’s the harsh reality that grips not only Suffield, but every district in the state – as administrators scramble to do more with less in the face of skyrocketing fiscal pressures that are exacerbated by soaring special education costs.
Now, more than ever, we need our state legislature and governor to work together to fulfill their fiscal and moral obligation to students who receive special education services. Districts across our state, including Suffield, need immediate and lasting special education funding reform.
As lawmakers continue exploring options for such reform, they do so knowing that the financial burdens felt by districts not only impact special education services, but also the ability of districts to maintain essential programs and resources for the entire student population. Districts like Suffield often have no choice but to make cuts to be mindful of the impact of an escalating property tax burden on residents.
In recent years, the state’s surplus has grown to a staggering $4.6 billion, yet state reimbursement for special education has dropped while student needs have sharply increased. Budgeting for special education is challenging due to the formula used for excess cost reimbursement and the unpredictability of students with various needs moving into town after budgets have been adopted.
The state has long promised greater special education reimbursement, but has consistently failed to deliver. Rather than broken promises, districts like Suffield need reliable and predictable solutions.
We urge lawmakers to consider the following options to bring relief to districts across the state.
1) Fully fund the Excess Cost Grant: This grant is designed to reimburse districts for special education expenses above an established threshold, but has not been fully funded since 2009. Recently, reimbursements for districts such as Suffield have been further scaled back.
While a $40 million rescue package brought much needed relief earlier this legislative session, the amount brought Suffield’s excess cost reimbursement rate from 62% to 75%, leaving town taxpayers to close the $407,000 gap.
2) Address high costs of outplacement programs: The cost of out-of-district placements continues to escalate for a number of reasons, including that such programs are increasingly run by private investors.
Districts stand to save substantial amounts of money if they could service high-needs students closer to home. Grants to help offset the high cost of developing and launching local programs and capping expenses for districts that utilize private programs are desperately needed.
3) Address costs associated with mid-year transfers: Costs for students who transfer into districts mid-year can be significant and challenging to absorb into already adopted budgets. Districts need relief from these unexpected and unpredictable expenses.
In Suffield, we are proud to offer opportunities to students of all needs. So are districts across the state. However, we cannot continue to bear the burden of the state’s fiscal shortfalls.
Now is the time for our state legislature and governor to fulfill their obligation to our state’s most vulnerable students. Implementing special education funding reform will be a crucial step in helping districts like Suffield stop painful cuts, enhance academic outcomes, and position each and every student to reach their full potential.

The 2025 poll points to a continuing trend in the chamber’s polling, with Richard Czuba, the president of the Chicago-based Glengariff which conducted the poll, telling reporters during a discussion of the 2024 data that political affiliation is a major factor in economic perception.
While last year’s assessment saw a more negative perception of the economy from Republicans and a more positive assessment from Democrats and independents, the 2025 assessment saw the opposite. 
“Democrats have gone from 62% in January, thinking the economy is growing to now 17%. Independents have dropped from 35 to 25[%] but Republican base voters have jumped from 22 to 64[%] that think the economy is growing,” Czuba said. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Of the 600 registered voters polled, 62.4% see a weakening economy, while 34.4% say it’s growing. 
Fears of a recession have similarly jumped, rising from 20.5% in September to 27.2% in January and 38.2% in April, a shift Czuba attributes to Democrats and independents. 
“Democrats’ concern of a recession has gone from 43 to 73[%],” Czuba said. 
“Independents have gone from 22 to 40[%], so doubled amongst independents. But base Republicans, fear of a recession has fallen from 15 to six[%],” he said. 
On inflation, Democrats’ concerns have increased by 25 percentage points, while concern among independents has jumped by 21 percentage points. Republicans on the other hand saw a two percentage point decrease in their inflation concerns. 
Despite holding increasingly worse perceptions about the economy, voters aren’t reporting big changes in their own situation, Czuba said. 
“Right now, 26% say they’re worse off than they were a year ago. 17 better, and 56% say the same. That’s identical to January. 21% of those who are in the workforce are concerned about losing their job. That also is unchanged since January,” Czuba said. 
Additionally, 86% of voters polled said they believed their job would still be available in five years, compared to 8% who said it would not be. 
“It’s interesting who said it would not be. If you are lower income, household incomes under $50,000, you rise to 20% thinking your job will not be there. If you are a respondent in an automotive manufacturing household, it’s 16%,” Czuba said. 
The divide over tariffs
When looking at tariffs, 51% of Michiganders oppose President Donald Trump’s tariff policies while 43% support them. However, 30% say they strongly support them while 43% strongly oppose the tariffs. 
There is no better issue to illustrate the divide amongst voters right now than tariffs, Czuba said, noting that 96% of Democrats oppose them while 92% of Republicans support them. Independent voters were split with 29% in support and 51% opposed.
“You can’t get more divided than that,” Czuba said.

Automotive households were similarly split with 48% in support and 46% opposed.
However, voters across the board said that tariffs will cost them more money, with 78.6% voters in agreement.
“Even a majority of those base Republicans, strong Republicans, believe tariffs mean they pay more. While they agree they pay more, that doesn’t stop them from supporting the tariffs. 92% of those base Republicans support the tariffs, while 56% say they will end up paying more,” Czuba said. “Forty-nine percent of independents support the tariffs, and 87% of independents say they’ll pay more. So a third of the voters who say tariffs are going to cost them more still support them.”
In light of these tariff concerns, 55% of Democrats and 44% of independents have changed their spending habits. Twenty-one percent of voters overall said they’ve delayed purchases, while 14% said they sped them up. 
“The top delays were automobiles and home improvement. The top sped up purchases were electronics, automobiles and home repairs,” Czuba said. 
Meanwhile only 7% of Republicans have altered their spending habits due to tariffs. 
Overall 21% of Michiganders polled said they’d been impacted by tariffs with the majority of that share citing increased costs. 
Additionally, while 54% of voters say tariffs will be bad for Michigan, 9% of that share still supported the new levies. 
However, 48% of respondents expected the tariffs would create more manufacturing jobs, compared to 28% who said they would create less and 15% who expected no change. 
The polling also looks specifically at the auto industry, with 65% of respondents saying it would hurt Michigan if China became the world leader on electric vehicles, with the majority of voters across every demographic group in agreement. 
Despite these concerns, Czuba noted that 35% of Republicans said it would have no impact on Michigan while 38% of auto manufacturing households gave the same answer, compared to 55% of auto households who agreed China leading the EV industry would hurt the state. 
While 56.3% of voters said the U.S. should compete for EV manufacturing and 57.9% saying Michigan should compete, 24% of voters who said letting China lead would hurt Michigan’s economy still say Michigan should not lead, Czuba noted, with most of these voters being Republicans. 
Looking across the spectrum 72% of Democrats and 56% of independents agreed Michigan should compete aggressively for EV manufacturing, 54% of Republicans said the state should not compete. 
Education perceptions
Czuba and Baruah also looked at education, with 70% of voters saying a college education is important for making a living wage and supporting a family, compared to 27% who said it’s not important. 
However only 17% of voters said a four year college education is affordable. 
“They do strongly agree and understand by a tune of two-thirds that a two year college education is affordable. And that’s a good thing, because with the policy work that’s been done in Michigan over the last few years, two years of college, either at community college or at a four year institution, is largely paid for, for most students should they choose to do that,” Baruah said.

Czuba explained that while there’s a large ecosystem telling students that they’re crazy for pursuing a four-year degree due to the high cost, they’re not hearing information on how to make college affordable, or at least reduce costs. 
“So many issues are now getting dragged into the mill of polarization. There used to be a general consensus amongst Michigan voters for a long, long time that college education or further education was a good thing. We’re starting to see that’s not necessarily the case, because it’s being whipped into this polarization mill that we have now,” Czuba said. 
Confidence in democracy
In revisiting a data point from last year, Czuba also discussed Michigan voter’s faith in democracy. 
“Back in May of ‘24 29% were satisfied, 66% were dissatisfied. This year it’s largely unchanged,” Czuba said. 
However, the big shift, once again, came down to political affiliation, with Democrat dissatisfaction jumping from 55% to 85% over the last year, and Independent dissatisfaction increasing from 63% to 75%. Republicans saw a shift in the opposite direction with dissatisfaction decreasing from 81% to 43% while their level of satisfaction increased from 15 to 51%. 
As Michigan stares down another election year, and what will likely be a hotly contested race for the Governors seat and the U.S. Senate, alongside multiple competitive U.S. House districts, Czuba emphasized one point. 
“It’s independents who are going to make decisions in Michigan. And so we have to pay particular attention to where they are on all of these issues.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/blue-red-voting-booths-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-05-27 01:02:20.415897

As the workforce ages, the Association of American Medical Colleges estimates the physician shortage will increase to over 86,000 physicians by 2036. 
Connecticut is not immune with almost 20% of residents already living in designated Health Professional Shortage Areas (HPSAs) with fewer than one primary care physician per 3,500 residents.
This critical shortage has dire consequences for the health of Connecticut residents. Wait times to see primary care physicians already average over 26 days and are projected to get longer. As fewer physicians struggle to manage the health of an ever-growing population, healthcare outcomes suffer. One study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine showed that the average life expectancy of people living in HPSAs was almost a full year shorter than those who do not. In short, physician shortages kill.
Connecticut ranks 46 out of 50 states in physician retention, as only 41.7% of physicians who complete their residency in Connecticut remain here to practice medicine. By contrast, the proportion of physicians who stay in the highest-ranking states, California and Texas, after training are 78% and 66%, respectively. This dire situation demands urgent action to attract physicians to our state rather than push them away, to prevent our physician shortage from getting worse.
An Act Limiting Out-of-Network Costs (H.B. 6871) is being proposed, purportedly to control healthcare costs. However, beyond worsening the physician shortage that is already drowning Connecticut’s healthcare system, we are concerned that this bill would also particularly devastate rural hospitals and small physician-run private practices. 
At first glance, the bill’s goals appear innocuous, capping the maximum amount that healthcare providers could charge health insurers for out-of-network care at 240% of the Medicare rate. However, by tilting the balance in negotiations far in favor of insurers over physicians and hospitals, this bill would do serious damage to the ability of healthcare providers to negotiate fair rates with insurers. These adverse consequences have led to a coalition of physicians and hospitals from around the state to warn of dire consequences for access to care in Connecticut should the bill pass.
Medicare reimbursement for hospitals and physicians is 50% and 70% the rate of private insurers, respectively. Even worse, Medicare payments to physicians have fallen 33% in inflation-adjusted terms since 2001. Tying out-of-network reimbursement to Medicare rates would place providers at a significant disadvantage as these rates continue to decline. 
Physicians and other clinicians will become scarcer as practicing in Connecticut becomes infeasible. Hospitals will close. Essential physician practices, beloved by the communities they serve, will be forced to shut their doors for good.  As struggling healthcare facilities and practices are forced to close, the health of Connecticut residents will ultimately suffer. Rather than the approach being offered by this bill, which will limit services while not addressing the root causes of cost, we advocate for focus on policies to improve physician retention in and recruitment to Connecticut. 
Tax and regulatory incentives can entice physicians to move or keep their practices here. Providing student loan relief to young physicians who are being crushed by sky-high student loan debt in the face of high cost of living can make it practical for them to start their lives and careers here.

The Road to Omaha now has its road map, and we should hear no complaints from Hattiesburg, Starkville or Oxford. As per usual, Mississippi will be well represented in the NCAA Baseball Tournament.
Ole Miss and Southern Miss will both host NCAA Regionals and Mississippi State, after a season in which it fired the head coach, is in the tournament as a 3-seed at Florida State. You won’t see that happen often.

Rick Cleveland
First things first: Ole Miss, the No. 10 national seed, will play Murray State Friday night at 7 p.m. Southern Miss, the 16-seed, will play Columbia University Friday night at 6 p.m. State plays Northeastern, which has won 26 straight games, Friday night at 6:30 at Tallahassee.
In the other half of the Oxford regional, Georgia Tech plays Western Kentucky. In the other first round game at Hattiesburg, Alabama plays Miami. At Tallahassee, host Florida State will play Bethune-Cookman.
You ask me, both Southern Miss coach Christian Ostrander and Ole Miss coach Mike Bianco have big decisions to make. Both teams have established pitching aces in USM’s JB Middleton and the Rebels’ Hunter Elliott. Do you start your ace against the weaker 4-seed, or do you save him to pitch against a decidedly more formidable opponent on Saturday? Clearly, State interim head coach Justin Parker doesn’t face the same quandary. You go with your best when facing a higher seed with a 26-game win streak – no matter what league they play in.
The old school approach is that the next game is the most important game. In other words, throw you ace. Keep in mind also, you need for your game one starter to go as deep as possible into the game, saving your bullpen arms for a long weekend. The flip side: Having your best pitcher available to start the second game gives you a decided edge going against your opponent’s No. 2 pitcher.
Bianco’s decision is complicated by the fact that Murray State, the Missouri Valley Conference regular season and tournament champions, is one of the nation’s best No. 4 seeds. The Racers have won 39 games and seven for their last eight. In mid-week regular season games, the Racers lost 8-7 in 10 innings at Ole Miss and won at Kentucky 5-4. Using golf terminology, Murray is no gimme. The Racers hit .301 as a team. Still, I’d lean toward holding Elliott for either ACC regular season champ Georgia Tech or Western Kentucky.

Southern Miss head coach Christian Ostrander has a decision to make before Friday’s regional opener.
At USM, Ostrander must strongly consider holding Middleton, the recent Ferriss Trophy winner and likely All-American and high MLB draft choice. Columbia, the Ivy League regular season and tournament champ, hits at a .290 clip but, at least on paper, has pitching issues. The Lions’ team earned run average is 6.57 and opponents are hitting .290 against them. Me? I’d take my chances with Matt Adams, who has been really good of late, against Columbia, and then have Middleton, he of the 10-1 record and .168 opponents’ batting average, to go against Alabama or Miami. Southern Miss has won all six of Adams’ most recent starts, and he threw seven innings of four-hit, shutout baseball against Old Dominion in the Sun Belt Conference Tournament.
More college baseball observations:
• The SEC placed a record 13 teams in the tournament, which represents roughly 20 percent of the field. The only SEC selection I’d quibble with: Kentucky, at 29-24 and losing its last four and seven of its last 10 games.
• Color me surprised the Troy Trojans were left out of the 64-team field. Troy finished 39-21 and was nationally ranked for much of the season. Troy was the nation’s only team that hadn’t lost a weekend series until being swept in the last series of the regular season by Southern Miss. The Trojans did lose six of their last eight, and it now seems certain that the 2-1 loss to USM in the Sun Belt semifinals probably kept them out. 
• Ole Miss, picked to finish 15th in the SEC, is instead the 10th national seed. Mike Bianco deserves strong consideration for any Coach of the Year honor out there.
• Looking ahead: The Oxford Regional is matched with the Athens Regional, meaning if the No. 1 seeds advance, Ole Miss would play a Super Regional at Georgia, a team the Rebels did not play in 2025. The Hattiesburg Regional is matched with the Nashville Regional, which means Southern Miss, the No. 16 national seed, would play overall 1-seed Vandy if both teams advance. The Tallahassee Regional is matched against the Corvallis Regional, which means State would likely head far to the west if the Bulldogs can advance.
• Southern Miss has now achieved nine consecutive 40-win seasons. No other Division I baseball team in the country has done that. This will be the Golden Eagles’ ninth consecutive NCAA Tournament appearance (not counting the 2020 season curtailed by Covid).",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/06155430/AP_22157085286549-scaled.jpg,,,2025-05-26 19:01:23.290306

(Photo courtesy of Scott and Julia Whitnall)Like many moderate-income workers, public school teachers Julia and Scott Whitnall didn’t think they’d become homeowners in their early 30s. Especially in California.
“We never felt homeownership was in our cards. But we did it!” Julia Whitnall said. “We’re extremely happy.”
The couple moved May 16 to a $509,000 two-bedroom house in Ripon, east of San Francisco in the Central Valley region.
It wasn’t easy. Despite a relatively high combined income of $140,000 from their nearby jobs, they had to compromise on size and take on extra work at summer camps to pull it off. Then they had to exercise patience as the sellers struggled to find a new home.
High interest rates and high prices in a still-competitive housing market continue to make it tough for first-time buyers, even those with good but moderate incomes.
On a national level, households making $75,000 to $100,000 — typical of teachers, nurses and skilled trades workers in many states — face a daunting lack of homes they can afford. That’s according to new research by the National Association of Realtors and Realtor.com based on listings in March of this year compared with 2024. However, the numbers showed an encouraging 20% increase in homes for sale, affordable or not.
Despite more houses for sale, those moderate-income buyers — which the report called “middle- and upper-middle-income buyers” — are much more hard-pressed to find an affordable home than they were in 2019, when almost half the homes on the market were affordable to them. This year they can afford only 21.2% of homes on the market — a slight improvement compared with 20.8% in 2024, according to the report.
It also found that a few states are improving in affordability for people in the $75,000-to-$100,000 income range. But many states are not.
The largest affordability gaps are in California, Hawaii, Idaho, Massachusetts and Montana, where such households can afford fewer than 12% of houses on the market. By contrast, they could afford about half the houses for sale in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Ohio and West Virginia.
There’s progress in states that are adding more housing at moderate price points: Arizona, Colorado, Delaware, Florida and Utah, according to the Realtors report.


 Balanced markets

Nationwide, to get home markets back in line with moderate-income families, the United States needs 416,000 more homes for sale at or below $255,000, according to the report.
“In many places, we’re still seeing a huge mismatch between income levels and what’s available to buy for moderate-income families,” said Nadia Evangelou, the National Association of Realtors’ senior economist and director of real estate research.
“We are no longer in crisis mode, but we are still very far from where we need to be. We can’t fix it overnight. It will take years,” Evangelou said.
Heather, who asked not to share her last name for privacy reasons, said she can’t even think of buying a house near her job on Long Island, New York. She makes more than $100,000 as a registered nurse and her family makes $170,000 with her husband’s job in building maintenance. But $4,400 in rent and $2,000 in monthly day care costs for three children have them living paycheck to paycheck.
“We can’t even afford a small car repair, let alone a mortgage in our hometown” of Ronkonkoma in Suffolk County, Heather said. Their jobs exposed her and her husband to risks in the pandemic that her neighbors avoided with remote work, she said. But she now feels like she’s in worse shape financially than she was in 2019 and considers moving away.
“All of our hard work feels like it was for nothing,” Heather said. “It’s disheartening that we can’t afford to live where we grew up, but that’s the reality we are facing.”
Some states can still be a refuge of affordability.
Ashley and Tristan Jonas bought a $252,000 house in northwest Ohio after three years of getting shut out by higher or all-cash offers. Ashley Jonas, 32, trained as a teacher but now works in skilled trades as a project coordinator for a countertop company, and the couple makes about $140,000 with Tristan Jonas’ job as a computer programmer.
“We happened to hit the market at the right time in 2025,” Ashley Jonas said. “We bid on this house just as [President Donald] Trump was announcing tariffs. I think a lot of people were holding their coin purses. We weren’t.”
 Help for teachers

Teachers, who generally make less than nurses or trades workers, are particularly squeezed. Some states, facing teacher shortages in local schools, are working to raise pay. And increasingly, some schools and hospitals are providing housing to lure more teachers and nurses.
“We lose so many teachers because they can’t find housing here,” said Autumn Rivera, a 20-year teaching veteran and 2022 Colorado Teacher of the Year. Despite her experience and credentials, Rivera said she can’t contemplate buying even a townhouse in the rural resort town of Glenwood Springs, where she teaches.
Prices for those townhouses now start in the $700,000 range, more than twice what they were when she last considered buying in 2019. Rivera feels lucky to have a reasonable rent by sharing a home with its owner, but many teachers in her Roaring Fork Schools need the 117 apartments provided by the district with affordable rent, she said. The district hopes the apartments will allow teachers to save up for a home; it has also built 14 houses for staff with Habitat for Humanity and Holy Cross Energy.
One way to make homebuying more feasible for teachers is to pay them more — a strategy that paid off for New Mexico, one of the few bright spots in a different report on teachers’ inability to afford housing, which was published this month by the National Council on Teacher Quality, a research and advocacy group.
Beginning teachers in Albuquerque saw a 60% increase in pay between 2019 and 2025, which fell just short of a 65% jump in home prices, according to the report. The report credited a state law that raised teacher salaries, including starting pay, by $10,000.
“We’re dealing with the issue of teachers being able to live in the communities where they’re actually working,” said state Rep. Joy Garratt, a Democrat who sponsored a new law, signed in April, that sets higher minimum salaries for teachers effective July 1.
Detroit schools also gave teachers with advanced degrees a pay boost of up to 50% since 2019, about the same increase as home prices, according to the report from the National Council on Teacher Quality. Albuquerque and Detroit are on the report’s list of most affordable places for beginning teachers to live.
But nationally, on average, experienced teachers who started in 2019 are less able to afford a home now than when they began, according to the report.
“Teacher pay has gone up 24% in the last five years, which some might say is solid growth, and yet the increase in house for purchase has gone up 47%,” said Heather Peske, the organization’s president.
“Housing prices are critical to being able to attract and keep great teachers,” Peske said. “People will be leaving the profession trying to find something that pays enough for housing. And bottom line, kids won’t get as good an education.”

(Photo by Thomas Barwick/Getty Images)Despite Republican U.S. Congress members’ intentions to set Medicaid work requirements at a federal level, South Dakota officials plan to ask President Donald Trump to approve their own set of Medicaid work requirements.
Medicaid is government-funded health insurance for people with low incomes, and for adults and children with disabilities. South Dakotans voted in 2022 to expand Medicaid to adults with incomes below 138% of the poverty level, a decision that allowed the state to capitalize on a 90% federal funding match. In 2024, voters passed another constitutional amendment to let the state to seek approval from the federal government to impose Medicaid work requirements. 
The state’s waiver proposal seeking approval for a Medicaid work requirement had been drafted by the time Congress began to debate work requirements at the federal level this year. 


Two public hearings will be held during the public comment period:

10:30 a.m. May 30 at the DSS office in Pierre.
11 a.m. June 12 at the DSS OneStop office in Sioux Falls.

Written comments can be emailed to MedicaidSPA@state.sd.us with the subject line “SDCareerLink Public Comment,” or mailed to the Division of Medical Services in Pierre.


Individuals working, earning an income and gaining “independence and self-sufficiency” experience “greater health and economic well-being,” the proposal states.
Ben Hanson, North and South Dakota government relations director for the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, said barriers to accessible and affordable health care hurt South Dakotans in the long run. He worries work requirements at the state or federal level will burden employees and small business owners with paperwork. A majority  of Medicaid recipients already work or are exempted from work, he said.
Given South Dakota’s tight budget outlook, he worries lawmakers won’t pay to properly staff and oversee a work requirement program. Too little staff and too much paperwork, could keepSouth Dakotans from seeking needed care, he said, which could lead to more costly expenses if a medical condition goes untreated.
“It seems like it’s set up for non-success,” Hanson said.
The state will take public comment on its proposal through June 18.
How is SD’s proposal different from the federal proposal?
At the federal level, proposed Medicaid work requirements would mandate those between 19 and 65 who rely on the state-federal health program to work, participate in community service, or attend an educational program for at least 80 hours each month.
South Dakota’s state-level work rules, as proposed, wouldn’t require employed Medicaid recipients to work or be in school for a set number of hours. The state would review compliance on an annual basis, at the time of Medicaid renewal.
The federal government also has more exceptions to its proposed changes than the state.
South Dakota would allow exceptions for people who are:

Pregnant or postpartum,
Disabled, as determined by the Social Security Administration,
Have a cancer or other serious or terminal medical condition verified by a physician,
In an intensive behavioral health treatment program, hospitalized or living in a nursing home facility,
In an area with at least unemployment 20% higher than the national average and are exempt from SNAP requirements for able-bodied adults without dependents.

People who would meet the state’s requirements are:

Employed
Enrolled in job training or school
Caretakers for a dependent child in their home
Caretakers for an elderly or disabled person in their home
People who already meet work requirements for other federal programs like SNAP or unemployment insurance.

The federal program would also exempt tribal community members, those in the foster care system, people who were in foster care who are younger than 26, individuals released from incarceration in the last 90 days, among others, from work requirements.
During Trump’s first administration, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services approved 13 state work requirement waivers. Arkansas’ program was the first to implement its program in 2018, but that state was stopped by a federal court after nine months. About 18,000 people lost coverage in Arkansas. Employment levels did not increase.
The Biden administration rescinded all work requirement approvals, but Georgia started its own work requirement program in July 2023 without federal support.
How would work requirements impact South Dakota’s Medicaid expansion enrollment?
Per South Dakota Department of Social Services’ estimate, 80% of the people who got coverage under Medicaid expansion already work or wouldn’t have to under its proposed work requirement.
South Dakota’s Medicaid expansion population as of April 2025 stood at 30,542. Covering the expansion population will cost about $364.5 million this year.
A work requirement program would reduce enrollment by 5-10% in the first year, the department said. 
That would save the Medicaid program between $48.9 million and $71 million in the first year, the department claims. In the following years, the department expects enrollment to stay flat if work requirements are implemented rather than grow at a previously anticipated 2% each year.
South Dakota voters will decide next year whether to continue requiring Medicaid expansion if federal support for the program declines. The ballot question will ask voters to authorize the termination of Medicaid expansion if federal support falls below 90%.
In addition to setting work requirements at a federal level, Republicans pushed a Medicaid overhaul through the House in a budget reconciliation package this week. The changes reduce the program by $625 million over 10 years under the latest estimate by the Congressional Budget Office.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/hospitalbed-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-26 13:11:50.348577

(Photo by Tom Foley/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Americans check their phone on average 205 times a day or around once every five minutes. With phones seldom out of reach, it can be difficult to moderate usage in an increasingly connected world. For many people, this habit can persist even when behind the wheel, but the distraction it provides can have real consequences. 
On July 1, Iowa law enforcement will begin distributing warnings for the handheld use of electronic devices while driving. Here’s how to break texting and driving habits before then to avoid a penalty, or worse.
For background, Senate File 22, signed on April 2, 2025, bans the handheld use of cellphones and other electronic devices while driving when not in hands-free or voice-activated mode. Officers will begin enforcing the act on July 1, and will begin penalizing violations on Jan. 1, 2026. Drivers convicted of a violation will be charged with a simple misdemeanor after Jan. 1.
Here are some tips from four Iowans who work to decrease distracted driving in their communities on how to break the habit for good:
Understanding the risks
“People need to recognize that operating an electronic device while they’re driving is a distraction, and that distraction can cause harm to others and themselves,” said Larry Loss, an active cyclist and Des Moines metro resident since 1993.
Loss was crossing an intersection on his bike on May 18, 2022, when a young male driver, who was on his phone, made a right turn directly in front of him. Loss was cut off from the bike trail and collided into the curb, which propelled him into the concrete base of a utility pole. The injuries he sustained resulted in two surgeries, 17 days in the hospital, and left him unable to return to work for two months. The driver of the car never stopped.
Loss, however, considers himself to be one of the “lucky ones,” as he can still tell his story. 
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reports that in 2023, 3,275 lives were lost and around 325,000 were injured in crashes related to distracted driving. Around 8% of all fatal crashes involved distracted driving. 
The day of the crash, BikeIowa was holding its 18th annual Ride of Silence. Every year since 2005, cyclists from across Iowa have gathered to remember the riders injured and killed on the roads and trails in the past year, celebrate current achievements, and discuss how to continually make the roads safer for bikers going forward.
  Scott Sumpter, founder of BikeIowa, reads from a list of recorded cycling accidents at the 21st annual Ride of Silence, Wednesday, May 21, 2025, outside the State Historical Society of Iowa.(Photo by Tom Foley/Iowa Capital Dispatch)
Loss joined Luke Hoffman, director of the Iowa Bicycle Coalition, Scott Sumpter, founder of BikeIowa, and many others for the 21st annual Ride of Silence on Wednesday.
Loss says drivers should determine if their vehicle has Bluetooth capability and get the system set up as soon as possible to prepare for the changes in the law. If not, researching a compatible Bluetooth adapter or external system will allow drivers time to familiarize themselves with this technology before the law goes into effect on July 1.
Identify triggers
“If you are tempted to reach for your phone in the cup holder, maybe leave it in your bag” said Ryan Crane, executive director of NAMI Iowa.
Crane is the executive director of the Iowa branch of the National Alliance on Mental Illness. NAMI Iowa registered in favor of Senate File 22 during the legislative process. NAMI Iowa works to help communities address concerns about mental illness and provide information on treatment. 
A 2024 report from reviews.org, found not only that Americans check their phones over 200 times a day on average also that the figure represented a 42.3% increase from 2023. The survey also showed that over 43% of Americans feel addicted to their phones — and like other addictions, the habit is not easy to break.
Crane recommends drivers compassionately but intentionally observe themselves as they drive to understand what triggers them to pick up their phone. NAMI Iowa and other mental health institutions have recently begun to promote the importance of self-compassion as the standard for mental health practices.
Research by the Stanford Center for Compassion and Altruism Research and Education indicates that self-compassion is a learnable mindset that is linked to decreased stress and increased productivity. These things can play a major role in personal ability to identify and modify behaviors. By understanding what triggers the impulse, without excessive self-judgment, each driver can implement a solution that works for them. 
“Awareness is honestly the first step,” Crane said.
Some solutions may include finding another activity to replace the habit, such as anchoring their hands on 10 and two, placing their phone out of arm’s reach, regularly creating new playlists to prevent constant song-skipping, etc.
Finish online work before beginning to drive
“If you have text messages, emails, phone calls that you need to handle, do that right as you get in the car,” said Luke Hoffman, executive director of Iowa Bicycle Coalition.
Hoffman and the Iowa Bicycle Coalition were major supporters of Senate File 22, with some members advocating for some form of a hands-free bill for more than 10 years. He believes that this act is a “fundamental leap forward for safety in Iowa.” 
Hoffman and the IBC plan to launch a “Safe Roads Iowa” educational campaign sometime after July 1, which seeks to educate local communities on best practices for driving safety.
Setting aside time to settle online to-dos before driving may grant drivers the peace of mind to put down the phone while on the road.
This can take the form of setting up GPS directions prior to starting the car, utilizing the “add stop” GPS function for each destination if there are multiple, enabling driving mode on Android devices or driving focus on Apple and ensuring no notifications are set up to bypass this feature, etc.
Rely on passengers
“If you have a passenger, designate them to be your phone person,” said Dr. Cara Hamann, director of the University of Iowa Transportation Research and Injury Prevention Safety Lab and UI associate professor of epidemiology.
Hamann and the TRIPS lab put together a policy brief that outlined “the gaps in the distracted driving laws in Iowa.” She also personally made visits to the Capitol to speak with legislators about her research and inform them about her findings. 
Among facts outlined in the brief:

State bans on handheld phones while driving reduce handheld usage of electronics devices shortly after the laws take effect by almost 50%;
Handheld bans are associated with fewer driver deaths, while texting-only bans are not and may be more enforceable by law enforcement.

A designated phone user allows the driver to stay connected without investing in Bluetooth or other hands-free hardware. Designating a phone user ensures drivers aren’t tempted to pick up the phone themselves.
This may be a solution for drivers with non-integrated cars who can’t afford to invest in additional hardware. Other than working as a designated phone user, Hamann recommends passengers speak up if drivers go to grab their phone while on the road.

(Photo courtesy of the University of Iowa Office of Innovation)A little-known, not-taught facet of the nursing profession is the art of the workaround, Allison Hurt said — taking something that isn’t working in the situation and making it fit for whatever the patient or fellow staff members need.
When she started working in the University of Iowa Hospitals & Clinics burn unit, Hurt said one workaround was cutting gauze and dressings to better fit the burned area of a patient’s body.
Later, when she transferred to the medical intensive care unit that later became the COVID-19 unit at the start of the pandemic, workarounds involved using long lines of IV tubing to have machinery and equipment outside of a patient’s room, allowing nurses to administer medicine and check information while saving important personal protection equipment.
“I didn’t realize I was innovating when I was doing it,” Hurt said.
In her current role as a Nurse Innovator Liaison for the UI Office of Innovation, Hurt helps other nurses identify challenges, recognize the innovations they’ve been making without realizing it and look ahead to how they can help others with their ideas.
The University of Iowa’s Iowa Nurse Innovators Program connects nurses to the resources and expertise they need to turn workarounds into specially crafted, even marketable, solutions. With early successes from UIHC nurses currently getting off the ground, the program is working to reach health care professionals across the state.

UI Chief Innovation Officer Jon Darsee, who oversees and helped launch the program in fall 2022, said there are many programs aimed at helping faculty or physicians develop their ideas into products or services, but nothing geared specifically toward nurses. With his background in medical technology, Darsee said he learned early on to listen to nurses and their needs.

May is National Nurses Month. According to the American Association of Colleges of Nursing, this is a “time to honor and celebrate the incredible work of nurses.”
The UI Office of Innovation celebrated the month by sharing information about the nurse innovation program and stories of nurses seeing success from their product development.

Since the project’s launch, 1,300 nurses have engaged with the nurse innovation program, according to a newsletter from the UI Office of Innovation. There are 38 active projects in the program, eight of which came from nurses outside of the UI system, and several patent disclosures have been filed. There are four products currently being used by nurses.
A requirement of a donation from the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation in Kansas City was that the innovation program expand beyond the UI and offer opportunities to nurses across the state, which Darsee said was a brilliant idea that hadn’t come to him yet.
“Contributing to the health and happiness of nurses in rural Iowa environments is one way this program can influence patient safety and ultimately the quality care on a local level,” Darsee said.
Bringing resources to the experts
Each of the products designed by nurses have come from challenges they’ve faced in their profession or see others struggling with in the health care system. They’ve developed their own ways of dealing with these issues in the day-to-day, using “workarounds” as Hurt described them.
Nurses commit to around 27 workarounds per 12-hour shift, Hurt said, and program staff learn about them by visiting different hospital units personally to speak with staff.
“We’ve discovered that the way that works best is having nurses identify their challenges where they’re happening,” Hurt said. “It’s obviously kind of fresh in their mind — in-the-moment frustration is really kind of what we’re going for.”
Once a nurse has identified a challenge, Hurt said the program and its partner, prototyping company MakerHealth, work with the nurse on their schedule to further discussions about the problem, how they’ve tried to solve it in the past and what solution they’re hoping to develop.
It was on one of these visits when Courtney Smith learned about the program. The nurse innovator team had brought their “innovation station” to a nurse staff council committee meeting and asked if anyone knew about innovation projects, which Smith had previous experience with at a different job.
With the help of the nurse innovators program, Smith collected all the information and materials belonging to her from her previous work and got started where she left off — developing a tool to get cords and wires off the operating floor and out of the way.

Smith has created and tested multiple iterations of her invention, a cord clamp designed to attach to a patient’s bed and hold cords out of the way of foot traffic. She and those helping her in the program are working on different attachments to handle other materials that may need to be held out of the way.
Staff members who have worked with Smith while she used it have enjoyed its functionality and simplicity, she said, and that it is easy to sanitize after doing its job.
“I think right now, our biggest barrier is the fact that I’m the only one that currently carries it around with me, I take it with me when I go,” Smith said.
For nurses just starting out on their idea, Hurt said the program provides them with a kit full of materials to design and craft a low-fidelity, or rough draft, version of their product. After figuring out what works and what doesn’t, the nurse has more discussions with the team before trying out new materials and designs, until they have a functional prototype. All of this is at no cost to the nurse.
At this point the nurse graduates from the MakerHealth portion of the program, Hurt said, and from there they can work with the UI Office of Innovation to eventually bring their idea to market, if that’s what they wish.
The program has also helped nurses who are already making products to think bigger about how — and who — they could help.
Lynette Kenne, a retired UIHC nurse with decades of experience in different areas of the field, said her product was inspired by her first grandchild, who was diagnosed as an infant with mild-to-moderate permanent hearing loss.
Her daughter reached out to her one day asking if she still had a sewing machine and could make something to cover her grandchild’s ears, as he would keep taking out his hearing aids and try to put them in his mouth.
After some trial and error, Kenne said she’s developed a small beanie with a band around the bottom and mesh patches over the ears in order to keep it on but comfortable for the wearer. She connected with a UI Health Care audiologist to give the extra hats she made to other babies and toddlers getting fitted for hearing aids before ever connecting with the innovators program.
“I think this has made me think big about how (to) bring a good service to more than just the people locally,” Kenne said.

The innovation program helped Kenne expand her knowledge about how infants’ heads change as they grow, what would be needed for older children with disabilities to be able to use the hats, what materials are best and more.
Kenne’s eyes were also opened to the idea of eventually marketing the hats in order to reach more people in need. Her next steps include reaching out to audiologists across the state to gauge their interest in the product and finding ways to make the sewing process faster.
Nurses were neither told nor taught in school about workarounds and how often they would need to adapt their materials and equipment to fit patients’ needs, Kenne said, and having this program just for them is an immense help.
“We have lots and lots of nurses across the state and across the nation that for years and years and years have been doing workarounds simply because they don’t have a product or a process that currently works,” Kenne said. “And this is a little tickler to say, if you have an idea, come talk to us and we’ll help you make it a reality.”
Expanding ideas and program reach
Without the UI Nurse Innovators Program, Smith said her cord clip would still be an idea she left behind, and Kenne said she would still be thinking small when it came to who her hats could help.
Both innovators have taken steps to determine whether their products can be patented, something Smith said she would have never been able to accomplish without the program’s support.
“I feel like the nurse innovators program makes me feel limitless when it comes to the capabilities that we are able to achieve with these products,” Smith said.
While it may have been in a different way for her than program participants, Hurt said the innovators program helped her get to a better place in her career while looking for the next step. Like the nurses she meets at their stations, the innovation team came to Hurt while she was working on her unit and asked about her challenges, leading her to find and be selected for the liaison position.
Beyond aiding in turning nurses’ ideas into reality, Darsee said the program helps improve quality of life for the nursing profession in general, hopefully leading to more nurses staying in their jobs and combating the national nursing shortage.
“From the leadership perspective, leadership is excited that their nurses are happy, their nurses aren’t chomping at the bit to get away from patient care,” Hurt said. “And by no means are we trying to steal nurses away to start companies. We’re really trying to make nurses’ days better in the place they work, and solve challenges where they are spending 40 hours a week.”
To Darsee and Hurt’s knowledge, there are no other programs like UI Nurse Innovators, in academic settings or otherwise. Other health care systems, including hospitals, nursing homes and more, have spoken with the team about trying to start their own, similar programs, Darsee said.
“There is no reason why this couldn’t go to any hospital, anywhere you have a nurse,” Darsee said.

(Courtesy of Jon Bahr/MilkShake Factory)The number of births in some Western states that are adding new housing rose last year, reversing losses the year before in many cases, according to new federal statistics released Wednesday.
Increases from 2023 to 2024 were highest in Colorado (4.5%), Idaho (3.8%), Utah (3.6%), Washington state and Nebraska (each 2.6%). Births increased around 2% in West Virginia, South Dakota, North Carolina, Montana, Rhode Island and South Carolina.
Almost all those states had decreases in births the previous year, and many have been building housing rapidly since 2023. Idaho, North Carolina and Utah have issued enough building permits in 2023 and 2024 to add about 4% to their housing stock, the highest in the nation.
Melissa Kearney, an economics professor at the University of Maryland who specializes in families and fertility, said there could be a link between homebuilding and more babies.
“It is quite possible that increased access to home ownership, coming from a reduction in the price of houses in places that are building more houses, could meaningfully increase birth rates,” Kearney told Stateline in an e-mail.
Many of the other states with increases in births are also seeing building booms: Colorado, Nebraska, South Carolina, South Dakota and Washington state are all set to add more than 2% to housing stock based on permits issued in 2023 and 2024, according to a Stateline analysis of U.S. Census Bureau Building Permits Survey data.

 
Building permits can take up to two years to translate into finished houses and apartments, but they indicate which states are most willing to allow new housing that can boost population, tax receipts and the workforce. In Colorado, Denver County is set to add almost 10,000 housing units and in Idaho, Ada County, which includes Boise, could add 11,200 units based on building permits.
Nationally births were slightly higher in 2024 than the year before, by about 1%, according to provisional federal numbers from the National Vital Statistics System within the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The fertility rate also increased slightly, but it remains below the “replacement level” needed to keep the population stable — 2.1 children for each woman over her lifetime.
All the increase nationally was in births to Hispanic and Asian mothers, with births continuing to decline for Black, American Indian and white mothers. Births to teenagers and women ages 20-24, in sharp decline since 2007, continued to drop last year, while births increased for women 25 and older.
The number of births dropped most in states struggling with stagnant population: falling about 4% in Louisiana, 3% in Mississippi, and 2% in New Mexico and New Hampshire. All those states had little or no population growth between mid-2023 and mid-2024, according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates.

Over the past six years, few public servants in North Carolina have had a bigger or more positive impact under more difficult circumstances than former State Board of Elections executive director Karen Brinson Bell. Despite woefully inadequate appropriations from the state legislature and relentless attacks from uninformed conspiracy theorists, Brinson Bell persevered, strengthened North Carolina elections and kept them among the nation’s most efficient and honestly run.
Unfortunately, those accomplishments were of little interest to the newly installed and hyper-partisan members of the board appointed by Republican state auditor Dave Boliek, who summarily fired Brinson Bell at their first meeting and refused to even allow her to deliver farewell remarks. Happily, Brinson Bell was kind enough join Newsline’s Rob Schofield this past week for a special extended conversation and in Part One of our chat, we explored some of the accomplishments from her term in office that she thinks will be the most impactful.
In Part Two, we turned our attention to some of the broader issues and challenges facing American elections – including the increasingly intense partisanship that led North Carolina GOP lawmakers to withhold election funding and, more recently, add seven new political appointees to the agency’s staff, and the unfortunate phenomenon of politicians spreading unfounded conspiracy theories and refusing to concede close elections.

State records indicate Jesse Husmann began working for Jefferson County as a full-time paramedic in October 2023. On Feb. 17, 2025, a hospital emergency room nurse allegedly reported to Ambulance Service Director Josh Hemminger that Husmann’s behavior that day was unusual.
Hemminger then spoke to one of Husmann’s co-workers about her behavior, and the co-worker allegedly reported Husmann seemed confused and didn’t know where certain things were located in the emergency room even though she frequently worked there, according to the records. The co-worker also is alleged to have reported that Husmann didn’t know how to get to the hospital, couldn’t sit still and had walked into a wall.
Hemminger then spoke with Husmann and allegedly observed that she could not sit still, and asked that she submit to drug test, the records show. Husmann agreed to do so and was allowed to drive herself to the testing site and then return to work. The next day, she was placed on paid administrative leave until the test results were produced.
On March 5, the lab allegedly faxed Hemminger the test results showing Husmann had tested positive for marijuana and amphetamines and that Husmann had not provided any information to explain the results. Husmann allegedly told Hemminger she was using marijuana to address a non-work injury and that she was taking a prescription medicine that would show up as amphetamines on a drug test, state records show. Husmann was immediately fired. She later applied for unemployment benefits, which led to a hearing before Administrative Law Judge Daniel Zeno.
Zeno recently ruled in Husmann’s favor and awarded her unemployment benefits, noting that Jefferson County “did not notify Ms. Husmann of the test results by certified mail return receipt” before firing her. As a result, Zeno found, the county could not use the results of the drug test as a basis for challenging her application for jobless benefits.



Other Iowans fired for alleged workplace misconduct 
Other Iowans whose unemployment cases were recently heard by an administrative law judge include:
— Sara Bergeson, who began working for the Ames Community School District in August 2022 as a full-time educational associate and was fired on April 4, 2025. Bergeson typically took her daily 30-minute, unpaid lunch breaks inside a classroom where she would sit at a table, set an alarm for the end of her break, and listen to music or sleep. On April 2, an employee sent district officials two photos of Bergeson showing her sitting in a chair in the classroom with her arms crossed, head back, leg propped on a table and eyes closed.
She was subsequently fired for sleeping on the job, with the district noting that she had been “written up” for sleeping on the job in April 2024. Administrative Law Judge Daniel Zeno ruled recently that Bergeson is entitled to jobless benefits, finding that even if one were to assume that Bergeson was sleeping when photographed, she was on an unpaid break at the time. “It is not misconduct for an employee to sleep during a break in a place where the employer authorizes an employee to take breaks,” Zeno ruled.
— Justin J. Haubrich, who began working for the Omara Law Office in February 2024 as a full-time paralegal and was fired in October 2024. The law office alleged Haubrich had been performing below expectations, had been insubordinate, and had become upset, slammed doors and used profanity in speaking to colleagues in the office.  At some point, the law office discovered Haubrich had been accessing, from his home, the employer’s security-camera system to watch two female colleagues at work.
When the employer confronted Haubrich, he allegedly admitted to the behavior, according to state records. In a subsequent meeting with partners of the law firm, Haubrich allegedly became upset and began yelling and arguing before telling one partner to “f— off” and leaving the building. He was fired that same day and subsequently collected $602 in jobless benefits. An administrative law judge ruled recently that Haubrich is not entitled to benefits and that he must repay the $602.
— Jordan S. Bates, who worked as a full-time care aide for Immanuel Pathways, a care program for the elderly, from March 2023 until she was fired in March 2025. Her dismissal was based on a finding that Bates had worked outside of the scope of her professional duties when she made a report to an animal-rescue agency regarding the welfare of animals living in the home of a client and the unsanitary conditions the client faced due to the amount of animal feces inside the home.
Bates made the complaint after a superior asked her to consult with an Iowa Department of Health and Human Services worker who, in turn, directed Bates to make the animal-welfare report. She was subsequently awarded unemployment benefits, with an administrative law judge ruling she had not committed any form of workplace misconduct.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ambulance.jpg,,,2025-05-26 11:05:46.244187

(Tracey Attlee)More than 80 years after he died in the attack on Pearl Harbor, John Connolly was finally laid to rest — not as an unknown in a mass grave, but as a naval officer in Arlington National Cemetery.
When the Navy first called to tell his daughter, Virginia Harbison, that her father’s remains had been identified, she hung up. At 91, living in assisted care in Texas, she could hardly believe it. It was her son, Bill Ingram, who called her back to share the news again. She was silent for so long that he had to ask if she was all right. “Bill,” she said, “I hadn’t thought about that for 60 years.”

She has lived the full life her father never had the chance to. In March, Ingram pushed his mother in her wheelchair to her father’s gravesite for the burial.
“They fold the flag in this very tight, nice triangle, and then with white gloves, the commanding officer comes and takes it and kneels down and hands it to my mother,” said Ingram, who lives in San Francisco. “It was incredible.”
On Dec. 7, 1941 during the attack on Pearl Harbor, 429 service members aboard the USS Oklahoma died. Horrifyingly, men trapped below deck after the ship capsized could be heard tapping out “SOS” in Morse code as the air supply dwindled. Though 32 men were rescued, the rest were tragically not reached in time. 
After the war ended, the remains were recovered and buried in the National Cemetery of the Pacific in Hawaii, too water damaged and commingled to be identified individually. There they remained for years until modern science caught up with historical tragedy. 
The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency disinterred the USS Oklahoma remains in 2015 to send to a DNA laboratory. Carrie LeGarde, a forensic archaeologist with the agency and project lead for the Oklahoma Project, said her team started the process by testing small pieces of bone for maternal line DNA. Overall, they inventoried 13,000 bones and took 4,900 DNA samples. For Connolly, identification was complicated. 
“We had several sequences that had multiple individuals, and that was actually the case with John Connolly, and part of why his identification occurred later in the project,” she said.

Since John Connolly was older than most of the men aboard the USS Oklahoma as one of the few officers on the ship and scheduled to retire just three weeks after the bombing, the team at DPAA relied on dental evidence in addition to DNA testing to confirm his identity. 
Connolly was born in Savannah in 1893 and joined the Navy in 1912. He served during World War I and was eventually promoted to a chief warrant officer. In 1941, his wife, Mary Connolly, and their two daughters, eight-year-old Virginia and six-year-old Helen were eagerly awaiting his return and retirement in Long Beach, California, when the Navy informed them he had died. 
Mary Connolly never remarried. 
“She was very sad all her life because she married at age 30 or 31 and her husband was away in the service, but was killed right before he was supposed to retire,” Ingram said. 
Connolly’s memory has been passed down through the generations.
“We’ve taken my family to Hawaii, and we went to the memorial and found the marker for his name,” Ingram said. 
Everything changed last year when Ingram got a call from the Navy. In a 200-page report, the Navy detailed the historical background, identification process and scientific evidence.
“With the research that was involved, both with historical research and medical research, there’s a lot of folks at DPAA that are involved,” Navy POW/MIA branch head Richard Jenkins said. “We as a service will explain that to the family, with the hopes of them feeling comfortable with the findings and showing them that it’s not just any set of remains, it’s actually going to be that person.”
  Seven sailors fire their guns three times in a salute in March 2025 at Arlington National Cemetery for the late John Connolly. (Tracey Attlee)
There’s a story that runs in Ingram’s family about his grandfather. A couple of years after World War II, a young man knocked on the family home and introduced himself to Virginia and Mary Connolly. He had been on the USS Oklahoma with John Connolly, he said, and when the ship was hit, Connolly pushed open a hatch and forced him out. Connolly had saved his life. 
In 1944, the Navy re-commissioned one of their ships as the USS John Connolly. Though his story was a tragic one — an officer who never returned home whose remains were left unknown — history has granted him a second chance at closure. Over eight decades later, he got the hero’s burial he deserved. 
“They did everything. They had a band. They played Taps. They fired the guns,” Ingram said. “Seven soldiers fired three times for a 21-gun salute.” 
A final sendoff at last.

(Photo by Tom Werner/Getty Images)In February, my health care provider reached out with some bad news — my annual mammogram had an “area of concern,” that required me to return for additional screening.
An abnormal test result is always terrifying, but somehow Oklahoma’s health care system made the uncertainty infinitely worse. I found out it would be 54 days between receiving my results and the first available appointment at Mercy’s renown breast center in Oklahoma City. That location had the ultrasound technology necessary to provide the specialized followup needed to determine if the unexplained masses were cancerous or benign.
Thinking the scheduler had made a mistake, I called the clinic directly. The woman who answered was shocked — shocked that I had gotten in that quickly. 
Usually, she told me, it takes longer.
So the agonizing wait for answers began.
To put this timeframe into perspective: It took so long that nearly half of Oklahoma’s four-month legislative session ticked by. Seven-figure pygmy gobies – tiny fish that live among coral in the Indian Ocean –  had almost lived an entire life cycle. Red foxes had completed gestation and given birth. People had applied for and received their U.S. passports.
That delay is probably why I found myself so irked earlier this month by Gov. Kevin Stitt’s decision to veto bipartisan legislation that aimed to increase women’s access to diagnostic mammogram testing. The bill, had Stitt signed it, would have required insurance companies to foot the bill for two additional tests. In short, it would have eliminated copays and deductibles.
The proposal passed overwhelmingly through both legislative chambers and seemed like an easy win for Stitt and his fellow Republicans trying to signal that they actually care about women’s health outcomes. 
After all, breast cancer is a disease that disproportionately affects women, and ours is a state where women die from the disease at higher rates than the national average. In Oklahoma, an estimated 22.4 per every 100,000 women die compared with 19.3 nationally, according to the National Cancer Institute. In rural McCurtain County, the death rate is a staggering 36.4 women per 100,000 – almost double the national rate.
The U.S. Preventative Services Task Force, which advocates for evidence-based medicine and prevention, notes that Black women are 40% more likely to die from the disease than their white counterparts, and that it is critical that patients “receive equitable and appropriate follow-up.” The task force recommends women have a biennial mammogram for over three decades — from age 40 until 74.
Breast cancer is a disease where the odds of surviving are significantly improved by early detection, so it boggles the mind that Stitt would reject legislation that removes a cost-barrier that might prevent Oklahomans from getting screened.
But with the stroke of a pen, our male governor demonstrated that he doesn’t understand — or even care about — the struggles we women face to access what should be a routine health care procedure. And, he showed that he’s fine with women being forced to disproportionately bear those testing costs. Because how many men do you know who pay for biennial mammograms?
And as icing on the already unsavory cake, Stitt vetoed this legislation authored by a lawmaker fighting breast cancer, experiencing first hand the struggles that Oklahomans face. 
In 2022, legislators passed a law requiring coverage of diagnostic mammograms, but Melissa Provenzano, the bill’s author, said access to mammogram machines depends on where you live. She also said that women report their insurers are pushing back on the copay protections despite the law.
In his veto message, Stitt wrote that he was “deeply sympathetic” to women who have bravely fought the disease. He noted that he was aware that early detection and access to care are critical priorities. But, Stitt said,the legislation “imposes new and costly mandates on private health insurance plans” that will raise premiums for “working families and small businesses.”
Stitt is clearly more sympathetic to health insurers who often charge “working families and small businesses” large monthly insurance premiums and then continue to collect even more from them in copays and deductibles.
Like most businesses, insurance companies aim to make money. It often takes legislative action to force them to waive copays or deductibles, which chip away at their profits.
It remains to be seen whether lawmakers will let Stitt’s veto stand. If every lawmaker who supported it initially stayed the course, they’d have the two-thirds of votes needed to override it.
While they’re mulling it over, perhaps they should consider that ours is a state that has some of the worst health outcomes in the country. Maybe it’s time to worry less about hurting insurers’ feelings, put on their big girl pants and champion policies that will make lifesaving testing easier to access and more affordable — for Oklahomans of any gender.
Because while the masses in my breast were determined to be benign, nobody should have to wait months for those answers or be required to pay for a doctor-recommended screening that could save her life.

One of North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein’s first acts upon assuming office earlier this year was to name a new Secretary of the state Department of Health and Human Services, and from the looks of things thus far, the person to whom he turned, Dr. Dev Sangvai, was a winning selection.
Since taking office, Sangvai — a family medicine practitioner and Duke University professor – has quickly hit the ground running and emerged as forceful voice for commonsense in the often rancorous world of health care policy.
Most recently Sangvai has spoken out publicly and energetically in opposition to the massive Medicaid and SNAP food assistance cuts working their way through Congress. And as Sangvai reminded NC Newsline, his concerns about the cuts are about more than mere empathy for struggling families – they’re also based on hard data which show the devastating ripple effects the cuts will have on North Carolina’s overall health and economic wellbeing.

In January, Disability Rights Mississippi and Jackson reached a settlement agreement establishing standards that JTRAN, Jackson’s transportation system, must continue to reach for in the coming months. Otherwise, the city could face further legal action from disability advocates. 
While it may be considered progress for the city, the conclusion of the lawsuit was not publicized earlier this year as the mayor ran unsuccessfully for reelection, though he generally touted improvements in JTRAN during the campaign. Materials from Mayor Chokwe Lumumba’s campaign highlight updates to JTRAN’s bus fleet, as well as securing more than $20 million in federal funds to improve Jackson’s transit system. 
Scott Crawford, the lead plaintiff in the 2008 lawsuit, which led to a 14 year-long consent decree, said the settlement agreement is a move in the right direction. 
“The notion that the consent decree could last forever is just not realistic. You can’t tie up a court system overseeing a transit system forever. That is not practical, and I’m the lead plaintiff,” said Crawford, JTRAN Paratransit Advisory Committee Chairperson. “You can’t have courts overseeing a system forever, so they needed it off the docket. That’s just a pragmatic fact of life. We had it in place for 14 years, and that’s a very long time.”
Those standards include ensuring that 95% of telephone hold times are not longer than three minutes and 99% are not longer than five minutes. It also states no more than 10 trip denials in a month, which occurs when JTRAN cannot provide a trip or when JTRAN offers a trip with a pick-up or drop-off time differing by more than 60 minutes from the requested time.
In addition, the settlement agreement focuses on the timeliness of passenger pickups, with at least 90% of all pickups occurring within the on-time pickup window, which is 30 minutes, and 95% of all pickups within 45 minutes.
“To be accurate and clear, we’ve only met that standard one month, so we’re not there yet. Nobody’s declaring victory. It’s a work in progress,” Crawford said.

Minutes from April’s JTRAN Paratransit Advisory Committee meeting provides data that shows trip cancellations were down in January and February. Excessive ride times were up, with a few rides lasting longer than 120 minutes. The settlement agreement says that the city shall not provide excessively long trips for more than 5% of paratransit trips in a month, and no trip should be longer than 120 minutes.
“We have been in the range of 78% to 85% (for on-time dropoffs) in the last several months. I hope we can get up to 90% for Paratransit on-time performance. That would be an acceptable level of timeliness when you’re trying to get to appointments,” he said. “If you’re the medical provider or you’re the employer, you really want your folks to be on time for their appointments and their jobs, so it matters.”
The city of Jackson contracted with MV Transportation to manage transportation services, including JTRAN bus drivers, in January of 2024. Last fall, the Amalgamated Transit Union, Local 1208, which represents the drivers, went on strike against MV Transportation due to concerns such as long hours, wrongful terminations and safer working conditions. The strike lasted two weeks. 
Christine Welch, deputy director for the Office of Transportation, said that one thing JTRAN needs now is more bus drivers.
“It’s across the board. Drivers,” Welch said. “Currently we have about 54, 55. The desired number is hopefully about 60 drivers.”
JTRAN’s buses are ADA accessible, she said, meaning that people with disabilities can ride fixed routes or paratransit. But paratransit comes with some limitations. 
“You have to first be certified for that service based on your medical disability,” she said. “It’s a door to door service, curb to curb. Our services operate within three-fourths of a mile of a fixed route.”
Crawford said that one way to ensure JTRAN meets the standards agreed to in the settlement is for the city to hire more bus operators and pay them a fair wage. 
MV Transportation’s current job listings for CDL drivers in Jackson come with a starting pay of about $16-an-hour. The city is also seeking an associate planner who will aid JTRAN in managing paratransit services.
“I think public transit is worth its weight in gold. I think we underpay our transit staff, and that would help. That’s one way to fix this, but trying to convince lawmakers is an uphill battle,” Crawford said. “These are professionals who are doing a stressful job, and they need to be paid like it.” 
Greta Martin, litigation director for Disability Rights Mississippi, said that the protection and advocacy organization will continue to monitor data that the city of Jackson provides to them on a monthly basis. 
“For every piece of data that we get from the city of Jackson, there is some kind of number that they have to stay within,” Martin said. “It’s kind of a wraparound situation that we have. We’re making sure that we keep an eye on the data, but we’re also trying to work with the city, knowing that they have their own limitations, but then we also want to be accountable to the community and understand what their perspective is as people that utilized the services.”
Martin said by ending the consent decree and reaching a settlement agreement, it allows the city and her organization to direct time and resources toward improving public transit and quality of life for people who have disabilities. 
“That was the point of filing the litigation to begin with, to hold them accountable for the services they should be providing people with disabilities in the city,” Martin said. “I hope it fosters a collaboration with the city so that not only will they lean upon us for these issues involving public transit, but also that they will lean upon us for making the city of Jackson more accessible as a whole.”
Martin has represented plaintiffs in the JTRAN lawsuit since she started at the legal advocacy organization seven years ago. A little over a year ago, the city hired Martin’s husband, Drew Martin, as its lead attorney. The plaintiff’s lawyer said she’s received more feedback from the city attorney’s office in the last year than at any other point in the litigation. 
She quipped that may be because “my husband sees my name on the email and says, ‘I better answer it.’”
“I’ll take my wins anywhere I can find them for people with disabilities,” Greta Martin said.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/19205814/JTRAN-1.jpg,,,2025-05-26 10:09:29.126790

Their beauty, wildlife and opportunities for adventures are a great gift to current and future Alaskans, as well as our many visitors.

Their beauty, wildlife and opportunities for adventures are a great gift to current and future Alaskans, as well as our many visitors. From Denali to Katmai to Glacier Bay, these special places help drive a thriving tourism economy and support reliable, made-in-Alaska jobs. Unfortunately, Alaska’s national parks and the economic benefits they bring are threatened by drastic staffing and budget cuts to the National Park Service. It was recently reported that the National Park Service Alaska Regional Office in Anchorage has lost an estimated one-third of its staff — more than 60 knowledgeable Alaskans — a result of downsizing the Department of Interior through pressured buyout tactics. And the federal administration has threatened additional cuts through mass firings.
Roughly 2 million people visited Alaska national parks in 2023, and more are expected this year. They spent $1.5 billion dollars and supported 23,000 jobs, according to the National Park Service. In Anchorage alone, 1 in 9 jobs is in tourism, Visit Anchorage has found. Across the country, one tax dollar invested in the Park Service returns $10 to the economy. 
But national parks don’t run themselves. People are needed to keep parks running, from park rangers to contracting experts, from educators who design the visitor center exhibits to biologists who make sure that park wildlife survive and thrive.
The Alaska Regional Office provides oversight and expertise to 24 national park sites across Alaska, covering more than 50 million acres of federal land. The scale and landscape of Alaska makes the Alaska Regional Office essential. Most Alaska national park sites only have one or two resource staff and limited capacity.  It doesn’t make financial sense for every park to have its own pilot and plane, geologist, or subsistence expert. The Regional Office provides support and expertise that serve all our parks.
At the Alaska Regional Office, cuts and consolidation programs have eliminated crucial positions, including the regional chief ranger overseeing law enforcement. Now there is only one staff member leading archaeology and cultural resource protection for all of Alaska’s national park sites, and just a handful of staff remain to work with Alaska Native tribes, whose culture, food security, and traditional ways of life should be respected by those parks.
The people who work in the National Park Service in Alaska are Alaskans. Their jobs bring important cash into our communities, and they are our friends and neighbors. The loss of Park Service jobs and the other federal land management agency jobs will hurt our economy and jeopardize the valuable resources of the parks. Without adequate staffing, park visitors may be at risk or at least disappointed. The tourism market is extremely competitive. It may not take too many bad experiences with deteriorating roads, dirty restrooms, inadequate information, disorganized commercial operations and absent wildlife to undermine one of the pillars of Alaska’s economy.
Sen. Lisa Murkowski has pushed hard to protect federal jobs in Alaska. In contrast, Rep. Nick Begich just voted for a $250 million cut to Park Service staff funding. We need our delegation to stand up for our national parks, our economy and our communities. It is not too late to keep our amazing national parks safe, accessible, sustainable, productive and world class.

Michelle Lujan Grisham,Julia Goldberg,,,,,https://sourcenm.com/2025/05/26/from-the-roundhouse-to-the-white-house-an-interview-with-nm-gov-michelle-lujan-grisham/,"Source New Mexico interviews New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham about public safety, threats to Medicaid and governing through Trump.","New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham in her office on the fourth floor of the state Capitol in May, 2025 (Julia Goldberg/Source NM)New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham still uses coffee left over from Gov. Susana Martinez’s administration, which she describes in less-than-flattering terms before offering some at the outset of this interview (we declined). She drank from a mug festooned with the New Mexico flag and noted that her staff had been mocking her all day for wearing metallic pants. Source’s extended interview, however, did not touch on fashion—of which we know zilch—but, instead, focused on the governor’s executive order deploying the National Guard to Albuquerque to help manage that city’s crime problems; threats to New Mexico’s Medicaid from the proposed budget recently approved by U.S. House Republicans; and governing during the Trump administration(s). Lujan Grisham began her second term as governor in 2023, and previously served three terms in the U.S. House of Representatives, representing the state’s 1st Congressional District, and as the state’s health secretary under former Gov. Bill Richardson. The governor’s Chief of Staff Daniel Schlegel and Communications Director Michael Coleman sat in the room during this interview, which has been edited for concision and clarity.
Source NM: Your front desk just received a call from someone who wants you to recall the National Guard from Albuquerque. Are you getting mixed reviews on that?
MLG: I don’t feel like we’ve gotten mixed reviews. I do think people are confused about what it is and maybe we can do a better job explaining it. We’ve previously sent the state police into Albuquerque in a number of ways and strategies, but I’m running out of state police to cover all of that additional work in areas where we’ve got growing risk. The Guard can do all of these administrative police activities [such as] dispatch. Some of them are a little more frontward facing: driving arrestees if they need medical attention, meeting them at the hospital so they can provide security. They can do security at the shelters, where we’ve got [the Albuquerque Police Department] and the [Bernalillo County Sheriff’s] office doing court security. All of that will be managed and directed by Guardsmen and women who were trained military police already, who were retrained about how APD and how the sheriff’s office handles those efforts. And then you have more police on the ground in the areas that need them. All [people are] going to see in a neighborhood is a sheriff’s vehicle with deputies and an APD vehicle [and] APD on cycles the way you would normally see that. I don’t think people quite understand that a tank and people in uniforms like soldiers are not coming into your neighborhoods under this administration. That’s not what we have ever proposed and it’s not something I’m interested in.
Has your stance on public safety changed during your tenure as governor? The New York Times has highlighted, more than once, that your positions have put you in conflict with some other Democrats.
I think maybe because it’s become such a lightning rod favorably to Republicans. But remember, I put 50 state police into the International District primarily, but all along that central corridor, in 2019. I have consistently moved them around and, I would argue, made them a little short staffed for the [Interstate 25] corridor, and then that [Interstate 40] intersection, because there are not enough police. [According to the governor’s office, the state police currently has 100 vacancies.]
We’re an interesting state for crime in a number of ways. High poverty states usually have more difficulties. We didn’t have any behavioral health [due to the dismantling of behavioral health services during Martinez’s administration]. Drug addiction is rampant, though that’s being, I think, attenuated. We’ve got some really good outcomes there, but it’s not gone by any stretch of the imagination. And that I-25/ I-40 connection is just not good for stopping crime. It’s where it moves. All those trucking stops. It’s one of the reasons Albuquerque gets hit so hard. So, I think I’ve been very consistent. I just have not gotten enough attention. And I think you can hear it in my voice. I think what they’re seeing shift is I’m a bit more frustrated about, ‘My gosh, how many more victims do we need?’
You said at the end of the legislative session you wanted a special session to address crime, juvenile crime in particular. Is that still a possibility?
It is still a possibility. We’ve been meeting with leadership staff. There’s more movement to be in a more productive place for a special session. But we’re not where we need to be and there’s no reason to call them and not have any effort. Plus, I don’t want to do three or four or five or six special sessions, as we see what rolls out from the feds, particularly in the next couple of days [this interview took place on May 21, prior to the U.S. House May 22 passage of the GOP budget bill]. And I think there’s widespread agreement by the Democratic leadership that we should adjust our priorities and our budgets to reflect whatever we need to do and can do in the short term to protect New Mexicans.
Do you have an ideal scenario of how the state would make up Medicaid funding shortfalls?
I think that the fact that we’ve got money in reserves…there are things that we can do. My pitch to the Legislature today—and of course, I haven’t seen what’s coming, although I have a pretty good idea—is we should try to sustain to the degree that we can for a year. And it’s really two [years] between now and when [the 2026 midterm elections] would take hold in Congress, but see if you can stem the closures of rural hospitals and healthcare clinics, and that we don’t lose any movement to hold onto OBGYNs, which is precarious. That’s my perspective today. It’s still a lot of money and we’d have to game it out. It could be as little as $1 billion that we’d have to come up with in healthcare. It could be as much as $3 billion and that’s before you get to education and the [Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program].
Would the strategy for addressing SNAP cuts be similar to Medicaid?
Yes, because you’ve got $1 billion that we get into the state for SNAP. They’re not eradicating it. These are radical cuts. It’s a little bit different and I don’t think people quite understand the nuance of it, but we could be on the hook for up to $300 million if the cuts, as we know them, were voted on today. I don’t think that’s going to happen, and I’m going to fight hard to prevent that from happening. I think I might be doing a call shortly to encourage voters of every persuasion all across the country: These cuts will change your communities as you know them, and people will get hurt and they will die. And when we have food prices as high as they are, and with all the tariff complications, then you have your food budget goes not nearly as far. So, we’d have to figure out SNAP. I’m not as worried, believe it or not, about education, but there are education cuts. There are impacts everywhere.
We haven’t had much success getting anything more than boiler plate out of the Public Education Department as it relates to the Trump administration’s orders about diversity/equity and inclusion to avoid funding cuts.
That makes me happy. And the reason it does is: We don’t discriminate in New Mexico. We’re also a minority-majority state. We think that when they do a blanket search for inclusion or equity or equality, they forget that that’s how we define rural investments. So, we’ve just provided that boilerplate language that we think meets the federal effort at changing what they believe are reverse-discrimination rules. I work hard to not tip the scales against New Mexicans. That department and others are going to respond to the feds as they’re required to, but we have been a little vanilla about, ‘We don’t violate any of those rules right now. Thank you so much for reminding us that there’s no discrimination allowed.’
But in my mind, what the federal government is after is different, right? They want to discriminate against people who have racial differences, gender differences, sexual orientation differences, religious differences. This is a state that’s proud about its inclusion and diversity, but we don’t discriminate, and we just have been saying so. And we’re going to continue to do that and continue to provide Attorney General [Raúl Torrez] with information that we think is harmful and illegal in the way in which the feds might approach any of these issues and see where they go in the courts. All of this is being tested, as you know, in the courts, and we’re doing well in terms of preliminary injunctions. But who knows where it goes? The bigger risk isn’t with these executive orders. The bigger risk is Congress’s action right now.
Do you support AG Torrez’ approach in joining various lawsuits against the Trump administration?
California or New York, collectively, have thousands of lawyers who can just pay attention to the federal lawsuits. [Torrez] doesn’t have that luxury, so he has to be—pardon the pun—judicious, and we certainly understand that. I totally respect that he makes decisions about which places where he’s out front more. But we’re participating robustly, and I have no doubt that he is identified as one of the leaders. We are one of the states with the most to lose, given our federal footprint here, and he’s out there doing it. You’re going to see New York and California and Illinois —the bigger states—get a lot of attention. But I know that our AG is robustly engaged, and I’m glad. I need him to be and he is.
You have not been particularly outspoken or making public speeches about the Trump administration.
Because I don’t know what it does. I don’t need New Mexicans to be targeted when I may not have all the things I need to protect you adequately. I mean, these people at Homeland Security are terrifying. The abandonment of our constitutional rights and due process is terrifying. Now, I don’t want New Mexicans to think that I’m not tough. You know you got to be tough to roll up like a burrito and sneak into the White House. I took on Trump in a very public phone call during [COVID-19], and basically said, ‘You are not telling the truth. You never tell the truth, and I will not let you create a situation where New Mexicans aren’t protected.’ Right after that, we got on as the last tiered state for [Personal Protective Equipment] and COVID vaccines and testing supplies. Now I got that reversed, but what if I hadn’t gotten that reversed and we couldn’t get any testing kits? That’s a big problem, and so I know what the risks are.
But Trump [in his first term] was navigating. Trump [in his second term] has people who will do whatever he asks them to do. This is a whole different agenda. They’ll have to come through me to get to you, but I’m not going to invite them to drive over here and get into a boxing match, particularly when the courts are doing, I think, fairly well in terms of saying, ‘wait a minute, this doesn’t seem right. You don’t have the authority.’ I’m more worried about the cuts than anything.
But let’s talk about the stuff that we have done. We have really strong privacy laws. They’re not getting access to our data. We aren’t providing any of that legally protected information and we aren’t going to do it. They ask for it all the time. You can expect a whole lot more in the 30-day session. You’ve seen us really strengthen reproductive laws. We’ll probably do a state [Emergency Medical Treatment & Labor Act] EMTALA statutory protection, [in case] the feds take that away for reproductive health.










I don't need New Mexicans to be targeted when I may not have all the things I need to protect you adequately.


– Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham


New Mexico plays an important role in the Trump administration’s immigration and deportation agenda, partly because there’s a new so-called militarized buffer zone on the state’s border. What is your take on that?
I don’t like it for the number of risks it introduces to an area that needs more security and support, not more risk. I’m also worried because now I don’t have direct access in that militarized zone either. We would do sometimes…well more than 100 humanitarian rescues in that part of the desert. New Mexico is very dangerous to cross, and they will leave you out there, those coyotes, to die. But I’m more worried about [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] [and] anything that begins to interfere with due process, rights and constitutional protections. Believe it or not, I invited any of the feds in Homeland Security: ‘You want to go after bad actors through the Organized Crime Commission? I’m in. By the book. By the law. Due process.’ No, they’re not interested. What they want is for me to authorize or support them in convincing local police, including the state police, to do ICE enforcement and I’m not doing that because I think it’s unconstitutional.
The Times also had a story last month about [Michigan Gov.] Gretchen Whitmer and other Democratic governors trying to cultivate some kind of relationship with the Trump administration. Is that what you’re doing?
I wouldn’t call it cultivating a relationship, but part of your job as a governor, you get what you get at the federal level. In the Biden administration, you might imagine that I had some very challenging conversations with [former Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack], who kept burning down stuff here without…providing notice or following the rules. In any administration, I have very terse, aggressive stances, conversations, debates and lawsuits against the federal government. I also have great relationships with certain departments on certain issues, and I think you have to do that.
I do think, frankly, if you can get in to see the president, you can actually get him to be more reasonable. He likes you to propose a deal. I have asked to meet with the White House recently about a number of issues, not the least of which is, they owe me money for [the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant] for the roads. I need them to be serious about public safety. They rejected what we thought was an easy proposal: If you know where someone is on a felony warrant, let’s go, let’s do it together. You’re involved in a in a big fentanyl drug bust? Let’s do it together. I got sort of squarely rejected because their priority is massive deportations. And I said, ‘No, thank you.’ That’s not a deal I’m willing to be engaged in.
We had another big issue I was trying to navigate with them…[which was Liquified Natural Gas]. I was just in Japan and Singapore, and we’re pitching clean LNG. We reduce the world’s carbon footprint if we’re using our LNG, and they can’t produce geothermal and solar and wind in Japan and Singapore. So, they’re going to be using LNG. So, I wanted to talk to the White House about that because they’re not pushing the western states [for energy projects]. They’re pushing one state, and I’ll bet you can guess which one.
[Reporter feebly offers incorrect guess]
No, Alaska. So, I’m going to Alaska next week because: Don’t have a conversation about my energy without me at the table. I couldn’t get in to see the president. I got in to see some very nice liaisons. We’re working on economic development, on introducing the states [to] green energy [and] to a number of other countries. Some of the best methane detection companies are in Japan, so I want them locating here. You don’t need a foe who says, [the energy economy is] only in Alaska. Gretchen and other [Democratic state governors] are doing their jobs. I’m not looking to curry favor with any president. I’m looking to represent New Mexico effectively.










I'm not looking to curry favor with any president. I'm looking to represent New Mexico effectively.

At a recent town Sen. Ben Ray Luján [D-N.M.] held, many attendees seemed to want a stronger response from Democrats. Some of them wanted Sen. Luján to go on the road with [Vermont Sen.] Bernie Sanders and [New York U.S. Rep.] Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. You’ve been in politics a long time: Are you critical of how Democrats are handling this current moment?
I don’t know that I’m critical. For me, the politics here don’t solve the fact that I have to figure out how to keep a rural hospital open. I’m going to tell you how I answered a question recently. A person said, I think, that they didn’t vote for Trump, but they’re Republican —this wasn’t in New Mexico —and they said, ‘I just can’t support this president. What do I tell my kids?’ As people were talking about it, somebody else said, ‘Well, but there’s two sides to Trump.’ And they talked about the nice sides. And I said, ‘No, there are not two sides.’
I have to do my job to get the federal government to apply its resources here…but I’m not going to stand up and support a person who openly lies, is vile and abhorrent and doesn’t seem to understand or care that he creates real risk and people are harmed. I respect the office of presidency. I respect the federal government. I respect all the branches, but I can’t accept that behavior by any person, and I won’t excuse it. So, I get that people are really pissed. I do. That’s the word. I’m really pissed about it my own self.
These tours, I hope, are aimed more at getting Democrats to realize they have real choices. But in those real choices, be careful that you don’t actually create the opposite, which is that we are electing extremists on either side of the political spectrum. Congress can’t run like that. It isn’t running like that. Congress is broken. And when Congress is broken, you have sweeping changes. You can’t govern. You need a little bit of everything. You need a body that can govern and deliver.
We have to be very clear about what we need in [the 2026 midterm elections]. We can never allow people who lie to us, who aim to hurt us and punish us, who use the office for retribution, elected into any office ever again. And we need to be open minded. Don’t let what you think is the perfect solution be the enemy of good overall.
I am going to go to some of these town halls with our delegation because I think people want to know, ‘what do you think, and what are you doing?’ And I do have an opinion, and I am doing stuff, and I think that could be helpful because people deserve elected leaders to have a conversation about where we find ourselves today.










I have to do my job to get the federal government to apply its resources here…but I'm not going to stand up and support a person who openly lies, is vile and abhorrent and doesn't seem to understand or care that he creates real risk and people are harmed.


– NM Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham


Are you sorry you’re ending your tenure as governor in this particular federal climate?
I am sorry about that, because I don’t think the world deserves someone as reckless as the current president. You know, it’s very nice to have a president or a president-elect ask you to think about being a cabinet secretary, and to ask you to be thought about as a vice president. That’s very flattering, but I think people made assumptions that I was really interested in pushing that, and these two [gestures at Schlegel and Coleman] can tell you unequivocally: I wasn’t leaving. I like this job, and I don’t feel like I’m done. I feel like I need six more years. And I tease that I lost three with COVID-19 and fires.
But I’m also really proud: No state in the nation has our cradle to career system. We did far better economically than anyone thought we could. I’ve always believed that we could punch above our weight class. I think COVID really stalled out a lot of our educational potential progress [but] I think we’re going to get there.
What about the Children, Youth and Families Department?
CYFD is one of those really hard ones. We need to do more. We have had some missteps. There’s no question about that, but nobody wants to work there. And the more that you try to take it over, the less that’s the case. We have some ideas that didn’t get over the finish line that we can implement anyway, and we’re going to do what the Legislature told us to do in a robust and cooperative manner. I wish it was an easier road to hoe. Maybe on a happier note, at CYFD, 200 or 300 foster kids and families were at the residence on Saturday, and a lot of them have suggestions about what we need to do better, which is great, and we’re doing it. We are going to do a massive adoption effort and get lots of families all ready to go, and that’s really good news and exciting for these families and kids.
Your term doesn’t end for more than a year and a half, but do you know what you’re doing next?
I don’t quite know. I do want to work, and I think folks are expecting me to look at healthcare some more and look at energy. We really are a powerhouse, and we have the ability to do a lot more transition and green work, not just in the country, but around the world. I’m excited about that. [New Mexico is hosting the Western Governors Association in June] and we’re going to have a robust conversation. You cannot power the eastern United States without the western states. We’ll make a pitch. New Mexico can do a lot of different things.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/MLG2-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-26 09:12:14.923558

(Win McNamee/Getty Images)Our soldiers have endured unimaginable hardships and faced profound challenges, testing the very limits of human resilience and strength. When they arrive home, the trauma many veterans experience abroad comes with them, and the toll it takes on their mental health can be devastating without intervention. Veterans will face additional challenges if promises of massive U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs layoffs around the country and in Idaho go forward.
Our veterans deserve better.
Several Americans have protested cuts to the VA. Here in Boise at the VA campus, local community members have supported those protests, demonstrating just how important VA services are to Idaho veterans. Our communities are concerned about access to behavioral health care for our veterans and with good cause. Military veterans are 57.3% more likely to die by suicide than non-veteran U.S. adults. This stark statistic reveals the harsh reality that our service members face, particularly those living in rural areas like many veterans do in Idaho. Our state has one of the highest rates of rural military populations, and it has a higher rate of VA reliance for health care than the national average.
The Trump administration aims to cut 83,000 jobs from Veterans Affairs. The VA is tasked with caring for our veterans who return home, it provides crucial medical and behavioral health services including telehealth services for our rural vets. At the Boise VA campus alone, we may lose 300 employees, and this is a VA that already lacks staff for the vets it serves.
Veterans and active-duty military personnel face unique challenges. Reintegrating into civilian life, Adverse Childhood Experiences (or ACEs) and post-traumatic stress all can contribute to poor mental health outcomes for our nation’s heroes.
Many veterans shy away from seeking help due to stigma, barriers to care created by the isolation of rural living, or a lack of access to services, but the need is real. Veterans in rural areas often feel most comfortable accessing these services through the VA, a community that knows what they have gone through, specifically telehealth options which can allow access to behavioral health professionals working from home.
Current changes by the administration have put into question these services, leaving our veterans uncertain about where they might find care in the future.
In Idaho, one of the most pressing issues connected with this uncertainty is the disproportionate suicide rates among service members. Research consistently shows that veterans, especially those living in remote, rural regions — a common way of life in Idaho — are at greater risk of suicide. A lack of accessible mental health services can prevent veterans in need from receiving vital care.
Furthermore, for patients at risk of suicide continuity of care, including consistent follow-ups with trusted health care providers is critical. Any threat to losing that continuity of care poses a significant danger, it is well known to be a key component of successful strategies to prevent suicide.
Veterans health care provided by the VA removes barriers to care associated with insurance accessibility and affordability, and in many cases has been offered with telehealth options. However, any health services required outside of the VA falls on the service members to cover. If the VA’s behavioral health services are disrupted in a way that jeopardizes telehealth for rural veterans, it not only creates a crisis in continuity of care but also establishes a significant barrier to access for many low-income veterans.


For more information on the Idaho Association of Free and Charitable Clinics, go to www.idahoafcc.org.


For veterans who are unable to access mental health services through the VA, safety net options such as the Idaho free and charitable clinics are crucial. These clinics are closely monitoring the situation, hoping for continued care and support for our nation’s heroes.
In the meantime, they can provide health care to any Idahoan without health insurance including our former service members. To ensure the wellbeing of our nation’s heroes, we must advocate for health care and behavioral health care as a basic human need, and work to improve and protect access to these services.
Veterans and service members deserve the support and care necessary to thrive, both during and after their service.

When the Navy first called to tell his daughter, Virginia Harbison, that her father’s remains had been identified, she hung up. At 91, living in assisted care in Texas, she could hardly believe it. It was her son, Bill Ingram, who called her back to share the news again. She was silent for so long that he had to ask if she was all right. “Bill,” she said, “I hadn’t thought about that for 60 years.”
She has lived the full life her father never had the chance to. In March, Ingram pushed his mother in her wheelchair to her father’s gravesite for the burial.
“They fold the flag in this very tight, nice triangle, and then with white gloves, the commanding officer comes and takes it and kneels down and hands it to my mother,” said Ingram, who lives in San Francisco. “It was incredible.”

On Dec. 7, 1941 during the attack on Pearl Harbor, 429 service members aboard the USS Oklahoma died. Horrifyingly, men trapped below deck after the ship capsized could be heard tapping out “SOS” in Morse code as the air supply dwindled. Though 32 men were rescued, the rest were tragically not reached in time.
After the war ended, the remains were recovered and buried in the National Cemetery of the Pacific in Hawaii, too water damaged and commingled to be identified individually. There they remained for years until modern science caught up with historical tragedy.
The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency disinterred the USS Oklahoma remains in 2015 to send to a DNA laboratory. Carrie LeGarde, a forensic archaeologist with the agency and project lead for the Oklahoma Project, said her team started the process by testing small pieces of bone for maternal line DNA. Overall, they inventoried 13,000 bones and took 4,900 DNA samples. For Connolly, identification was complicated.
“We had several sequences that had multiple individuals, and that was actually the case with John Connolly, and part of why his identification occurred later in the project,” she said.

Since John Connolly was older than most of the men aboard the USS Oklahoma as one of the few officers on the ship and scheduled to retire just three weeks after the bombing, the team at DPAA relied on dental evidence in addition to DNA testing to confirm his identity.
Connolly was born in Savannah in 1893 and joined the Navy in 1912. He served during World War I and was eventually promoted to a chief warrant officer. In 1941, his wife, Mary Connolly, and their two daughters, eight-year-old Virginia and six-year-old Helen were eagerly awaiting his return and retirement in Long Beach, California, when the Navy informed them he had died.
Mary Connolly never remarried.
“She was very sad all her life because she married at age 30 or 31 and her husband was away in the service, but was killed right before he was supposed to retire,” Ingram said.
Connolly’s memory has been passed down through the generations.
“We’ve taken my family to Hawaii, and we went to the memorial and found the marker for his name,” Ingram said.
Everything changed last year when Ingram got a call from the Navy. In a 200-page report, the Navy detailed the historical background, identification process and scientific evidence.

“With the research that was involved, both with historical research and medical research, there’s a lot of folks at DPAA that are involved,” Navy POW/MIA branch head Richard Jenkins said. “We as a service will explain that to the family, with the hopes of them feeling comfortable with the findings and showing them that it’s not just any set of remains, it’s actually going to be that person.”
There’s a story that runs in Ingram’s family about his grandfather. A couple of years after World War II, a young man knocked on the family home and introduced himself to Virginia and Mary Connolly. He had been on the USS Oklahoma with John Connolly, he said, and when the ship was hit, Connolly pushed open a hatch and forced him out. Connolly had saved his life.
In 1944, the Navy re-commissioned one of their ships as the USS John Connolly. Though his story was a tragic one – an officer who never returned home whose remains were left unknown – history has granted him a second chance at closure. Over eight decades later, he got the hero’s burial he deserved.
“They did everything. They had a band. They played Taps. They fired the guns,” Ingram said. “Seven soldiers fired three times for a 21-gun salute.”
A final sendoff at last.

,New Jersey Monitor,2025-05-26 12:00:30+00:00,New Jersey Monitor,The Canadians no longer visit down the shore — but why’d they come here in the first place?,Jen A. Miller,,,,,https://newjerseymonitor.com/2025/05/26/the-canadians-no-longer-visit-down-the-shore-but-whyd-they-come-here-in-the-first-place/,Canadians used to be regular visitors to the Jersey Shore — but a poor economy up north and more recent hostility from the U.S. changed that.,"Avalon Campground in Cape May Court House was a top destination for Canadians who were regular summer visitors to the Jersey Shore starting in the 1970s. (Beach photo courtesy of the Greater Wildwoods Tourism Improvement and Development Authority)Last week while in Avalon, I stopped at the Cape May County Habitat for Humanity to look for deck furniture. I didn’t find any, but while looking through used books and sofa sectionals, I found a mug featuring a maple leaf. “Eh?” it also read in an equally bold red.
A Canadian mug in a South Jersey Shore second-hand store might seem like an oddity, but it’s becoming an artifact of another time and a signifier of the once-strong-but-now-fraying relationship between this part of New Jersey and Canada.
According to Statistics Canada, Canadian car trips into the United States this March are down almost 32% compared to March of last year. Things don’t look better for the summer either. According to a New York Times analysis, summer plane ticket sales from Canada to the U.S. are down 21%.
If this winter’s dip in Canadian snowbirds flying to Florida (and selling their Florida properties) is any indication, the Jersey Shore, particularly Cape May County, could see a similar drop. 
But in all the “will they or won’t they” coverage I’ve seen about the issue this year, I noticed one thing left out: why Canadians — in particular French Canadians — came here in the first place. Like the drive from Quebec to Wildwood, it’s a long and sometimes winding journey. 
A Canadian solution to an American problem
In the 1950s and 1960s, South Jersey Shore towns were in trouble.
Where they were once the only place people could go to escape stifling summer heat, the advent of air conditioning and swimming pools meant that relief could be found close to home instead — no long train or car ride required. 
Atlantic City turned to gambling. Cape May County? French Canadians. In 1970, Quebec legislated a two-week holiday for all construction workers for the end of July, a move that rippled out beyond the industry, with many residents of the province also taking that block of time off for summer vacation. Les Quebecois were also, theoretically, one day’s drive away, so starting in 1968, the county pitched them on better beaches, warmer water, and cheap accommodations in motels and rooming houses in Wildwood and in campgrounds that lined Route 9 just inland of beach towns like Sea Isle, Avalon, Stone Harbor, and the Wildwoods. 
In 1970, Cape May County opened a tourism office in downtown Montreal to further bind the regions. In 1973, a tourism official told The New York Times that they spent 75% of its promotional budget to attract Canadians. 
By the mid-1970s, the Canadians had taken over. Motels in the Wildwoods gave themselves names like Canadian and Quebec Motel, and venues booked Canadian stars like singer, radio, and television host Michel Louvain and Lousie-Marie Houde, a.k.a. Mademoiselle Quebec. In 1977, Atlantic City hosted Quebec Day to thank their Canadian visitors, with a flag raising, cocktail party, concert, and fashion show featuring Quebec-based artists. 
“Two weeks after the Fourth of July, cars were backed out all the way to Route 9 to see if we had campsites,” said Lenny Catanoso, 74, who until last year owned Avalon Campground in Cape May Court House with his sister Marlene. Their parents opened the business in 1967, and they were teenagers working there when the influx of Canadians started coming in. 
For part of July, “every car in town was Canadian. I haven’t seen anything like it,” said Larry Lillo, 77, Wildwood Historical Society secretary and owner of the Holly Beach Train Depot.
Lillo has also held a gamut of jobs during his lifetime in Wildwood, including ice cream salesman, lifeguard, and firefighter.
“It wasn’t just the mother and father and the kids. It was the grandmother, aunts, and uncles. The whole gang would come down and stay in apartment houses here,” he said.
I saw it too, as a kid who spent all of her summers in the 1980s and 1990s in Avalon Campground. While my family’s summer place is now in Avalon proper, we were there then for the same reasons as the Canadians: It was more affordable than on-island accommodations and offered more things to do for large family groups that might include parents and kids but also grandparents, cousins, and that guy who isn’t really your uncle but that’s what you call him. 
For the last two weeks of July and the first two weeks of August, 75% of the campground’s bookings were French Canadians, according to Lenny Cataonoso. You could see it — and hear it. The U.S., New Jersey, and Canadian flags all flew at the campground pools (where, yes, you could usually tell who was Canadian by their penchant for Speedo bathing suits). When it came time for me to pick a language to study in middle and then high school, I picked French, not because I had young girl dreams of Paris, but because I thought it would help me get a summer job down the shore when I was old enough to do so.
Currency, COVID, and conflict take a toll
I never got the chance. By the time I was old enough to work, the Canadian dollar plummeted in value, and the parade of Quebec license plates coming down the shore just about stopped. Marlene Catanoso, 72, remembers her father working the phones, offering regular Canadian visitors half-price tent spots. The Cape May County Montreal office closed in 1995. 
The relationship hasn’t entirely died out, though. Gen X and Millenial Canadians come back so their kids can have the same kind of magical Jersey Shore experience they had when they were younger. Cape May County still has a French language website and Facebook and Instagram accounts, and the county tourism department has a public relations consultant focusing on Quebec and the Toronto region of Ottawa. Before the pandemic, about 8% of Cape May County visitors were from Quebec. 
Marlene Catanoso said that older Canadian visitors stopped coming to their campground during the first Trump term, but COVID had a much bigger impact.
“For two years, we had a campground that was half empty,” she said.
It wasn’t just that the Canadian border was closed, but accommodations in the area shifted to attract locals who didn’t want to travel either. To cope, Avalon Campground converted sites that once had bare-bones amenities with tent campers in mind and upgraded them with sewer, water, and better power, in order to accommodate RVs, campers, and mobile homes — and charging for it.
Diane Weiland of Cape May County’s tourism department insisted that other factors, like the value of the Canadian dollar and a stagnant Canadian economy, are playing a bigger role in keeping the Canadians up north this summer than political discontent (though she did note that the Canadian Automobile Association has declined to run their ads; and Canadian news outlets won’t be covering U.S. destinations this year). But she believes the region will be OK, as local business owners have said that American travelers have been picking up Canadian cancellations. 
So, as the unofficial opening of the summer begins, and more restaurants, bakeries, bike shops, and arcades open for the season, we don’t know what will happen. But it’s hard to see how this more than half-century relationship can repaired, at least during this administration, when the president insists that Canada is going to be the 51st state, pushes punitive tariffs on Canadian goods at who knows what whim, and eggs on the imprisonment of foreign travelers for things like a visa mix up, translation mistake or having tattoo equipment. If I were Canadian, I wouldn’t come here. Heck, I’m an American with a beach house and don’t know if I want to be here this summer. I guess we’ll see, eh?

Especially in California.
“We never felt homeownership was in our cards. But we did it!” Julia Whitnall said. “We’re extremely happy.”
The couple moved May 16 to a $509,000 two-bedroom house in Ripon, east of San Francisco in the Central Valley region.
It wasn’t easy. Despite a relatively high combined income of $140,000 from their nearby jobs, they had to compromise on size and take on extra work at summer camps to pull it off. Then they had to exercise patience as the sellers struggled to find a new home.
High interest rates and high prices in a still-competitive housing market continue to make it tough for first-time buyers, even those with good but moderate incomes.
On a national level, households making $75,000 to $100,000 — typical of teachers, nurses and skilled trades workers in many states — face a daunting lack of homes they can afford. That’s according to new research by the National Association of Realtors and Realtor.com based on listings in March of this year compared with 2024. However, the numbers showed an encouraging 20% increase in homes for sale, affordable or not.
Despite more houses for sale, those moderate-income buyers — which the report called “middle- and upper-middle-income buyers” — are much more hard-pressed to find an affordable home than they were in 2019, when almost half the homes on the market were affordable to them. This year they can afford only 21.2% of homes on the market — a slight improvement compared with 20.8% in 2024, according to the report.
It also found that a few states are improving in affordability for people in the $75,000-to-$100,000 income range. But many states are not.
The largest affordability gaps are in California, Hawaii, Idaho, Massachusetts and Montana, where such households can afford fewer than 12% of houses on the market. By contrast, they could afford about half the houses for sale in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Ohio and West Virginia.
There’s progress in states that are adding more housing at moderate price points: Arizona, Colorado, Delaware, Florida and Utah, according to the Realtors report.

 Balanced markets

Nationwide, to get home markets back in line with moderate-income families, the United States needs 416,000 more homes for sale at or below $255,000, according to the report.
“In many places, we’re still seeing a huge mismatch between income levels and what’s available to buy for moderate-income families,” said Nadia Evangelou, the National Association of Realtors’ senior economist and director of real estate research.
“We are no longer in crisis mode, but we are still very far from where we need to be. We can’t fix it overnight. It will take years,” Evangelou said.
Heather, who asked not to share her last name for privacy reasons, said she can’t even think of buying a house near her job on Long Island, New York. She makes more than $100,000 as a registered nurse and her family makes $170,000 with her husband’s job in building maintenance. But $4,400 in rent and $2,000 in monthly day care costs for three children have them living paycheck to paycheck.
“We can’t even afford a small car repair, let alone a mortgage in our hometown” of Ronkonkoma in Suffolk County, Heather said. Their jobs exposed her and her husband to risks in the pandemic that her neighbors avoided with remote work, she said. But she now feels like she’s in worse shape financially than she was in 2019 and considers moving away.
“All of our hard work feels like it was for nothing,” Heather said. “It’s disheartening that we can’t afford to live where we grew up, but that’s the reality we are facing.”
Some states can still be a refuge of affordability.
Ashley and Tristan Jonas bought a $252,000 house in northwest Ohio after three years of getting shut out by higher or all-cash offers. Ashley Jonas, 32, trained as a teacher but now works in skilled trades as a project coordinator for a countertop company, and the couple makes about $140,000 with Tristan Jonas’ job as a computer programmer.
“We happened to hit the market at the right time in 2025,” Ashley Jonas said. “We bid on this house just as [President Donald] Trump was announcing tariffs. I think a lot of people were holding their coin purses. We weren’t.”
 Help for teachers

Teachers, who generally make less than nurses or trades workers, are particularly squeezed. Some states, facing teacher shortages in local schools, are working to raise pay. And increasingly, some schools and hospitals are providing housing to lure more teachers and nurses.
“We lose so many teachers because they can’t find housing here,” said Autumn Rivera, a 20-year teaching veteran and 2022 Colorado Teacher of the Year. Despite her experience and credentials, Rivera said she can’t contemplate buying even a townhouse in the rural resort town of Glenwood Springs, where she teaches.
Prices for those townhouses now start in the $700,000 range, more than twice what they were when she last considered buying in 2019. Rivera feels lucky to have a reasonable rent by sharing a home with its owner, but many teachers in her Roaring Fork Schools need the 117 apartments provided by the district with affordable rent, she said. The district hopes the apartments will allow teachers to save up for a home; it has also built 14 houses for staff with Habitat for Humanity and Holy Cross Energy.
One way to make homebuying more feasible for teachers is to pay them more — a strategy that paid off for New Mexico, one of the few bright spots in a different report on teachers’ inability to afford housing, which was published this month by the National Council on Teacher Quality, a research and advocacy group.
Beginning teachers in Albuquerque saw a 60% increase in pay between 2019 and 2025, which fell just short of a 65% jump in home prices, according to the report. The report credited a state law that raised teacher salaries, including starting pay, by $10,000.
“We’re dealing with the issue of teachers being able to live in the communities where they’re actually working,” said state Rep. Joy Garratt, a Democrat who sponsored a new law, signed in April, that sets higher minimum salaries for teachers effective July 1.
Detroit schools also gave teachers with advanced degrees a pay boost of up to 50% since 2019, about the same increase as home prices, according to the report from the National Council on Teacher Quality. Albuquerque and Detroit are on the report’s list of most affordable places for beginning teachers to live.
But nationally, on average, experienced teachers who started in 2019 are less able to afford a home now than when they began, according to the report.
“Teacher pay has gone up 24% in the last five years, which some might say is solid growth, and yet the increase in house for purchase has gone up 47%,” said Heather Peske, the organization’s president.
“Housing prices are critical to being able to attract and keep great teachers,” Peske said. “People will be leaving the profession trying to find something that pays enough for housing. And bottom line, kids won’t get as good an education.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Housing_RondaChurchill_012-aerial-vista-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-26 08:03:40.271589

A bus boycott began in Tallahassee, Florida, after Florida A&M students Wilhelmina Jakes and Carrie Patterson refused to give up their seats to white passengers. Police charged them with “placing themselves in a position to incite a riot.” 
After their arrest, the student body president, Broadus Harley, called for a meeting of the 2,300 students. They voted to boycott the buses, leading to two temporary shutdowns of the bus company. The police arrested 26 people in the protests. 
The Rev. C.K. Steele helped form the Inter-Civic Council, which created a car pool system for African Americans that city leaders attacked as an “illegal” business, leading to the arrest of Steele and others. He shot back to their opponents, “I would rather walk in dignity than ride in humiliation.” 
Council leaders were arrested and charged with operating an “illegal car pool.” Steele, Jakes and Patterson had crosses burned outside their homes. On Jan. 3, 1957, a federal judge ruled bus segregation laws unconstitutional. Four days later, Tallahassee’s city commission repealed its segregation clause.

(Stock photo by Peter Unger/Getty Images)Memorial Day is a time to set aside our differences and join together in remembering and thanking those brave souls who gave their last full measure for their fellow Americans. They deserve that honor even for serving in what some thought to be an ill-advised conflict. Vietnam turned out to be such a war, but that cannot take away from the fact that the 58,220 service personnel who died in that war were answering the call of their country and doing it well.
On Memorial Day, we think of the almost 1,355,000 service personnel who have perished in the nation’s conflicts, starting with the 70,000 who died in the Revolutionary War. Since then, about 655,000 died on both sides of the Civil War. The death toll in World War I was 116,516 and 406,399 died in World War II. The vicious and almost forgotten Korean War saw 36,574 deaths. After Vietnam, 2,325 died in the War in Afghanistan and 4,492 in the Iraq War. May they all rest in peace.
But there are others we should hold in our hearts in addition to those who died in the war theaters. War has a way of inflicting mortal injuries that only take their toll on veterans after the guns are silenced. They include illnesses caused by exposure to toxins, like poisonous gas in WWI, Agent Orange in Vietnam and burn pit fumes in the Gulf War, Afghanistan and Iraq. Those toxins have resulted in untold deaths from a variety of cancers and other diseases. They are not counted on the official death tallies, but they nevertheless are directly attributable to combat conditions.
Many veterans have experienced health problems attributable to wartime conditions or know of others who have. It has been estimated that about 300,000 Vietnam veterans have died because of exposure to Agent Orange. The late Dan Eismann, my colleague of 12 years on the Idaho Supreme Court, received substantial exposure to Agent Orange during two tours in Vietnam. While on the Court, he developed non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and metastatic melanoma, passing away with honor last year. I was also exposed during my Vietnam service and developed pancreatic cancer in 2017. With surgery, chemo and a great deal of luck, I’ve been cured.
More recently, about 60,000 veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars are suffering and dying from medical ailments caused by exposure to toxins emanating from burn pits used to destroy all sorts of trash. Congress finally passed the PACT Act in 2022 to provide the necessary medical care, but the Act has not been funded for the current fiscal year. That is a serious breach of the country’s duty to those veterans.
There are many other serious problems that our veteran community faces on an all-too-frequent basis, including mental health issues, chronic substance abuse, suicide, traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder. There is obviously a lot of intermingling of these problems, but they present serious issues for many veterans.
While we can only honor the memories of the veterans who died in war zones, everyone concerned about our living veterans can take action to address problems presently confronting them. That could help to prevent future war-related deaths. When we see  veterans in distress, we can reach out to them, provide a voice of caring and make a referral to a helpline for expert assistance.
Everyone can provide a service to our community of living veterans by speaking out on their behalf in public. We should inform members of our Congressional delegation, as well as state and local leaders, that we expect them to advocate for preserving and protecting veterans and the benefits they have rightfully earned. The message must be that we will not put up with massive cuts of medical and support staffing at VA medical facilities. The lives and health of our veteran population must not be sacrificed based on unsupported claims of wasteful spending in veterans programs.
Our Senators and Congressmen should take aggressive action to maintain the current level of VA spending and to ensure funding of the PACT Act in the current budget fight. Funding must be restored for important programs designed to halt the war-related deaths of our veterans, including lifesaving cancer trials, mental health care, and suicide prevention. These essential programs, along with many others, must be restored, stabilized and adequately funded, in order to address war-related injuries and illnesses in our veteran population. They deserve nothing less.
On Memorial Day, May 26, let’s remember, honor and mourn those gallant Americans who gave their lives in service to this great country. We should also pay tribute to the veterans who died off of the battlefield because of war-related causes. And let’s resolve to do our utmost to prevent future loss of life for that veteran population.

In April 2025, the Supreme Court heard arguments about whether the nation’s first religious charter school could open in Oklahoma. The St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School would have been funded by taxpayer money but run by a local archdiocese and diocese. Several justices appeared open to the idea during questioning, leading some analysts to predict a win for the school.
They were proved wrong on May 22, 2025, when the court blocked St. Isidore. The one-sentence, unsigned order did not indicate how individual justices had voted, nor why, simply declaring it was a split 4-4 decision that leaves in place the Oklahoma Supreme Court’s ruling against the school. Justice Amy Coney Barrett recused herself from the case. Her former employer, the University of Notre Dame, runs a law clinic representing the school’s supporters.
Ever since the proposed school started making headlines, attention has focused on religion. Critics warned a decision in the school’s favor could allow government dollars to directly fund faith-based charter schools nationwide. In part, the justices had to decide whether the First Amendment’s prohibition on government establishing religion applies to charter schools.
But the answer to that question is part of an even bigger issue: Are charters really public in the first place?
The Supreme Court’s order applies only to Oklahoma, so similar cases attempting to open religious charter schools may emerge down the road. As two professors who study education law, we believe future court decisions could impact more than issues of religion and state, determining what basic rights students and teachers do or don’t have at charter schools.
 Dueling arguments

In June 2023, the Oklahoma Statewide Virtual Charter School Board approved St. Isidore’s application to open as an online K-12 school. The following year, however, the Oklahoma high court ruled that the proposal was unconstitutional. The justices concluded that charter schools are public under state law, and that the First Amendment’s establishment clause forbids public schools from being religious. The court also found that a religious charter school would violate Oklahoma’s constitution, which specifically forbids public money from benefiting religious organizations.
On appeal, the charter school claimed that charter schools are private, and so the U.S. Constitution’s establishment clause does not apply.
Moreover, St. Isidore argued that if charter schools are private, the state’s prohibition on religious charters violates the First Amendment’s free exercise clause, which bars the government from limiting “the free exercise” of religion. Previous Supreme Court cases have found that states cannot prevent private religious entities from participating in generally available government programs solely because they are religious.
In other words, while St. Isidore’s critics argued that opening a religious charter school would violate the First Amendment, its supporters claimed the exact opposite: that forbidding religious charter schools would violate the First Amendment.
 Are charters public?

The question of whether an institution is public or private turns on a legal concept known as the “state action doctrine.” This principle provides that the government must follow the Constitution, while private entities do not have to. For example, unlike students in public schools, students in private schools do not have the constitutional right to due process for suspensions and expulsions – procedures to ensure fairness before taking disciplinary action.
Charter schools have some characteristics of both public and private institutions. Like traditional public schools, they are government-funded, free and open to all students. However, like private schools, they are free from many laws that apply to public schools, and they are independently run.
Because of charters’ hybrid nature, courts have had a hard time determining whether they should be considered public for legal purposes. Many charter schools are overseen by private corporations with privately appointed boards, and it is unclear whether these private entities are state actors. Two federal circuit courts have reached different conclusions.
In Caviness v. Horizon Learning Center, a case from 2010, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit held that an Arizona charter school corporation was not a state actor for employment purposes. Therefore, the board did not have to provide a teacher due process before firing him. The court reasoned that the corporation was a private actor that contracted with the state to provide educational services.
In contrast, the 4th Circuit ruled in 2022 that a North Carolina charter school board was a state actor under the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. In this case, Peltier v. Charter Day School, students challenged the dress code requirement that female students wear skirts because they were considered “fragile vessels.”
The court first reasoned that the board was a state actor because North Carolina had delegated its constitutional duty to provide education. The court observed that the charter school’s dress code was an inappropriate sex-based classification, and that school officials engaged in harmful gender stereotyping, violating the equal protection clause.
If the Supreme Court had sided with St. Isidore – as many analysts thought was likely – then all private charter corporations might have been considered nonstate actors for the purposes of religion.
But the stakes are even greater than that. State action involves more than just religion. Indeed, teachers and students in private schools do not have the constitutional rights related to free speech, search and seizure, due process and equal protection. In other words, if charter schools are not considered “state actors,” charter students and teachers may eventually shed constitutional rights “at the schoolhouse gate.”
 Amtrak: An alternate route?

When courts have held that charter schools are not public in state law, some legislatures have made changes to categorize them as public. For example, California passed a law to clarify that charter school students have the same due process rights as traditional public school students after a court ruled otherwise.
Likewise, we believe states looking to clear up charter schools’ ambiguous state actor status under the Constitution can amend their laws. As we explain in a recent legal article, a 1995 Supreme Court case involving Amtrak illustrates how this can be done.
Lebron v. National Railroad Passenger Corporation arose when Amtrak rejected a billboard ad for being political. The advertiser sued, arguing that the corporation had violated his First Amendment right to free speech. Since private organizations are not required to protect free speech rights, the case hinged on whether Amtrak qualified as a government agency.
The court ruled in the plaintiff’s favor, reasoning that Amtrak was a government actor because it was created by special law, served important governmental objectives and its board members were appointed by the government.
Courts have applied this ruling in other instances. For example, the 10th Circuit ruled in 2016 that the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children was a governmental agency and therefore was required to abide by the Fourth Amendment’s protection from unreasonable search and seizure.
Since the Supreme Court did not release any reasoning for its order, we do not know how the justices viewed the “government actor” question in the case from Oklahoma. That said, we believe charter schools fail the test set out in the Amtrak decision. Charter schools do serve the governmental purpose of providing educational choice for students. However, charter school corporations are not created by special law. They also fall short because most have independent boards instead of members who are appointed and removed by government officials.
However, we would argue that states can amend their laws to comply with Lebron’s standard, ensuring that charter schools are public or state actors for constitutional purposes.

Most people will not need to apply.","The Summer EBT program provides an extra infusion of funds for food over the summer when children are out of school and do not have access to reduced price or free breakfast and lunch. This is the second year the program, federally known as SUN Bucks, is offered to eligible families.
Connecticut is one of 38 states, along with several tribal nations and U.S. territories, participating in SUN Bucks this year. Through the program, families receive a one-time benefit of $120 per child to spend on food. Around 300,000 children in Connecticut are expected to be served by the initiative this year.
Do I need to enroll? 
According to Daniel Giacomi, the director of program oversight and grant administration at the Department of Social Services (DSS), most families will not have to apply but rather will be automatically enrolled in the program. That includes children between 5 and 18 years old who receive SNAP benefits or Temporary Family Assistance, are on HUSKY A with an income at or below 185% of the federal poverty line, and children who have applied for the national school lunch program at their school and were determined eligible for the 2024-25 school year. In all, DSS says that 97% of recipients will be automatically enrolled.
If your child does not fall into one of those categories but your household income is less than 185% of the federal poverty line, you can apply for the program by visiting this link, starting in June. DSS says enrollment is not yet available because they are still making enhancements to the application.
When will benefits begin? 
Benefits will be added to EBT cards at the end of June or the beginning of July, but a precise date has not yet been confirmed, according to DSS. While last year the benefits were delayed after Connecticut agencies failed to effectively coordinate the launch of the program, Giacomi said that he did not anticipate a similar snafu this summer.
“We took the lessons learned from last year, and the hiccups that came along with it, to minimize the repeating of the same issue, so at this time, we don’t foresee any issues in being able to distribute the benefits on time,” he said.
What can the money be used for? 
Similar to the SNAP program, the money can only be used to buy food and can’t be used on prepared food. It can’t be used at restaurants, but it can be used for food from the grocery store or farmer’s market, and to buy plants that are used to grow food.
There are also a number of farmer’s markets throughout the state that offer SNAP doubling, so that $20 worth of produce can be purchased for 10 SNAP dollars, for example. 
Why is the program needed? 
During the summer months, children who rely on reduced price or free meals at school suddenly lose that source of food. The Summer EBT program was created by Congress in 2022 and is operated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to bridge that gap.
“We know that kids are home. We know obviously kids are hungry. Having two children myself, they eat more than I could possibly have ever imagined that small children would eat,” Giacomi said. “So having any amount, you know, having any funding to be able to lessen the burden upon their families is worthwhile and is something that we’ll do everything in our power to be able to continue and to operate as efficiently as possible.”
Will federal cuts impact the program? 
While Congress is currently debating a tax bill that could cut SNAP benefits by about 30%, Giacomi said it’s still unclear whether the Summer EBT program will be impacted.
“We’re taking this year as it comes. We’ve received approval to operate the program, so that’s how we’re proceeding,” he said. “But obviously we’re in communications with our federal partners, both at the USDA as well as our congressional delegation, to determine whether there would be any operational challenges in future years.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2024_0709_THM_EBTsalesign-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-26 08:03:40.271589

Memorial Day is a day of remembrance for those who made the ultimate sacrifice for this country. But this year, a gray cloud hangs over the occasion.
Since Jan. 20, we’ve witnessed a clear and coordinated effort to erase the contributions of many service members who died defending the very freedoms we hold dear, an attempt to ease the discomfort that comes with confronting hard truths about our nation’s history. The reality is simple: Americans of all backgrounds have long played a significant role in securing the liberties that define this country.

During my 22 years of active federal service, I proudly served six combat tours, from Kosovo to Iraq to Afghanistan. I carry the weight of every deployment.
In Iraq, 2003, as a noncommissioned officer, I witnessed a young African American father killed in action. He never got to see his daughter take her first steps, graduate or walk down the aisle. That same sorrow followed me to Afghanistan in 2016, as a senior enlisted advisor in Kabul, conducting a ramp ceremony for a Caucasian American 18-year-old recent high school graduate killed in action. He had his whole life ahead of him, but laid it down so that young women and children in Afghanistan might have a better life.
Like so many before me, service members have sacrificed, endured and stood firm in defense of the values America claims to uphold. Throughout history, African American veterans have fought with honor, on foreign battlefields and here at home. Many gave their lives in service, generation after generation, and now their contributions are starting to be ignored, sacrifices buried under systemic neglect, literally being erased from military records, including  at Arlington National Cemetery and at service academies.

This country was built on the ideals of liberty, equality and the pursuit of happiness, principles that have too often been denied to many veterans. For generations, service men and women have laid down their lives for this country, in the hope that their children might one day inherit the full promise of the American Dream.

As Memorial Day becomes more associated with the start of summer than with solemn remembrance, I urge you to pause. Reflect on the lives lost to make our freedom possible, especially those who never returned home, whose families were left to grieve in a country that too often denied them the very rights their loved ones died to protect.
It is deeply disappointing to see individuals in positions of influence and power show such disregard for the lives lost in defense of this nation. When Memorial Day is politicized or dismissed, it dishonors every man and woman who gave all.
This holiday is more than symbolic. It is a sacred testament to sacrifice, service and the enduring legacy of groups like the Tuskegee Airmen, who helped change the course of World War II, even as they faced discrimination at home.
Amid both domestic turmoil and international uncertainty, understand this: the unrelenting sacrifice of any veteran, including African American veterans, helped build the superpower that America is today. There is no freedom, no liberty, no pursuit of happiness without those who came before us and gave everything they had.
Let us remember them, not just with words, but with the dignity and recognition they earned.

It is in knowing each other that we will come to find ways to care about our common humanity.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Alis Headlam: Inclusion Week and Gov. Phil Scott.","This commentary is by Alis Headlam of Rutland.Gov. Phil Scott of Vermont proclaimed the second week in May as Inclusion Week for the fifth year in a row. Although the week has already gone by, his message should resonate with every Vermonter. His post on Facebook reminded us that “All of us are part of the story of America, those seeking liberty and fundamental freedoms of speech, religions and equal rights that no other country can provide.” We are all a part of the human family that contributes not only to our small state and to the country, but to the world. According to comments made on Facebook after his speech was posted it is clear that some people do not clearly understand or accept the premise that inclusion is important. It will take time to help everyone understand that the concept is not a threat to any individual, but rather a way of looking forward towards justice and fairness for all. It is important that we recognize the fact that although we accept and welcome each other, there are differences that must be met with certain parameters. Inclusion does not imply equality in all aspects of our lives but rather equity. We don’t all need the same medicine if we are not ill. We don’t all need the exact same education if we are going to perform the various tasks needed to keep our communities thriving. The similarity is that we all have the same basic needs. We all need to nourish ourselves both body and mind. We need to live in safety that includes shelter and sufficient nourishment for our bodies. It means that with equity we seek to meet the needs of everyone, but also understand that we have different needs depending on our circumstances.Some of us will be teachers. Others will be plumbers or electricians. Some people provide services while others will act as administrators. No matter what road we take in life we all make a difference. Gov. Scott said, “Vermont must continue to be a welcoming place for all people by protecting civil rights, opposing hate, discrimination and bigotry whenever and wherever it shows up to improve the lives of all Vermonters.”Justice for all of us means that we have certain laws to obey. Laws that are passed by our legislators both at the national and state levels of government, not by an executive branch. In our system of checks and balances the Legislature proposes the laws and passes them, and then they are certified by our executive branch — or should that not happen, the Legislature can override the executive branch.The executive branch can issue proclamations and executive orders which are not laws. There is no legal way to enforce these wishes. But our leaders give us guidance that we can all abide by if we choose. So when Gov. Scott issued a proclamation for inclusion it is not a law that we must abide by. Rather it is a strong statement of what should guide our lives.Asked what the plan is to execute this proclamation, the answer is obvious. It is up to each of us to follow his advice as best we can. He says, “I hope you’ll take time to get to know your neighbors, learn about a culture or a tradition that is not your own.” It is in knowing each other that we will come to find ways to care about our common humanity. We don’t have to agree on everything. We don’t even have to like each other, but we should try to understand each other so that we can live peaceably.It is only by making this a priority in our lives that we will find the way to live with all of our neighbors in a peaceful existence. World peace is possible, but it will take the entire human family to make it happen. Read the story on VTDigger here:  Alis Headlam: Inclusion Week and Gov.

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Eve O. Schaub: Why we turned our hayfield into an art protest.","This commentary is by Eve O. Schaub of Pawlet. She and her husband Stephen create artworks under the name EveNSteve. Their Hayfield Art Gallery is free and open to the public every day, dawn to dusk.My husband and I are artists, and for the last five years we’ve been putting up a free outdoor art exhibit in the hayfield across the street from our house in Pawlet, as a way to express gratitude to our community.This spring, like other years, we were formulating a plan for a new show, but as the news of 2025 kept rolling in, we felt an urgency to address the rapidly shifting landscape in the world of the arts. We wanted to create a space to pose and contemplate what is happening.Consequently, this year, instead of a mixed media display of photographs with hand painted text, we have a 32-foot artwork in the hayfield that simply reads “WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU DEFUND THE ARTS?” The other four scaffoldings that normally exhibit artworks are all painted black.READ MORE
The arts help us make sense of the world. In fact, during the pandemic, this is why we felt so strongly — as art venues and public spaces were closing, and shows and events were all being cancelled one after another — that we needed to find alternative venues for people to experience art. This is how the Hayfield Art Gallery was born.At first, we literally had no idea what we were doing. Would the artwork last? Would the frameworks hold up over time? Would people just hate it? What if, after investing all the time and expense, we ourselves deemed it a failure, which of course happens in art all the time?We built one artwork, a black and white photograph of a woman in an orchard, 12 feet long and painted into it words prompted by our Covid-19 experience: “My heart is very big. Sometimes I wonder if it is big enough.”Thankfully not only did we like it, but our neighbors did too. Horns honked and hands waved as cars drove down our road. People learned about our project and came from far and wide to see it, some getting out of their cars and walking the field. During a very dark time, we had found a way to create some light.We kept going, adding additional scaffoldings, becoming more ambitious. We had a conversation with our town zoning administrator to explain why this free outdoor art display did not violate Vermont’s billboard ban. The town ultimately agreed with our argument and the artworks remained, ultimately becoming a revolving annual exhibition open to all.The days of the pandemic are now, thankfully, behind us. During that time, we all found reason to turn to the creative arts to help make sense of the world, to find hope, distraction, solace. Movies, songs, podcasts, books, poetry, art of all kinds took on a renewed significance.The recent efforts to defund the arts represent a different kind of dark time. The current administration is proposing to eliminate the National Endowment for the Arts. Drastic NEA cuts have already affected Vermont institutions as varied as the Vermont Symphony Orchestra, the Flynn Theater and the Governor’s Institutes of Vermont.It’s important to note that the NEA is one of the largest arts funders in the U.S., yet it is also one of the smallest federal agencies. It does a tremendous amount of good with very little.Last year each taxpayer paid less than one dollar to support the NEA, and its entire budget represented about 0.003% of the federal budget. The NEA brings concerts, readings, performances and arts education to the entire country, including underserved, impoverished and rural communities, all for less than the cost of a cup of coffee.Our show for 2025 sincerely asks the question: What happens when we defund the arts? But it also asks it rhetorically, because the surrounding blank canvases represent one answer: when you defund the arts you are left with darkness.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Eve O.

[…]","Black men depart Duluth’s Union Station for St. Paul to join Twin Cities draftees for the journey to the segregated Camp Dodge. (Photo courtesy of University of Minnesota Duluth, Kathryn A. Martin Library, Northeast Minnesota Historical Collections) When I was young my grandfather told me that he emigrated from Austria-Hungary as a teenager in 1907 to avoid being drafted into the army of the Habsburg Empire. Like many Europeans, he was trying to avoid the big war that seemed to be coming. As it turned out, migrating to Chicago was not enough. In 1917, the United States declared war on Germany and conscripted men to fight in Europe, requiring all men 21 to 30 to register. My grandfather showed up on June 5, 1917, the national registration day.
According to family lore, he would have done anything, even broken his arm, to avoid being drafted. Fortunately, his draft board exempted him because he was married and had a 4-year-old son. Unfortunately, his wife died in November 1918, a victim of the influenza pandemic that spread across the country largely through the army’s huge training camps. My grandfather’s experience was my first glimpse of the wrenching impact of World War I on individual Americans.
People “make their own history,” Karl Marx observed, “but they do not make it just as they please.” We are born into a specific set of geographic, social, cultural and economic circumstances that open opportunities, at least for some, but also puts limits on individual lives — limits that for many are stark and brutal. The impact of world-changing events on individuals comes into sharp focus during times of massive social upheaval, like periods of invasion or total mobilization for war. Leo Tolstoy famously demonstrated this in “War and Peace.” Once Napoleon decided to invade Russia with a huge army, the lives of every Russian in his path would never be the same. A century later, Vasily Grossman, another great Russian writer, wrote two massive novels showing how Hitler’s army, even larger than Napoleon’s army, trampled on the personal life of every Soviet citizen, particularly those of Jewish ancestry.
The impact of World War I on Europeans needs no introduction. The armies of the belligerent states suffered more than 30 million casualties, of which about 10 million were fatalities from combat or disease. The wounded were often permanently disabled or horribly disfigured. Millions of civilians also perished, often the victims of war crimes. Postwar Europe was a continent of mourners, especially the 3 million war widows.  Personal lives were thrown up for grabs by the collapse of the Russian, German, Habsburg and Ottoman empires. Even victorious countries like Britain and France limped into the 1920s in debt and clinging precariously to their empires. The stage was set for fascism, which also came to have a profound impact on individual lives.
Americans also experienced serious disruptions in daily life during World War I, even though our country entered the war late and suffered only a small fraction of the casualties sustained by Europeans. Citizens faced a massive propaganda campaign to build support for the war, as well as food rationing, aggressive Liberty Bond drives, government-sanctioned vigilantism, prosecutions under the Espionage Act for dissenting speech, and of course, the drafting of young men, many of whom had recently arrived from Europe to escape conscription. There was no avoiding the war even half a world away from the Western Front.
When the conflagration broke out in Europe in 1914, Americans were living through a wrenching transition to a new, centralized form of industrial capitalism, dominated by corporations rather than entrepreneurs, where “trusts” held near monopolistic power in banking, mining, steel and transport. Industrialization stimulated relocation, immigrants continued arriving from Europe, and Black Americans began the Great Migration to northern cities. Economic inequality reached astounding levels, with men like Carnegie and Rockefeller rich beyond belief while millions lived at subsistence levels.
As passionately divided as Americans were about the war, it was hardly the only source of tension. The United States entered World War I during a contentious period when farmer and worker militancy challenged entrenched economic power, the elected mayors in several cities (including Minneapolis) were Socialist Party members, Black Americans struggled against Jim Crow and white nationalist terrorism, women were in their final surge toward suffrage, and millions campaigned for “prohibition” in the belief that alcohol was a fundamental source of the country’s problems. As David Kennedy wrote in his indispensable book on the American home front, “Americans went to war in 1917 not only against Germans in the fields of France but against each other at home.” What happened on the home front, he continued, “was a deadly serious contest to determine the consequences of the crisis for the character of American economic, social and political life.”
Over a century later many find it hard to believe that relatively peaceful and well-mannered Minnesota was an explosive hotspot in this “war at home.” Exploring Minnesota’s history from the beginning of the European war in August 1914 through the 1920 election provides a unique vantage point from which to assess the impact of World War I on American society. Those years in Minnesota were marked by bitter political polarization, ethnic intolerance, a flagrant disregard for democratic norms and the rule of law by business leaders, and intense conflicts sometimes punctuated by violence.
This was partly the result of timing. The controversial declaration of war on Germany coincided with an intense period of battles between Minnesota’s grain milling industry, mining conglomerate, big banks, and railroads on the one hand — and the organizations representing farmers and workers on the other. The success of the Nonpartisan League in organizing farmers and the influence of the Industrial Workers of the World among miners and loggers sent shock waves through the state’s business elite. As a result, ongoing economic, social, and political conflicts merged with new ones generated by the war and the draft.
 Soon, editors of German-language newspapers were investigated as possible spies, farmers arguing for market equity were attacked as “disloyal,” and workers trying to get union contracts were branded as “Bolsheviks.”
As war was declared, the Legislature created the Minnesota Commission of Public Safety  and gave it nearly unlimited power until the armistice. The commission consisted of Gov. Joseph Burnquist, the attorney general, and five men appointed by the governor, mostly conservative businessmen. John McGee became the dominant personality in this powerful body, and until the war ended, the most powerful man in Minnesota. McGee was the oldest son of Irish immigrant farmers, and he became a successful Minneapolis lawyer representing banks and railroads. He set a tone of uncompromising nationalism and maintained that anything less than 100% support for the war effort was treasonous. McGee focused on building the Home Guard, an armed force available to enforce “loyalty,” curb the growing political power of angry farmers, and block trade unions trying to break through employers’ resistance to collective bargaining.
For McGee, the most dangerously disloyal man in the state was Charles A. Lindbergh, Sr., the Little Falls lawyer who in 1914 was elected to his fifth consecutive term in the United States Congress. Lindbergh, the only son of Swedish immigrant farmers, had emerged as a leader of the Minnesota Republican Party’s progressive wing. While in Congress, he fought a determined battle to limit the power of Wall Street bankers. Lindbergh’s radical populism put him in the same camp as Robert La Follette, known as “Fighting Bob,” the fiery senator from Wisconsin. Having left Congress, Lindbergh accepted the nomination of the Nonpartisan League to run against Joseph Burnquist in the 1918 Republican primary for governor. Their electoral battle was the climax of the war for the Minnesota home front, and the most violent campaign in Minnesota history. Lindbergh is one of the most important figures in Minnesota political history but largely forgotten, eclipsed by the fame of his aviator son who bears his name.
* * *
Although Minnesota’s home front experience was the product of a particular confluence of events and personalities, the issues it raises have not been left safely in the past. 
Studying this history can alert us to how extreme economic inequality can warp democracy, how patriotism can be used to suppress fundamental rights, how politicians can harness racism and anti-immigrant nationalism to further their agendas, and how the wealthy sometimes resort to authoritarianism when their power is threatened.  Hopefully exploring these years of sharp polarization can help us navigate our own perilous times.

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)On September 11, 2001, I was 29 years old, deployed to Kuwait as an Army Aviator in the Indiana National Guard. I was flying a mission in a UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter over northern Kuwait near the Iraq border when I learned that terrorists had attacked our homeland. 
I remember the flood of emotions that hit me — shock, sorrow, anger, and an overwhelming sense of resolve. In that moment, the mission became personal. The idea of service, which had always been central to my life, was no longer just about duty — it became about defending the people I loved, the nation I swore to protect, and the ideals that define us as Americans.
As a soldier and an American, I am humbled by the memory of those we honor on Memorial Day. From the beaches of Normandy to the jungles of Vietnam, from the fields of Gettysburg to the deserts of Iraq, generations of selfless men and women have laid down their lives so that we may enjoy the blessings of freedom, security, and peace.
Every headstone at Arlington National Cemetery, every name etched on a memorial wall, tells the unique sacrifice of a Soldier, Sailor, Airman, or Marine who gave everything in the service of something greater than themselves, and we will never forget them.
The origins of Memorial Day trace back to the Civil War, a conflict so brutal it claimed more American lives than any war in our history. After the devastation brought about by that war, America committed to the idea of remembering and honoring our fallen. That brought about many of today’s memorials, including the Soldiers and Sailors Monument in downtown Indianapolis. Over the nearly 250 years of our nation, what remains constant is the character of those who wear the uniform: courage, sacrifice, and a love of country that transcends self-interest. 
Whenever I am in Washington D.C., I find time to stop by the Lincoln Memorial and take a moment to reflect by reading the Gettysburg Address etched in the memorial wall. I always walk away humbled and with a renewed sense of purpose because of the words President Lincoln spoke that day.
“The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us, the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us—that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion—that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain.”
As we approach this long weekend and the unofficial start of summer, let us remember the true meaning of Memorial Day — to honor the cost of freedom and remember those who paid it for us. This weekend is for the people who never made it home, whose lives were cut short in the pursuit of liberty.
To my fellow service members, past and present, I say thank you. To the Gold Star families, know that your loved ones will never be forgotten — their sacrifice lives on in the heart of this nation. And to all Americans: may we honor the fallen not just today, but every day, through our commitment to the values they fought and died to protect.
Honoring their names means more than offering gratitude. It means carrying forward the ideals they believed in — freedom, justice, and unity — and understanding that the fight to preserve them is never over.

(Provided/Robert Smalls Monument Commission)When Rob Edwards started telling people he was writing a comic book about South Carolina Civil War hero Robert Smalls, he’d have to accompany it with an explanation of Smalls’ life.
Now, when he mentions his graphic novel, many people already know Smalls’ story, he said.
“It’s really fantastic to see,” said Edwards, a writer and producer who lives in Los Angeles. “And no one is more deserving than Capt. Smalls himself.”
Edwards’ upcoming graphic novel “DEFIANT,” which he hopes to turn into a feature-length film, is part of a broader effort to educate the public about a story that had been largely forgotten, including Smalls’ escape from slavery on a commandeered Confederate ship and his time as a state legislator and five-term congressman.
South Carolina legislators are planning to commemorate Smalls’ life with a statue across from the Statehouse visitors’ entrance, the first on the grounds recognizing an individual Black person.
A joint committee of senators and representatives approved plans for the statue May 8, on the last day of the 2025 session. The vote by the State House Committee affirmed the design and location chosen by the commission created by a bill the Legislature approved unanimously last year.

“He’s probably one of the greatest South Carolinians of all time, as is well documented,” former Sen. Gerald Malloy, who is in charge of fundraising to build the statue, said during a recent trip to scout out the Statehouse grounds with the statue’s artist.
Edwards, who has written movies for titans such as Disney and Marvel, didn’t know Smalls’ story either when a friend first brought him the idea.
The friend had seen a post on X, formerly Twitter, asking why of all the movies being made none had featured the action-packed story of Smalls’ escape on the U.S.S. Planter in Charleston and ensuing life in politics.
That intrigued Edwards, who started researching Smalls’ life.
He got in touch with Michael B. Moore, Smalls’ great-great-grandson, as well as a Harvard historian who studied Smalls, trying to learn as much as possible.
It was crucial to get the details of Smalls’ incredible feats correct, Edwards said.
“Because it’s true and because it’s phenomenal, (the story) has to reflect reality or else somebody’s going to say, ‘Oh, come on, that didn’t happen,’” Edwards said.
The part of Smalls’ story people tend to know is what Edwards calls “the heist:” Under cover of night, Smalls stole the Confederate ship he piloted and, using Confederate disguises and hand signals, delivered himself, his family and other enslaved workers to freedom in Union waters.
Exciting as that story is, Edwards was drawn to Smalls’ life as a free man. He became the first Black man to pilot ships for the U.S. Navy, used his prize money for capturing the steamship he hijacked to buy the same mansion where he had been enslaved, and became a renowned politician.
During Reconstruction, Smalls was part of the majority-Black convention of delegates who wrote the state’s 1868 constitution, which promised free education to all children and voting rights to all men. He served in the state House and Senate before winning a seat in Congress in 1874.
In 1895, Smalls was again a delegate for a convention — this time majority white — to rewrite the state constitution. He pleaded for a constitution guaranteeing “free and honest” elections while recognizing the convention was meant to disenfranchise Black voters.
“That was the stuff that was really amazing to me,” Edwards said.
Edwards, whose writing credits include Disney’s “The Princess and the Frog” and Marvel’s “Captain America: Brave New World,” wanted to turn the story into a movie, but he knew selling the script might prove difficult.
He wanted proof that this was a story people cared about.
So, he and a team launched a fundraising campaign through Legion M, a company that lets people back projects they want to see happen. The plan was to start with the comic book to drum up more interest, then set sights on a movie.
Almost as soon as the campaign was posted, donations started flooding in, Edwards said. As of Friday, the project had raised about $160,000.
That was enough to get the comic book started, Edwards said. Once that’s out in the world, his hope is that it will be compelling enough to prove people want to see a live-action movie about Smalls’ life.
In the meantime, comic books appeal to teenagers, which is the audience Edwards most wants to reach.
“The thing that I would most want to tell a 16-year-old is, ‘Hey, there was this guy, he was born a slave, and look what he did,’” Edwards said. “If he can do that, then think of the things you can do.”

Edwards partnered with illustrators Nikolas Draper-Ivey, who created the art that accompanies the soundtrack for Marvel’s “Black Panther,” and Ray-Anthony Height, a longtime comic book artist who has created illustrations for Marvel and Star Wars comics.
The comic book, titled “DEFIANT: The Story of Robert Smalls,” is set for release June 19, which is also Juneteenth, a federal holiday celebrating the day slaves in Texas learned they were free in 1865.
The release date has become especially significant after the Defense Intelligence Agency ordered a pause in events related to Juneteenth, alongside other holidays, following an executive order banning diversity, equity and inclusion programs earlier this year, Edwards said.
“We’re in this really interesting time when I think inspirational stories like ‘DEFIANT’ are really, really important,” Edwards said. “I’m thrilled that we’re able to be part of the Juneteenth celebration with this book.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-08-at-3.50.25-PM-1024x581.png,,,2025-05-26 08:03:40.271589

(Photo by Tracey Attlee)More than 80 years after he died in the attack on Pearl Harbor, John Connolly was finally laid to rest – not as an unknown in a mass grave, but as a naval officer in Arlington National Cemetery.
When the Navy first called to tell his daughter, Virginia Harbison, that her father’s remains had been identified, she hung up. At 91, living in assisted care in Texas, she could hardly believe it. It was her son, Bill Ingram, who called her back to share the news again. She was silent for so long that he had to ask if she was all right. “Bill,” she said, “I hadn’t thought about that for 60 years.”
She has lived the full life her father never had the chance to. In March, Ingram pushed his mother in her wheelchair to her father’s gravesite for the burial.
“They fold the flag in this very tight, nice triangle, and then with white gloves, the commanding officer comes and takes it and kneels down and hands it to my mother,” said Ingram, who lives in San Francisco. “It was incredible.”
On Dec. 7, 1941 during the attack on Pearl Harbor, 429 service members aboard the USS Oklahoma died. Horrifyingly, men trapped below deck after the ship capsized could be heard tapping out “SOS” in Morse code as the air supply dwindled. Though 32 men were rescued, the rest were tragically not reached in time.
After the war ended, the remains were recovered and buried in the National Cemetery of the Pacific in Hawaii, too water damaged and commingled to be identified individually. There they remained for years until modern science caught up with historical tragedy.
The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency disinterred the USS Oklahoma remains in 2015 to send to a DNA laboratory. Carrie LeGarde, a forensic archaeologist with the agency and project lead for the Oklahoma Project, said her team started the process by testing small pieces of bone for maternal line DNA. Overall, they inventoried 13,000 bones and took 4,900 DNA samples. For Connolly, identification was complicated.
“We had several sequences that had multiple individuals, and that was actually the case with John Connolly, and part of why his identification occurred later in the project,” she said.

Since John Connolly was older than most of the men aboard the USS Oklahoma as one of the few officers on the ship and scheduled to retire just three weeks after the bombing, the team at DPAA relied on dental evidence in addition to DNA testing to confirm his identity.
Connolly was born in Savannah in 1893 and joined the Navy in 1912. He served during World War I and was eventually promoted to a chief warrant officer. In 1941, his wife, Mary Connolly, and their two daughters, eight-year-old Virginia and six-year-old Helen were eagerly awaiting his return and retirement in Long Beach, California, when the Navy informed them he had died.
Mary Connolly never remarried.
“She was very sad all her life because she married at age 30 or 31 and her husband was away in the service, but was killed right before he was supposed to retire,” Ingram said.
Connolly’s memory has been passed down through the generations.
“We’ve taken my family to Hawaii, and we went to the memorial and found the marker for his name,” Ingram said.
Everything changed last year when Ingram got a call from the Navy. In a 200-page report, the Navy detailed the historical background, identification process and scientific evidence.
“With the research that was involved, both with historical research and medical research, there’s a lot of folks at DPAA that are involved,” Navy POW/MIA branch head Richard Jenkins said. “We as a service will explain that to the family, with the hopes of them feeling comfortable with the findings and showing them that it’s not just any set of remains, it’s actually going to be that person.”

There’s a story that runs in Ingram’s family about his grandfather. A couple of years after World War II, a young man knocked on the family home and introduced himself to Virginia and Mary Connolly. He had been on the USS Oklahoma with John Connolly, he said, and when the ship was hit, Connolly pushed open a hatch and forced him out. Connolly had saved his life.
In 1944, the Navy re-commissioned one of their ships as the USS John Connolly. Though his story was a tragic one – an officer who never returned home whose remains were left unknown – history has granted him a second chance at closure. Over eight decades later, he got the hero’s burial he deserved.
“They did everything. They had a band. They played Taps. They fired the guns,” Ingram said. “Seven soldiers fired three times for a 21-gun salute.”
A final sendoff at last.

But he could have been after putting a loaded pistol in his mouth in October 2021. 
Terhune had been deployed to Iraq in 2003 and again in 2007. His second two-year mission was cut short in 2008 after he contracted leishmaniasis, which causes skin lesions and ulcers, and was taken to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center for treatment.

He retired from the Reserves in 2015 after 24 years in service and later from his position at the Tallahassee Fire Department, where he worked for 28 years, in 2020.
The separations, though, left him feeling lost.
“I couldn’t take it anymore and the hurt, the pain,” Terhune said. “It was physical pain that was eating my gut, my kidneys. I walked out on my back patio with my pistol, and after my wife and kids went to school, and I said, ‘I’m done. I just can’t do this.’ 
“And as I’m sticking the pistol in my mouth, Tyler, my friend who killed himself the year prior, was standing in front of me. And call it divine intervention or whatever. But he said, ‘Doc, stop. You have so much more to give.’ And then he was gone,” Terhuune recalled in an interview.
“It was almost like a slap in the face. And I thought it was the bullet honestly going through my head — that’s what I thought the slap in the face was. But I realized at that point. I said, ‘What am I doing?’ And I threw the gun down.”
Terhune immediately called a counselor he and his wife had been seeing for couples therapy. While he had been going to counseling, he’d never been put on medication. He found, however, that that was a necessary part of the solution for him.
Now Terhune runs a nonprofit organization, Team Guardian Inc.
“I feel like I’ve been given this opportunity to tell this story, because everybody who knows me is like, ‘What? There is no way that I would have ever thought that you would have gone down this road.’” Terhune said.  
“And so now I run a nonprofit, do a bunch of veteran stuff. But basically it’s about being there. I’m willing to get up in the middle of the night, and I’ve had people call me, you know, crying and saying, ‘You know, I need help.’ And I’m willing to get up in the middle of the night, go to your house, and sit and talk and get you through this.”
The Fire Watch
The National Library of Medicine notes that “suicide is a major public health challenge that disproportionately affects service members and veterans.” And for the past 12 years, suicide rates have been consistently higher among veterans than nonveterans.
Six hundred and twenty-two Florida military veterans killed themselves in 2023, the latest available data. That’s a dip from 655 veteran suicides in 2022 but an increase from the 612 Florida military veterans who killed themselves in 2021. 
But another effort to identify and help veterans at risk of suicide is showing signs of success in Florida.
Veteran suicide rates in the state dropped by 5% between 2019 and 2023, compared to just 1% nationally. But in a five-county area in Northeast Florida, the suicide rate dropped by 25% between 2019 and 2023, from 81 to 61, Florida Department of Health data show.
Nick Howland maintains that his organization, The Fire Watch, is helping to drive down the suicide rate in Duval, Clay, Baker, St. Johns, and Nassau counties through its “Watch Stander” program.
Since starting the program in Jacksonville in 2019, Howland and other founding members of The Fire Watch took a page from the American Heart Association, which in 1960 launched a closed-chest cardiac resuscitation course for physicians. It was the forerunner of CPR training for the general public.
Under the model, participants take a 45-minute course learning what is called “SAVE” training, teaching the “SIGNS” of crisis: ASK the veterans if they are considering suicide; VALIDATE the veterans’ experience; and EXPEDITE getting the veteran help. 
“Basically, what we do is train community members to recognize the warning signs of a veteran in crisis, to ask them if they need help, and to give them the help they need,” Howland said. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX“It’s inspired by CPR, because, you know, CPR basically isn’t training you to be a paramedic or a cardiologist. It’s training you to recognize when something’s different and to get help quick. And that’s what we’re doing.”
For Howland, the key to the program is broad community involvement, not just buy-in from the veterans community.
“There’s only 9% of the country who has served. So, if you’re relying on that 9% of the country to get veterans who are showing risk science to help, you’re leaving out a whole section, 91% of the people, who could be helping,” he told the Florida Phoenix. 
“What we do is train community members to recognize the warning signs of a veteran in crisis, to ask them if they need help, and to give them the help they need. “
Half of the 9,000 volunteer watch-standers, he said, reside in northeast Florida.
The program expanded to Hillsborough, Pinellas, Broward, Palm Beach, and Escambia Counties two years after its launch. The expansion locations have collectively experienced a 12% reduction in veteran suicides, according to Howland.
The other 57 counties lacking The Watch Stander program experienced a collective 2% reduction in veteran suicide rates, he said.
All of Howland’s statistics are based on Department of Health CHARTS (community health assessment resource tools data) and U.S. Census American Community Survey data. 
Meeting its goals
The Fire Watch has a vision statement: To end veteran suicide by preventing veteran suicide.
But that takes time.
The Fire Watch’s goals this year are to train 10,000 volunteers through its Watch Standers program, hoping that 70% of them interact with veterans quarterly and that 30% of the veterans with whom watch-standers interact will be referred for health care services.
It appears to be on track to meet those goals. 
The Centers for Disease Control Foundation developed a quarterly survey for The Fire Watch to track volunteer watch-standers’ efforts. The data show that since the second quarter of 2023, at least 76% of watch-finders have engaged with a veteran and that there’s never been under than a 31% referral rate (with a high 48% referral rate in 3Q 2024).
Howland’s third goal is to reduce suicide rates by 25% for three consecutive years in the 10-county area.
To date, that goal has proven more elusive.
Although there’s been a 25% reduction in veteran suicides between 2019 and 2023, the number per year has gone up and down. The number in Northeast Florida dropped to 38 in 2021 but jumped to 59 the following year, mostly due to an increase in Duval County.
The number of veteran suicides in Duval County nearly doubled between 2021 and 2022 jumping from 22 to 41, respectively.
As for Terhune, he said he has a list of people he contacts weekly.
“Whether they have medical issues or they’re struggling mentally or whatever else. I go down this list and I call them, and that could be that slap in the face, you know, someone sitting there with a pistol in their lap, getting ready to shoot themselves. And that could be that time that makes them rethink that, or stop, or realize that they do have more to give.”

Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerThis story by Liberty Darr was first published in the Other Paper on May 22.The City of South Burlington is pausing its effort to expand local voting rights to all legal residents.All resident voting would allow all the city’s legal residents, including those who are noncitizens, to vote in local elections and other supplementary school or city votes. The idea was first brought to the city council by the city’s Democratic committee last September with the hopes of having it placed on this year’s Town Meeting Day ballot. Since this would require a charter change, the city must bring the question to the voters for approval.While the committee at the time said it needed more time to study the issue, its final report recommended against moving forward at this time.Even the charter committee’s own members were split 4-3 on the decision. Committee members opposed to the expansion said, given the tense political climate, enabling people to put their names on a public list of legal non-citizens could make those people targets of federal retaliation, they said.They also said that, in this hostile environment, the committee would be unable to obtain useful information from the relevant South Burlington community to help them understand whether legal residents even want this change.“I immediately made the motion that we should put this thing in the freezer and wait, for humanitarian reasons,” Wendell Coleman, a member of the charter committee, told city council Monday.Anne LaLonde, another member of the committee, offered a different perspective.“This definitely, clearly comes from a place of empathy, and I understand that it’s a frightening time for noncitizens in the United States, whether you have a green card, whether you don’t, I think that’s a completely valid point of view,” she said. “But I would say I think legal residents of South Burlington should be able to choose for themselves whether or not to register to vote.”In the report, they listed an executive order by President Donald Trump that among other things, directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to “ensure that state and local officials have access to appropriate systems for verifying the citizenship or immigration status of individuals registering to vote or who are already registered” and to “take all lawful and appropriate action to make available information from relevant databases to state and local election officials engaged in verifying the citizenship of individuals registering to vote or who are already registered.”Committee members say it is unclear whether registered local non-citizen voters would be in Vermont’s database or in Vermont’s “publicly available voter registration list,” creating safety concerns for some residents.Other pending federal legislation would require proof of U.S. citizenship to register to vote in elections for federal office. And it remains murky what exactly that means for local elections, the committee wrote in its report.Three Vermont cities — Winooski, Montpelier and Burlington — have already allowed voting for all legal residents.All three cities have been challenged in court and upheld, but plaintiffs in the Burlington case have recently filed an appeal to the Vermont Supreme Court. That case is still ongoing.The committee undertook a series of public outreach initiatives, interviewing the clerks in each of the three cities and reaching out to several community groups to gauge feedback on how this topic would be received by legal permanent residents or new naturalized citizens.While council chair Tim Barritt had more of an appetite to continue the work now, other members of the council concurred with the committee’s recommendation. Aside from all councilors holding the moral standpoint that those who pay taxes should be able to vote on issues that pertain to the city, from a practical standpoint, the issue could prove difficult.“I think before we proceed, we need to have some confidence that the runway is not a very long runway, but a runway that actually is a genuine question that people should put thought to and make a decision,” councilor Mike Scanlan said.Before the vote to conclude the discussion, the committee had talked about continuing outreach to community groups and impacted community members and if the city council takes this issue up in the future, it could build off the plan to do community outreach to obtain more information and learn more about public opinion.“I’m full steam ahead,” Barritt said. “We’re operating out of fear for these individuals who might want to vote, and I understand that, but there almost is never a good time, so to speak, when you have situations like this, and we don’t know what’s going to unfold.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  South Burlington city hits pause on voting for all residents.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/south-burlington-1-20211110.jpg,,,2025-05-26 07:01:07.391694

Feb. 8 (Anna Spoerre/The Missouri Independent).The last time Missouri was in danger of losing an NFL franchise, deep disagreements between the governor and lawmakers over whether the state should pay for a new stadium led to litigation and the threat of a constitutional showdown.
It was 10 years ago when then-Gov. Jay Nixon and the legislature quarreled over a $1 billion plan to build a new St. Louis stadium for the Rams. 
Expecting GOP resistance, Nixon, a Democrat, came up with a strategy that didn’t involve the legislature. That sparked a group of legislators to file a lawsuit to block Nixon’s plan and threaten to refuse to allocate money the governor committed to the stadium when the General Assembly reconvened in January 2016. 
But that looming clash fizzled when the Rams announced an intention to move to Los Angeles two days before the 2016 session began. NFL owners overwhelmingly agreed to let them do it soon after.

A decade later, Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe is pushing a plan for the state to pay up to half the costs of a new stadium for the Kansas City Royals and renovations to Arrowhead Stadium for the Kansas City Chiefs. 
Both teams have expressed interest in leaving Missouri when the lease on their current stadiums expire in 2030, and Kansas lawmakers have put a deal on the table that would use state incentives to pay for up to 70% of the costs of new stadiums.
Kehoe has one advantage Nixon didn’t — a legislature dominated by his own party. But while the governor successfully convinced the Missouri House to sign off on a stadium funding plan earlier this month in the final days of the session, the Senate was in no mood to play ball. 
House Speaker Jon Patterson, a Lee’s Summit Republican, alerted his colleagues on Friday that the governor is expected to call the legislature back into session as early as next week to debate stadium funding. The governor may also include a $500 million construction package on the special session agenda, a move seen as vital to winning over support in the Senate for any stadium plan. 
But with partisan tensions running high after a tumultuous end to the regular legislative session, and serious heartburn among Republicans over the idea of spending hundreds of millions to subsidize sports franchises, the outcome is anything but certain. 
“I love the Kansas City Chiefs. I’m obnoxious during football season,” state Rep. Darin Chappell, a Republican from Rogersville, said in a recent interview with KSGF. “… But I’ve got constituents trying to pay their rent and feed themselves, and they’re struggling. And I’m going to take their money and give it to billionaires so multimillionaires can play in a prettier place? That’s obscene.”
Senate President Pro Tem Cindy O’Laughlin, a Shelbina Republican, said state funding for stadiums is “an easy demagogue topic.” But losing the teams to Kansas, she contends, would cost much more than the proposal put forth by the governor. 
“My personal belief is both the direct and indirect dollars accruing to Missouri businesses from the Chiefs and Royals being located here far exceeds what they are asking,” she wrote on social media. “I also believe if they left the state it would tear out the heart of Missouri, leaving two big concrete structures as a forever reminder of what might have been.”
Governor’s plan for Chiefs, Royals stadium funding derailed in the Missouri Senate

The Chiefs and the Royals face a deadline at the end of June on whether they will accept the offer from Kansas.
The proposal floated by Kehoe and set to be debated next week would pay up to half the cost — estimated to be up to $3 billion — as well as up to $50 million in tax credits for any direct investments made by the teams. 
The stadium plan died in the regular session when the Senate twice used a rare procedural rule to end debate on controversial bills on abortion and paid sick leave. The move infuriated Democrats, who vowed the Senate will not function normally until they feel they can trust the GOP to work towards compromise.
There is also lingering bipartisan anger over the projects that were lost when the House sunk a capital improvements bill. The $513 million would have paid for projects at eight hospitals around the state, supported a new nuclear reactor at the University of Missouri to make cancer treatments and a new mental health hospital in Kansas City.
The rollout of Kehoe’s plan didn’t help soothe the tensions.
Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle complained that the governor kept the legislature in the dark on stadium funding plans, then demanded it sign off on the proposal with little debate and no details on the cost.
The lack of legislative involvement echoes 2015, when lawmakers took umbrage at Nixon’s efforts to work around them by trying to use existing incentive programs to help fund a new St. Louis stadium.  Republicans and Democrats demanded Nixon either submit a proposal to the legislature or put it on the ballot for a vote. 
 “We will not stand idly by as the people of this state are committed to millions of dollars in debt without proper legislative approval or a public vote,” a group of House members said in a letter to Nixon at the time.
Lawmakers will get their wish this time around to have a say on whether Missouri taxpayers should help subsidize Kansas City stadiums. 
Kehoe is optimistic, arguing that keeping the teams in Missouri “is a critical piece of economic development. And I’d like to see us make sure we can solidify our offer with legislative approval.”

Vermont hospitals are charging more than five times the average sales price for outpatient drugs — the highest markup in the nation by a wide margin. Lawmakers are seeking to cap those prices.

Larry Labor, R-Morgan, sixth from left, at a huddle at the Speaker of the House’s podium during debate on a prescription pricing bill at the Statehouse in Montpelier on Friday, May 23. Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerLast year, Andy Kehler, a co-owner of Jasper Hill Farm, was looking to renew his employees’ health insurance plans.The first quote the Greensboro-based cheesemaker received — for an “apples to apples” renewal of the plans, Kehler said in an interview — would have cost 74% more than the 2024 plans. For a company with flat sales, now facing the threat of tariffs on its sales to Canada, the increase was nigh unaffordable, he said. “We ended up scrambling to get an only 44% increase,” Kehler said. “That’s just ridiculous. It’s completely unsustainable.”One big factor driving that price tag up: drugs. Jasper Hill is paying tens of thousands of dollars — a significant chunk of its roughly $300,000 annual health care costs — for pharmaceuticals to treat an employee’s autoimmune condition, Kehler said. The company is grappling with one of the state’s dubious distinctions. According to data from 2020 through 2022 compiled by RAND, a national policy think tank, Vermont has the nation’s highest prices for outpatient pharmaceuticals, by a wide margin. In Vermont, the average prices of outpatient pharmaceutical drugs — meaning, drugs administered to patients without admitting them to hospitals — are more than five times the manufacturers’ average sale prices, according to RAND. That’s the highest average markup out of all 50 states.Andy and Mateo Kehler, co-owners of Jasper Hill Farm. The cheesemaker has faced steep hikes in its insurance costs, driven in large part by outpatient drug prices. Photo courtesy of Andy KehlerOver the past several weeks, as lawmakers seek to rein in skyrocketing health care costs, that statistic has sparked criticism — and a legislative effort to cap those prices. “I can’t move beyond the immorality of this,” Rep. Alyssa Black, D-Essex, the chair of the Vermont House Committee on Health Care, told a hospital lobbyist Tuesday.“How is this not price-gouging?” she added. Low federal payoutsOutpatient pharmaceutical drugs are generally administered via injection or infusion in hospitals or clinics, rather than dispensed by a pharmacy. These are generally specialty drugs used to treat cancer, Crohn’s disease, autoimmune disorders or other conditions.“These tend to be drugs where you have a doctor and a nurse watching you while you’re taking the drug to make sure it’s working,” Sara Teachout, a lobbyist for Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont, said in an interview. Some hospitals are able to buy some of the drugs in question at a discount under a federal program called 340B. And yet, according to data Teachout presented to lawmakers last week, the markups for some of those drugs are steep. At the University of Vermont Medical Center, for example, one cancer treatment drug, Neulasta, costs private insurance nearly 70 times the manufacturer’s average sales price. Rep. Daisy Berbeco, D-Winooski, said on the House floor Friday that that markup means Vermonters who need that drug may pay $95,000 a year for Neulasta — compared with an average sales price of $1,357 a year. It’s not clear  — even to the state’s hospital association — why Vermont’s drug markups are so large. Vermont has the highest markups on outpatient drugs in the nation, according to RAND’s analysis of data from 2020 through 2022. Screenshot via RAND “I don’t know exactly why we’re so high,” Devon Green, a lobbyist for the Vermont Association of Hospitals and Health Systems, said in an interview. She said that she was not sure hospitals were even aware of the state’s disproportionate costs.But Green said she believes the reason has to do with low payments from the federal government’s Medicare and Medicaid programs. According to data compiled by a hospital consultant for Southwestern Vermont Medical Center, Vermont receives smaller Medicare payments than all other states for a variety of hospital procedures.“The hospitals in Vermont are the least paid (by Medicare) of any hospitals in any state in the union,” James Trimarchi, Southwestern Vermont’s planning director, said in an interview Thursday. The reason for that? “We don’t know,” Trimarchi said. Medicare calculates reimbursement rates based on numerous factors, including the procedure, type of facility and geographic region. “I hesitate to speculate,” he said. But, he noted, when Medicare reimbursements do not cover the cost of the procedures they help pay for, hospitals must make up the losses elsewhere — such as prices charged to private insurance for commercial drugs. ‘I do find it cruel’Some health care players, however, expressed doubt about that logic.“There are many reasons that Medicare reimbursements may be low, and I’m not sure that I necessarily agree with the premise,” Owen Foster, the chair of the Green Mountain Care Board, told lawmakers in the House health care committee Wednesday. He wondered whether Vermont’s hospital leaders are doing all they can to maximize their Medicare reimbursements — and why they weren’t dipping into cash reserves rather than hiking prices for drugs. “I do have to say that I do find it cruel to charge enormous markups on life-saving treatments to patients who are incredibly sick,” he said. On Thursday, Vermont’s House health care committee voted unanimously to advance an amendment that would cap those drug costs at 130% of their average sales price starting July 1, and 120% of their average sales price starting January 2026.The amendment, part of a larger bill relating to drug pricing, passed out of the House Friday and now heads to the Senate. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont has said that the proposal could reduce their requested premiums — which are expected to rise by double digit percentages — by four percentage points for individual and small group insurance plans on the health care marketplace, and three percentage points for school health insurance plans. The Vermont Association of Hospitals and Health Systems, however, said the proposed legislation would cause millions of dollars in losses, and would require multiple Vermont hospitals to cut staff or services. Asked in an interview later that day about the morality of charging large markups on critical pharmaceuticals, Green, the hospital lobbyist, paused for a long time. “I do not think that it is right,” she said finally. “And I think it is an unfortunate byproduct of a very flawed way of paying for health care.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  ‘How is this not price-gouging?’: Hospital drug markups spark legislation, anger .",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/prescription-pricing-1-20250523-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-05-26 07:01:07.391694

In Randolph and Rutland, bowling centers are keeping up the sport — and the camaraderie it inspires.

Photo by Catherine Morrissey/CNSEliza Walsh is a reporter with the Community News Service, a University of Vermont journalism internship.Rick Wilbur surveyed each lane at Rutland Bowlerama, marking up a scoresheet as pins crashed, high-fives smacked and kids scurried around decked-out competitors. It was a mid-April night of bowling in this year’s Green Mountain Open Tournament, and Wilbur, who’s been around the Rutland alley for over 50 years, was right at home. His family has been coming to Bowlerama for decades; he’s competed as a bowler for close to six. He started teaching his son Jon the craft of the game when the boy was 10 years old. Twenty-six years later, in 2019, Wilbur watched his son become the first Vermonter and 35th person in the U.S. to bowl a 900 series in open league play, achieving three consecutive perfect games in one set — all at Bowlerama on a Monday night. As Wilbur meandered his way among the lanes last month, regulars at the bowling alley patted his back and chatted with him while he kept score.“Being that I’ve been here so long, it’s like a family reunion every weekend,” he said. Rick Wilbur, Rutland Bowlerama employee, poses with his favorite bowling ball: a realistic eyeball.

Originally a 16-lane bowling house, the facility is now 32 lanes large, many of which still boast the original wood. Ron Carrara, lifelong Rutland resident, has worked maintenance at Bowlerama since he was a kid and grew up with Forte and his family — Forte’s mom being his Boy Scouts den mother. “It’s changed a lot,” Carrara said. “In the early ’70s this place was packed. Now, we’re lucky if we fill 10 or 12 lanes.” Bowling seems to be a dying pastime, with digital technology taking the forefront in family entertainment. According to industry firm Hansell Group, the U.S. had around 5,800 sanctioned bowling centers and nearly 120,000 lanes in 2003. By 2019, there were about 4,500 commercial centers with around 95,000 lanes in operation, the group reported.Increasingly, old bowling alleys nationwide have been converted into facilities offering a host of other games, activities and amenities. And new businesses opening up have focused on sleek, upscale experiences, according to the same report.But for the few rural bowling centers in Vermont, old school charm and long community ties have been tough to beat. Bowlerama still uses the analog keypads installed in the 1990s, and prior to that the center relied on halogen-lit, handwritten scorecards.Isaiah “Grizzly” Turgeon starts to count scores near the end of the competition on Easter Sunday at the Rutland Bowlerama. Photo by Catherine Morrissey/CNSWhile the regular crowd at Rutland Bowlerama isn’t what it used to be, the business had no trouble filling out its lanes for the Green Mountain Open Tournament, which participants traveled hours across New England to attend. “We have a lot of leagues, we have a lot of competition, we have a lot of fun,” Wilbur said. He is a coach for a local youth league and often helps out with Addison County Special Olympics events. The varsity bowling team at Fair Haven Union High School plays and practices at Bowlerama as well. The school has been in something of a friendly interstate rivalry with Randolph Union High School, and the two teams have duked it out at Bowlerama and elsewhere in recent years. Randolph is home to Valley Bowl, which holds a similar spirit to Bowlerama — the open game rate is $5 per hour with $3 shoe rentals and has been since the place opened in 2006. The year prior, the town’s only bowling center, Rose Bowl, closed after being sold to a New York developer who wanted to open a Family Dollar. Couple Karen and Wayne Warner, avid bowlers, had made a bid to buy the property but lost out.  A corkboard displays photos from years of bowlers past. Photo by Catherine Morrissey/CNSSo they bought all the bowling alley’s lanes and equipment off the old owner, built Valley Bowl on Prince Street and opened in January 2006. Karen Warner also runs the area’s Special Olympics program and has been coaching the Randolph Union bowling team for the past 10 years.Valley Bowl recently started up a kids-bowl-free promotion, which offers two free games a day to minors all the way through the summer. “What we try to do is grow a love of the sport,” said Warner. “We certainly see a lot of that come to fruition.”Warner drills balls at the Valley Bowl pro shop, one of the few in-house pro shops in that part of Vermont, and helps with many of the other needs of local bowlers. She’s familiar with the folks at Rutland Bowlerama and has crossed paths with them many times while coaching. “Fair Haven and us were in the finals this year,” Warner said. “They ended up coming out on top. They wanted it, and sometimes it’s about that want. They’re a fun group of kids.”Wilbur and Warner have also banded together to coach for the regional Senior Classic, a competition where the top 10 Vermont high school seniors go up against the top 10 seniors from New Hampshire. A competitor lets one rip during Rutland Bowlerama’s Easter Sunday competition. Photo by Catherine Morrissey/CNS“We all came together to coach these kids. It was a lot of fun,” Warner said. The two haunts preserve a sense of retro family fun in Vermont. Still, business continues to decline as bowling becomes a less fashionable form of recreation. “When one of these VT bowling houses closes, it’s not good for any of us,” said Warner. “It’s always good to see those guys, to talk to them as a resource. Maybe that doesn’t happen in other places, but it happens in this town.”Said Wilbur, “Seems like every three months, everything changes.” A retired police officer, Wilbur doesn’t let the slump get him down. He still bowls in a league every year from August to April, coming in recreationally with family and friends during the off season. It’s even a family tradition to bowl on Christmas Eve. “It’s just fun,” Wilbur said. “I think I was put here for this reason.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont bowling alleys preserving retro fun while facing biz trends.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Morrissey_Rutland_Bowlerama-13-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-26 07:01:07.391694

A federal judge last week ordered them reinstated, in the latest twist in the case. (Photo by Jess Daninhirsch/Capital News Service)A federal judge has temporarily blocked President Donald Trump’s executive order that would have dismantled the Department of Education, and he ordered the reinstatement of hundreds of department employees who were laid off in a massive March reduction in force.
U.S. District Judge Myong J. Joun ruled Thursday that there is no evidence the layoffs were part of a plan to improve efficiency at the department, but said they were merely steps toward closing the statutorily mandated agency without congressional approval, or even any effort to get Congress to do so.
“A department without enough employees to perform statutorily mandated functions is not a department at all,” Joun wrote. “This court cannot be asked to cover its eyes while the Department’s employees are continuously fired and units are transferred out until the Department becomes a shell of itself.”
The ruling, in the U.S. District Court for Massachusetts, came in response to legal challenges filed there by 21 Democratic attorneys general, including Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown, and by a coalition of labor and education groups . A separate challenge was filed days later by a group of advocacy and labor groups in U.S. District Court for Maryland.
Joun temporarily prohibited enforcement of a March 20 executive order that called for the department to take “all necessary steps to facilitate the closure” of the federal agency, as well as the president’s call to move oversight of federal student loans, nutrition programs and special education services to other federal agencies. Joun also ordered the return of more than 1,300 employees who were laid off in the March reduction in force.
Federal layoffs drag down state employment gains for second month, new numbers show

Madi Biedermann, a spokesperson for the department, told States Newsroom in a statement Thursday that the decision by “a far-left” judge overstepped his authority. The administration filed an appeal the same day.
“President Trump and the Senate-confirmed Secretary of Education clearly have the authority to make decisions about agency reorganization efforts, not an unelected Judge with a political axe to grind. This ruling is not in the best interest of American students or families,” Biedermann said.
But Brown, who has joined numerous lawsuits against the administration, said Joun’s injunction “ensures Maryland schools and students will get the resources they need while we continue the fight for our children’s future in court.”
“Employees who work for the Department of Education help keep class sizes small, make sure students with disabilities get the care and support they deserve, and administer college loans and grants to young adults so they can one day land their dream job,” Brown said in a statement released Friday morning.
Moody’s downgrades Prince George’s County bonds
Moody’s Analytics has downgraded its rating of Prince George’s County’s general obligation bonds from its highest rating of Aaa to Aa1, saying the county’s overall financial outlook is strong but noting that financial reserves are lower than other jurisdictions with similar ratings.
The rating Thursday came the same day that the other two major bond-rating agencies, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings, reaffirmed the highest AAA ratings for the county’s planned June 4 sale of $247.7 million in general obligation bonds. Both maintained their stable outlook for the county’s finances, with Standard & Poor’s saying it does “not expect to lower the rating during the next two years.”
Acting County Executive Tara Jackson acknowledged the “slight downgrade” by Moody’s but noted that it mirrors similar rating changes for other jurisdictions in the region. Both Maryland and the District of Columbia were downgraded in recent weeks by Moody’s from Aaa to Aa1.
Jackson said in a prepared statement that the overall ratings from all three agencies reaffirm the county’s position as “among the top-rated jurisdictions nationwide.”
“The AAA ratings from Fitch and S&P reaffirm our strong financial management and longstanding commitment to fiscal discipline,” Jackson’s statement said. “In light of our successful efforts to address the issues that led to their negative outlook, I am disappointed that Moody’s chose to downgrade us to Aa1.

“Our ability to meet those challenges demonstrates our agility and sound planning. By maintaining healthy reserves, diversifying revenue, and investing strategically in our communities, we continue to build investor confidence and deliver long-term stability for our residents,” she said.
The Moody’s report cited the county’s reliance on federal employment, with an estimated 9% of the county workforce classified as federal workers, but it said it “has seen minimal data suggesting negative consequences from either job contraction or policy shifts” at the federal level so far. It added that the county’s “very large and dynamic local economy, with a pipeline of ongoing redevelopment projects in progress” will offset the possible loss of projects like the proposed new FBI headquarters in Greenbelt, which President Donald Trump has proposed canceling.
But Moody’s said federal uncertainties present “risk to its [the county’s] budget and fiscal position in the next year and beyond,” and noted the county reserves, at 22% to 24% of revenues, were below the median of 33% for other Aa-rated jurisdictions. It reduced its ratings for county bonds across the board by a notch, but maintained a stable outlook for all.
Standard & Poor’s said its decision to keep an AAA rating for Prince George’s reflects “the county’s strong economic trends, robust management practices, and very strong budgetary flexibility and liquidity.” It also cited the county’s “ability to maintain generally stable finances, balancing competing expenditure priorities consistent with a large, diverse, and growing community.”
Fitch said its AAA rating represents “the county’s historically strong operating performance … and a ‘high midrange’ level of budgetary flexibility.”
AIB members needed
The independent body that oversees the state’s 10-yeear, multibillion-dollar education reform plan needs new members.
Applications opened Thursday for people to apply to the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future Accountability and Implementation Board (AIB). The AIB nominating committee will send the governor at least two names for each of three board vacancies.
Board member Mara Doss, a former associate vice president for teaching, learning and student success at Prince George’s Community College, plans to resign June 30 with one year left in her six-year term. Board member Laura Stapleton, who chairs the Human Development and Quantitative Methodology Department at the University of Maryland, College Park, said last week she will not reapply when her term expires July 1.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
AIB board member Joseph Manko, an education program officer at the Abell Foundation, also has a term that expires July 1. But Maryland Energy Secretary Paul Pinsky, who serves on the nominating committee, said in a meeting Tuesday that one person “is seeking reappointment,” without naming names.
Candidates should have expertise in certain areas, such as understanding of education policy, teaching in public schools and “leading and implementing systemic change in complex organizations,” and they must submit a 500-word essay describing how they would contribute to the success of the board.
Applications are due by 5 p.m. June 12 and nominees will be announced in July. The governor has 30 days after receiving the list to name the board members.
Homeland Security director to lose ‘acting’ title
Travis Nelson, the acting director of the Governor’s Office of Homeland Security since January 2024, is about to be “acting” no more: Gov. Wes Moore (D) announced Friday that Nelson will officially take over as director on June 11.
“For the last year and a half, Travis has already been doing the work – helming the Office of Homeland Security as acting director,” Moore said in a statement from his office. “This appointment marks simply the latest chapter in a distinguished record of keeping Marylanders safe and ensuring we are prepared for any crisis.”
Nelson, a 19-year veteran of the Maryland State Police, has “high-level experience coordinating complex public safety initiatives across the region,” according to the governor’s office. Since 2014, he has served as co-chair of the Maryland Active Assailant Interdisciplinary Work Group, working with multiple agencies to identify, prepare for and respond to active assailant incidents.
He was previously commander of the Maryland State Police Complex Operations Management Unit, responsible for contributing to the oversight, management, and planning of complex incidents and events, the governor’s office said. He began his public safety career more than 20 years ago in Kent and Queen Anne’s counties, serving as an emergency communications specialist, public safety dispatcher, emergency medical technician and state trooper. He is a life member of the Kent and Queen Anne’s Rescue Squad in Chestertown.
Nelson said he was honored to be named to the director’s job.
“In an era of evolving threats, our mission is clear: to build a more resilient, responsive, and unified security infrastructure that safeguards every Marylander,” he said, in the statement released by the governor’s office. “I look forward to working closely with our federal, state, and local partners to ensure the safety and security of all our communities.”
The Governor’s Office of Homeland Security was formed in 2003 by then-Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. to coordinate state homeland security efforts, advise the governor and assess Maryland’s readiness and ability to respond to disasters and emergencies.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/DOERally_20250328_JED6643.jpg,,,2025-05-26 11:05:46.244187

[…],"Jen Kruse, from Tipton, holds up a sign in protest of the Missouri State Legislature's decision to pass legislation to overturn voters' recent ballot measures. ""I wish reason would take over,"" she told The Independent. (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).Maybe you collected signatures last year so that Missourians could vote to overturn the state’s abortion ban. 
Maybe you walked door to door asking voters to support paid sick leave benefits for lower-wage workers.
Maybe you were one of millions of people who successfully voted to pass those measures on the statewide ballot last November.
Republicans in the Missouri legislature want you to go pound sand. They are not impressed with your hard work, or the sanctity of your vote, or your show of direct democracy. 
They have convictions to uphold, special interests to please and power to wield. And so, in a breathtaking show of arrogance, they wrapped up the 2025 legislative session by stomping all over the wishes of the state’s voters. 
First, Republicans passed a proposed constitutional amendment that, if approved by voters, would negate the freedoms won in Amendment 3, which enshrined the right to an abortion in the Missouri Constitution.
The just-passed Republican amendment seeks to deceive. Its language — which will likely be challenged in court — creates a narrow window in which victims of rape and incest and women with a medical emergency can obtain an abortion. It doesn’t mention that abortion will be banned for everyone else.
Following this betrayal of women, lawmakers moved on to workers.
They gutted a statute known as Proposition A, initiated by citizens, that passed with a hefty 58% of the vote. No citizens’ initiative is safe from the vicissitudes of Missouri’s Republican supermajority.
Lawmakers struck down a paid sick leave provision. They left intact a minimum wage increase but erased a provision that would have attached future increases to the rate of inflation. By the time the 2025 legislature mercifully adjourned, Prop A was a shadow of what its organizers had intended.
This is by no means the first time Missouri’s Republican supermajority has overturned the will of voters. Legislators have altered voter-initiated statutes in recent years having to do with puppy mills and redistricting and campaign finance. 
Constitutional amendments are somewhat less subject to damage, but Republicans nonetheless tried to thwart an amendment calling for expansion of Medicaid eligibility by refusing to grant the funding until ordered to do so by a court.
During that fracas, in 2021, a then-Republican legislator said the quiet part out loud. 
“I am proud to stand against the will of the people,” Justin Hill, a representative from the St. Louis area, declared from the House floor.
There you have it.
Most Republicans prefer to frame their disregard for voters a bit more diplomatically.
“Those who support conservative measures and vote us into office expect us to stand our ground on issues which reflect their bedrock beliefs,” Senate President Pro Tem Cindy O’Laughlin said on social media after Republicans gutted the two voter initiatives this month. 
This willingness of voters to support progressive measures while simultaneously electing rock-solid conservative legislators is indeed the great disconnect in Missouri politics.
But almost six of 10 voters supported paid sick leave for low-wage workers. That seems quite bedrock. The people expecting lawmakers to “stand their ground” on this particular issue are select business interests which are powerful in Jefferson City.
“I am proud of all my colleagues for taking a stand for what we consider right,” O’Laughlin added in her social media post. 
Which is just a short hop, skip and jump away from “I am proud to stand against the will of the people.” 
Republican lawmakers count on voters across the state to not watch what they do too closely, and to forget about their outrages once the session adjourns.
But if anything grabs the attention of Missourians, it could be this latest double punch. 
Prompted by groups such as Missouri Jobs for Justice and the recently formed Respect Missouri Voters, protesters convened at the Capitol and in locations around the state.
On the protest lines, they mingled with people out and about objecting to Trump administration policies. That’s a willing audience, already in the streets, just waiting to be informed about what the state legislators are up to.
And for those who missed the rallies, volunteers are distributing flyers at the homes of voters in legislative districts where Proposition A garnered more support in November than the Republican lawmakers representing the district. 
That includes House Speaker Jon Patterson’s district in Lee’s Summit.
Patterson didn’t vote for the House measure seeking to reinstate an abortion ban, but he didn’t do much to slow it down, either. And his explanation that he supports paid sick leave but voted to gut Prop A because he doesn’t think state government should mandate the benefit is double talk.
Across Missouri, workers who are finally accruing sick time are being told that the benefit will be taken away from them. And people who only a few months ago celebrated the end of an abortion ban are finding out that they’ll have to go back to work to preserve a right they legitimately won.
A simple question keeps coming up: How can they do this to us?
They do it because they can.
Until enough voters decide they can’t.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/051525_workersrally7-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-05-26 07:01:07.391694

Wes Moore said it needed more study, writes J.H. Snider. But a year later, there's been no study, the issue has come and gone and this year's version of the bill failed.","A worker poses by the presses of the Daily Republic in Fairfield, California, in this 2018 file photo. (Photo by Staff Sgt. Amber Carter/U.S. Air Force)Maryland law mandates that estate beneficiaries pay hundreds of dollars, plus transaction costs, to place legal ads in a local newspaper announcing an estate’s opening.
In 2024 and 2025, Maryland’s legislature introduced bills to revoke that mandate and instead allow such notices to be posted for free on a more publicly accessible government website.
Experts knowledgeable about estate legal ads know that virtually no potential beneficiaries and creditors learn about a deceased person via such ads. But the mandate is politically impregnable because it benefits one of Maryland’s most politically powerful industries at the expense of the politically weak; that is, monopoly local newspapers receive millions of dollars per year while the average Marylander only pays hundreds of dollars per lifetime.
This incentive structure of concentrated industry benefits and diffuse public costs constitutes the classic incentive structure of special interest politics. The problem is compounded by the local newspaper lobby’s unique power, as reflected in the politicians’ motto: “Never pick a fight with anyone who buys ink by the barrel.”

Today, Maryland mandates some 190 separate statutory legal ad subsidies for the local newspaper industry, of which the estate subsidy is only one.  But the industry worries that revoking even one of these subsidies will cause a domino effect, so fights accordingly.
The case against the obsolete estate legal ad mandate was so compelling that the 2024 legislation revoking it passed both the Maryland House and Senate unanimously (175-0). (Assisting such support, when the bill was introduced, Maryland’s leading newspaper chain was owned by an unpopular, out-of-state hedge fund.)
But Gov. Wes Moore then vetoed the legislation, justifying his veto on the basis that the issue needed more study:
“This veto should not be seen as the end of the conversation, and in fact the administration believes we need a broader conversation about public notices rather than a conversation focused solely on estate notices. Our administration looks forward to engaging with … all of the advocates on that topic during the interim,” he wrote.
This year the same bill was introduced in the legislature and again passed unanimously (132-0) in the House. But it wasn’t allowed even a vote in the Senate’s Judiciary Committee, whose chair, as is said in Annapolis, “placed the bill in his desk.” The chair didn’t respond to my written query asking him to explain his opposition.
I first got a sense of how dirty newspaper legal ad politics was when decades ago I tried to gather data to study them. I had worked at a D.C. think tank studying media public policy and knew that legal ads were the newspaper industry’s largest government subsidy.
No scholarly data existed on this subject because other scholars who had tried to study such subsidies had run up against the same brick wall I had; that is, I could find no industry data because national and state newspaper organizations, while aggressively lobbying for such subsidies, had refused to provide authoritative data on them, and politicians were too terrified of the industry’s political power to ask how much their subsidies cost the public. So most Maryland legislative sessions some legislation passes that expands legal ad newspaper subsidies without accountability provisions.
I was curious: Did the governor fulfill his veto statement’s promises? The answer is no. In the year between the end of the 2024 and 2025 legislative sessions, neither the Governor nor his staff participated in, let alone orchestrated, such a public discussion.
My sense is that the best hope to eliminate Maryland’s obsolete estate legal ad laws would be to shame the governor into acting consistent with his own stated values, as he has promised to support the poor and politically weak, and that’s whom estate legal ads most hurt. On the other hand, since the media have negligible incentive to expose this hypocrisy, such hope appears quixotic. Moreover, the governor’s politically astute aides have undoubtedly counseled him not to risk the newspaper industry’s wrath, given its power to shape his and his opponents’ public image.
Conversely, recall that the governor won a Bronze Star for bravery. Accordingly, the governor should convene his promised public forum to discuss the merits of newspaper legal ads. Until then, he should instruct his staff to stop lobbying to kill legislation that only reduces but not expands legal ad subsidies. (The largest new newspaper subsidy last session reduced newspapers’ legal ad costs).
If the governor’s policy is only to call for public discussion when reducing but not increasing newspaper industry subsidies, that double standard should be called out.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/4993621-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-05-26 07:01:07.391694

When the Navy first called to tell his daughter, Virginia Harbison, that her father’s remains had been identified, she hung up. At 91, living in assisted care in Texas, she could hardly believe it. It was her son, Bill Ingram, who called her back to share the news again. She was silent for so long that he had to ask if she was all right. “Bill,” she said, “I hadn’t thought about that for 60 years.”
She has lived the full life her father never had the chance to. In March, Ingram pushed his mother in her wheelchair to her father’s gravesite for the burial.
“They fold the flag in this very tight, nice triangle, and then with white gloves, the commanding officer comes and takes it and kneels down and hands it to my mother,” said Ingram, who lives in San Francisco. “It was incredible.”
On Dec. 7, 1941 during the attack on Pearl Harbor, 429 service members aboard the USS Oklahoma died. Horrifyingly, men trapped below deck after the ship capsized could be heard tapping out “SOS” in Morse code as the air supply dwindled. Though 32 men were rescued, the rest were tragically not reached in time.
After the war ended, the remains were recovered and buried in the National Cemetery of the Pacific in Hawaii, too water damaged and commingled to be identified individually. There they remained for years until modern science caught up with historical tragedy.
The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency disinterred the USS Oklahoma remains in 2015 to send to a DNA laboratory. Carrie LeGarde, a forensic archaeologist with the agency and project lead for the Oklahoma Project, said her team started the process by testing small pieces of bone for maternal line DNA. Overall, they inventoried 13,000 bones and took 4,900 DNA samples. For Connolly, identification was complicated.
“We had several sequences that had multiple individuals, and that was actually the case with John Connolly, and part of why his identification occurred later in the project,” she said.

Since John Connolly was older than most of the men aboard the USS Oklahoma as one of the few officers on the ship and scheduled to retire just three weeks after the bombing, the team at DPAA relied on dental evidence in addition to DNA testing to confirm his identity.
Connolly was born in Savannah in 1893 and joined the Navy in 1912. He served during World War I and was eventually promoted to a chief warrant officer. In 1941, his wife, Mary Connolly, and their two daughters, eight-year-old Virginia and six-year-old Helen were eagerly awaiting his return and retirement in Long Beach, California, when the Navy informed them he had died.
Mary Connolly never remarried.
“She was very sad all her life because she married at age 30 or 31 and her husband was away in the service, but was killed right before he was supposed to retire,” Ingram said.
Connolly’s memory has been passed down through the generations.
“We’ve taken my family to Hawaii, and we went to the memorial and found the marker for his name,” Ingram said.
Everything changed last year when Ingram got a call from the Navy. In a 200-page report, the Navy detailed the historical background, identification process and scientific evidence.

“With the research that was involved, both with historical research and medical research, there’s a lot of folks at DPAA that are involved,” Navy POW/MIA branch head Richard Jenkins said. “We as a service will explain that to the family, with the hopes of them feeling comfortable with the findings and showing them that it’s not just any set of remains, it’s actually going to be that person.”
There’s a story that runs in Ingram’s family about his grandfather. A couple of years after World War II, a young man knocked on the family home and introduced himself to Virginia and Mary Connolly. He had been on the USS Oklahoma with John Connolly, he said, and when the ship was hit, Connolly pushed open a hatch and forced him out. Connolly had saved his life.
In 1944, the Navy re-commissioned one of their ships as the USS John Connolly. Though his story was a tragic one – an officer who never returned home whose remains were left unknown – history has granted him a second chance at closure. Over eight decades later, he got the hero’s burial he deserved.
“They did everything. They had a band. They played Taps. They fired the guns,” Ingram said. “Seven soldiers fired three times for a 21-gun salute.”
A final sendoff at last.

(Photo by Pat Kinney with background via Canva)MARSHALLTOWN — Ralph Alshouse hadn’t even seen an airplane until he was in his teens.
That was about 90 years ago. He’d see a lot of planes — from the inside —throughout World War II.
Now 101, he can recall a few times he may not have lived to 21 by the time the war ended in 1945.
But he knew from his dad, who saw trench warfare in World War I, that if he went to war, an airplane was where he wanted to be.
Alshouse, a resident of the Iowa Veterans Home in Marshalltown, was a Navy pilot who delivered or “ferried” planes all over the country from the manufacturer to be loaded on to aircraft carriers, or brought battle-worn craft into repair shops. He was part of Ferry Squadron VRF-2, based in Columbus, Ohio, but flew to installations nationwide.
Growing up near Oelwein and graduating from high school in Stanley in 1941, he went into the Navy shortly after Pearl Harbor.
The duty was hazardous enough, flying various aircraft which had equally varying and challenging capabilities. He had 13 emergency landings during the war, out of 146 flights and more than 1600 hours flight time, involving 28 different kinds of naval aircraft, ranging from small Piper Cub medical evacuation ambulance planes, to Marine Corsair and Navy Helldiver fighter-bombers to multi-engine heavy bombers like the B-24 Liberator or its Navy version, the PB4Y-2 Privateer.
On one nighttime training flight, he dodged an encounter with a tropical storm over the Gulf of Mexico. Two other cadets weren’t as fortunate.
“We were flying out of Pensacola Naval Air Base (in Florida), flying (Vought) OS2Us (Kingfisher observation float planes). Each of us had one. It was the final phase of our training before we got our wings. And three of us went out, and I was the only one to make it back. We were in the Gulf. We hit a line cloud out there they didn’t know about. And I told the other two guys, ‘I’m gonna turn (away from the storm); so let’s all turn.’ They said, “No, no our orders are to go straight.’ ”
He radioed out and received clearance to turn; the other cadets didn’t pick up the message over the static. He radioed back to them after making the turn but received no answer.

“I thought ‘Well, I better head back to base.’ There was no light, darker than hell, and my first thought was, ‘Oh s–t, I must be lost.’ And then all at once I saw the flicker of the (airfield) beacons. When you’re think you’re lost out at sea, in the middle of the night, and you see a beacon, boy, that makes you feel better.
“We went out the next morning with everything that flew; I think there was eight to us,” looking for the missing pilots, Alshouse said. “And we didn’t find a thing.”
On another occasion, he was pulling a target behind him for gunnery practice for other planes — only to get shot at himself. He discovered dents in his own craft after landing. Had the pilots been using a higher caliber ammunition in practice, the outcome might had been far different.
While ferrying a small medical evacuation plane from Florida to a shop near Memphis, Tenn., for repairs — basically a flying ambulance with space for one patient in the rear of the cockpit — he touched down at the scene of a serious multiple-injury automobile accident and picked up the victim in the worst condition for transport for medical treatment. He taxied off the pavement as highway patrol officers at the scene cleared the road for him to take off.
Among other narrow escapes, he also made a forced landing in Pittsburgh of a Corsair fighter plane on fire. In another instance, he and comrades rescued another pilot from a downed, burning plane before it exploded.
Alshouse, a 1948 graduate of Iowa State University in dairy science, is retired from work as a farmer, Farmers Home Administration farm appraiser at different locations around the state. He also served a stint as the mayor of Seymour in Wayne County near Centerville southeast of Des Moines.
He’s a former chairman of the Rathbun Area Solid Waste Commission. In 2018, he was recognized by a recycling customer, Indian Hills Community College in Ottumwa, for helping provide commission land to the college to start a sustainable agriculture program.

He found another more recent calling — as an author. He jotted down memories of his service to his offspring. A fellow former military pilot he met at a veteran dinner in Seymour, retired U.S. Marine Corps Capt. Mark Hewitt, suggested he write a book. He had no intention of such thing, but discovered he in fact already had enough material for one, if he combined all his written recollections.
He fused all those reminiscences into a book, entitled “80 Percent Luck, 20 Percent Skill.” It was published in 2023 and is available online on Amazon and through Barnes & Noble.
Alshouse saw his first plane as he was working for his dad in the farm field near Oelwein.
“I was cultivating beans one day. It landed in the hay field south of where I was cultivating beans,” he said. “Two gentlemen in business suits got out,” a car picked them up, “and they left the airplane.” They may have been going to a nearby farm on business on a property that had been through foreclosure.
His father came over from an adjacent field. Ralph came up on the plane, a Club Cadet, and peeked inside. “My God, all those instruments and all those controls.” he said. “I told Dad it must take a genius to fly one of those.
“That gave me the urge,” he said, “after Dad told me about all the guys that was killed in no man’s land in World War I. There was so much gunfire the trees fell over and they stacked the bodies up like cordwood and get behind them (for cover) to shoot. That helped me commit to being in the air instead of on the ground.”
He saw advertisements in the local paper seeking applicants for flight training. Lacking applicants, the standards were lowered from a four-year college degree, to a two-year degree, to high schools. “That’s when I stepped in,” he said. He and other enlistees didn’t know the different between the advantages of different branches of service, “we just wanted to fly.”
He took testing and training in Decorah, Minneapolis and pre-flight training at the University of Iowa in Iowa City, where he became a champion boxer in his class. “I never had a pair of boxing gloves on before, but I won the championship,” though he quipped, “My nose always got in the way.” He was bloodied a few times.
“We had about a 25 percent washout rate at Iowa City,” he said. He received flight training at the naval air installation at Wold Chamberlain Airport in Minneapolis, and then to Pensacola for training in catapult-launched scout planes like the kind used on various naval ships at that time.
“I got shot off a catapult three times in flight training,” he said “If you think you know what happiness is, that’s when you’re happy, that you’re still alive” and flying after a catapult launch.
Ralph still flew some in civilian life after the war. He had an ultralight craft and still has a trophy from a glider competition he won in 1970.
And his flying skills allowed him to avoid another close call — as a farm appraiser.
When a shotgun-wielding farmer ordered Alshouse off the property, he complied — but still flew over the farm and conducted the appraisal by air.
He discovered that on many occasions in peacetime as well as war, it’s still safer by air than on the ground.

When the Navy first called to tell his daughter, Virginia Harbison, that her father’s remains had been identified, she hung up. At 91, living in assisted care in Texas, she could hardly believe it. It was her son, Bill Ingram, who called her back to share the news again. She was silent for so long that he had to ask if she was all right. 
“Bill,” she said, “I hadn’t thought about that for 60 years.”
She has lived the full life her father never had the chance to. In March, Ingram pushed his mother in her wheelchair to her father’s gravesite for the burial. 
“They fold the flag in this very tight, nice triangle, and then with white gloves, the commanding officer comes and takes it and kneels down and hands it to my mother,” said Ingram, who lives in San Francisco. “It was incredible.”

On Dec. 7, 1941, during the attack on Pearl Harbor, 429 service members aboard the USS Oklahoma died. Horrifyingly, men trapped below deck after the ship capsized could be heard tapping out “SOS” in Morse code as the air supply dwindled. Though 32 men were rescued, the rest were tragically not reached in time.

(Courtesy of John Grinvalds)LINCOLN — After his fifth goodwill and fact-finding trip to war-torn Ukraine, a former Nebraska state legislator and decorated veteran still feels that Ukraine can prevail in its war with Russia if given the right weapons.
And former State Sen. Tom Brewer, who represented north-central Nebraska, said he sees a possible reckoning ahead for President Donald Trump in his dealings with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Putin, he said, has never been truthful in his negotiations over the war, and his latest flirtations with peace talks may turn out to just be a delaying tactic to allow Russian forces to get organized for a summer offensive.
“There’s a huge game of chess that’s being played right now,” Brewer said in a recent interview. “I think the next month will bring to light that Putin is not serious about negotiations, he’s just buying time.”
“If you look at history, the Russians have never been honest about any of the negotiating they’ve done,” he added. “Why would they start now?”
Brewer, now 66, is at an age when most veterans are working on their golf game or heading out on a fishing trip. He’s had more than 70 surgeries to repair war wounds and a bad back. The trip by plane, train, bus and eventually Toyota 4Runners in the dark of night is long and grueling, over roads pock-marked by missile strikes.
But he keeps going back to Ukraine in part because he admires their freedom-loving spirit and in part because he feels his military experience — six tours of duty in Afghanistan and experience with artillery and helicopters — could help their war effort.
Reconstruction will require help
Eventually, he believes he could also help the reconstruction of a country known as the “bread basket of Europe.”
On this latest trip he was accompanied by Don Hutchens, a retired head of the Nebraska Corn Board and a veteran of foreign trade missions. They set up a video meeting with University of Nebraska President Jeffrey Gold and Ukraine’s ministers of agriculture and intelligence to lay the groundwork for possible collaboration in rebuilding Ukraine’s crop production.

Ukraine has lost more than 20% of its farmland since the Russians invaded, according to Alliance Magazine, and an estimated 139,000 square kilometers of land — almost twice the size of Nebraska — are suspected to hold land mines.
Brewer said that in areas where the Russians had occupied, anything of value was taken and farm machinery not taken was disabled. Farmers are left using old equipment in hopes of growing a crop, he said.
During his trip, Brewer visited associates of Howard Buffett, the son of Omaha billionaire Warren Buffett, who is on track to pass a total of $1 billion in private aid this year given to Ukraine to remove mines and provide new combines, planters and tractors.
“(Buffett) has a really good team over there that is well-organized,” he said. “He’s probably more highly thought of than anyone else in the country. If he wanted to run for president he could beat out (Ukraine President Volodymyr) Zelinskyy.”
Brewer also visited an orphanage under construction near Kyiv that has been supported by Ukrainian-Americans as well as a hospital where wounded soldiers are fitted for prosthetic limbs. An estimated 52,000 Ukrainians have lost parts of arms and legs in the war, he said, which has left possibly 18,000 children orphaned.
Some aid still coming
Some U.S. military aid is still reaching troops in Ukraine, he said, but the elimination of the USAID agency has meant an end of food shipments to those living in a “no-man’s land” near the front. Despite the pull back of some American aid, the Ukrainians provided a warm welcome back, Brewer said.
As after past trips, the former legislator will provide a trip report to the Nebraska delegation in Congress in hopes that makes a difference.

On this trip, Brewer watched young Ukrainian soldiers, fueled by Red Bull and vape pens, guiding attack drones and was impressed by the capability of an artillery team unit that got only three week’s training on guns the U.S. Army provides months of training to operate.
He said that if he was “king for a day,” the U.S. would provide more long-range missiles so that Russian forces could be moved farther away from the Ukrainian border to deter drone attacks and dropping of unguided “glide bombs.” Tougher sanctions, Brewer added, could help squeeze the Russian economy to the point that they would give up.
The former senator said he is sometimes “astounded” about how long it took the U.S. to provide the weaponry that is needed.
The sounds of drones buzzing overhead is a constant near the front, Brewer said, and the glide bombs, which cannot be detected by anti-missile batteries, have exacted a horrible toll.
He said that this war could completely reshape Europe and the future of democracy, and it’s important to stop Putin now, or else he will be emboldened to invade more countries. Brewer said he “hates” the idea that Ukraine would have to give up valuable territory to end the war.
“The only way to defeat (the Russians) is to defeat them on the battlefield,” he said, “and the only way to do that is give (Ukraine) the right weapons to do it.”
“Even though they’ve been through three years of war, and even though they’ve lost an estimated 100,000 civilian and military lives, their spirit is still passionate about staying free,” Brewer said.
“You’re not going to see the Ukrainian people say, ‘We’ve had enough.’ I think they’ll fight until they have nothing left to fight with.”

Overall, they inventoried 13,000 bones and took 4,900 DNA samples. For Connolly, identification was complicated. 
“We had several sequences that had multiple individuals, and that was actually the case with John Connolly, and part of why his identification occurred later in the project,” she said.
Since John Connolly was older than most of the men aboard the USS Oklahoma as one of the few officers on the ship and scheduled to retire just three weeks after the bombing, the team at DPAA relied on dental evidence in addition to DNA testing to confirm his identity. 
Connolly was born in Savannah, Georgia, in 1893 and joined the Navy in 1912. He served during World War I and was eventually promoted to a chief warrant officer. In 1941, his wife, Mary Connolly, and their two daughters, 8-year-old Virginia and 6-year-old Helen, were eagerly awaiting his return and retirement in Long Beach, California, when the Navy informed them he had died. 
Mary Connolly never remarried. 
“She was very sad all her life because she married at age 30 or 31 and her husband was away in the service, but was killed right before he was supposed to retire,” Ingram said.

Connolly’s memory has been passed down through the generations.
“We’ve taken my family to Hawaii, and we went to the memorial and found the marker for his name,” Ingram said. 
Everything changed last year when Ingram got a call from the Navy. In a 200-page report, the Navy detailed the historical background, identification process and scientific evidence.
“With the research that was involved, both with historical research and medical research, there’s a lot of folks at DPAA that are involved,” Navy POW/MIA branch head Richard Jenkins said. “We as a service will explain that to the family, with the hopes of them feeling comfortable with the findings and showing them that it’s not just any set of remains, it’s actually going to be that person.”
There’s a story that runs in Ingram’s family about his grandfather. A couple of years after World War II, a young man knocked on the family home and introduced himself to Virginia and Mary Connolly. He had been on the USS Oklahoma with John Connolly, he said, and when the ship was hit, Connolly pushed open a hatch and forced him out. Connolly had saved his life. 
In 1944, the Navy re-commissioned one of their ships as the USS John Connolly. Though his story was a tragic one – an officer who never returned home whose remains were left unknown – history has granted him a second chance at closure. Over eight decades later, he got the hero’s burial he deserved. 
“They did everything. They had a band. They played ‘Taps.’ They fired the guns,” Ingram said. “Seven soldiers fired three times for a 21-gun salute.” 
A final sendoff at last.

Forecasters at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration expect above-average hurricane activity this season.
The federal agency, in its annual outlook released Thursday, predicted 13 to 19 named storms, including six to 10 hurricanes. Of those, it expects three to five major hurricanes of category 3, 4 or 5 strength, packing winds of 111 mph or greater.
The agency said there was a 60% chance of an above-normal season, a 30% chance of a near-normal season and a 10% chance of a below-normal season. The forecast represents an estimate of activity, not number of landfalls.
The average season features 14 named storms, including seven hurricanes and three major hurricanes, according to NOAA. The season begins Sunday, June 1, and ends Nov. 30.
“We’re ready here at NOAA,” said Ken Graham, director of the National Weather Service, during a news briefing held in Gretna, to mark 20 years since Hurricane Katrina. “Are you?”
NOAA based its forecast on a confluence of factors, including warmer than average ocean temperatures, potentially weak wind shear and the possibility of higher activity from the West African Monsoon, a primary starting point for Atlantic hurricanes. Warmer oceans fuel storms with more energy, while weaker winds allow them to develop without disruption.
Forecasters at Colorado State University also anticipate an above-average season, with 17 named storms — including nine hurricanes, four of them major. The forecasters predicted activity would be about 125% of that during an average season between 1991 and 2020.
By comparison, activity in 2024 was about 130% of an average season’s during that time. The 2024 season will be best-remembered for hurricanes Helene and Milton, which together caused more than 250 fatalities and $120 billion in damage across the Southeast.
The Colorado State University forecasters said this season there is a 51% chance of a major hurricane striking the U.S., with a 26% chance of one of the storms making landfall along the East Coast and 33% chance along the Gulf Coast. They predict a 56% chance of a major hurricane tracking through the Caribbean.
The season arrives amid widespread uncertainty over the role the federal government will play in disaster response and recovery, as the Trump administration fires employees, freezes funding and dismantles agencies. NOAA and the Federal Emergency Management Agency are among the targets.
“Uncertainty is not great,” said Phil Klotzbach, a senior research scientist at Colorado State University’s Department of Atmospheric Science. “It just adds another layer of stress. That isn’t great when people are trying to prepare for hurricane season.”
As much as 30 percent of the workforce at NOAA’s National Weather Service has been eliminated, said Rick Spinrad, a former NOAA administrator under the Biden administration. He worried NOAA may struggle to maintain its Hurricane Hunter flights, which he said account for a 15 percent improvement in track and intensity forecasting.
“If you lose that capacity to predict the track, you could either unnecessarily evacuate tens or hundreds of thousands of people, or evacuate the wrong people or not evacuate people who should be evacuated,” he said. “So we are putting lives and property in significant danger with the degradation of the forecast capability.”
No changes to the flights have been proposed, said Michael “Mac” McAlister, who has flown with the Hurricane Hunters for 10 years. This will be the 50th season for one of the two aircraft involved in the program, a WP-3D Orion named Kermit. The other plane is called Miss Piggy.
“There are hardly any 50-year-old pieces of this aircraft left,” McAlister said, referring to Kermit. “The wings get chopped off every five years. In my opinion these are two of the greatest national assets because of the data they provide.”
No one from the National Hurricane Center, a division of the National Weather Service, attended this year’s National Hurricane Conference in New Orleans, said Craig Fugate, a former FEMA administrator under the Obama administration and former director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management.
Normally the National Hurricane Center would brief state and local emergency managers at the conference on new forecasting methods, to help the managers improve communications with the public about, say, when evacuations are necessary. The training is important because there can be high turnover among emergency managers, he said.
“I’m just not aware of any other time that the hurricane center staff wasn’t at that conference,” Fugate said.
NOAA declined to comment on the conference but said Thursday its forecasts would be no less accurate. For instance, the federal agency said the model used to predict hurricanes would undergo an upgrade that would improve track and intensity forecasts by as much as 5 percent.
“We are fully staffed at the Hurricane Center, and we are definitely ready to go,” said Laura Grimm, acting NOAA administrator. “We are really making this a top priority for the administration.”
Kim Doster, the agency’s communications director, added in a statement, “in the near term, NWS has updated the service level standards for its weather forecast offices to manage impacts due to shifting personnel resources. These revised standards reflect the transformation and prioritization of mission-essential operations, while supporting the balance of the operational workload for its workforce. NWS continues to ensure a continuity of service for mission-critical functions.”
Meanwhile, FEMA is in turmoil, with President Donald Trump suggesting he might eliminate the federal agency. Cameron Hamilton, acting head of FEMA, was ousted earlier this month after testifying before a congressional subcommittee that elimination would not be “in the best interest of the American people.” His dismissal coincided with National Hurricane Preparedness Week, declared by Trump in a proclamation in which the president said he remained “steadfastly committed to supporting hurricane recovery efforts and ensuring that Federal resources and tax dollars are allocated to American citizens in need.”
But during Trump’s first week in office he appointed a task force to review FEMA’s ability to respond to disasters. And in March he signed an executive order asserting that federal policy must “recognize that preparedness is most effectively owned and managed at the State, local, and even individual levels.” The order called on state and local governments and individuals to “play a more active and significant role in national resilience and preparedness.”
In April the administration denied a request for assistance from Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, a Republican, after tornadoes ripped through several counties there. The administration approved the request in May.
Nonetheless, FEMA told Inside Climate News in a statement, before Hamilton was fired, that its response to disasters would not be diminished.
“Unlike the previous administration’s unprepared, disgraceful and inadequate response to natural disasters like Hurricane Helene, the Trump administration is committed to ensuring Americans affected by emergencies will get the help they need in a quick and efficient manner,” the statement reads. “All operational and readiness requirements will continue to be managed without interruption in close coordination with local and state officials ahead of the 2025 Hurricane Season. Emergency management is best when led by local and state authorities.”
In Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis welcomed the prospect of more state leadership in disaster response. During an April event in Kissimmee he said he believed the Trump administration would send block-grant funding to states, which could manage the calamities more efficiently.
“We’re not going to be left in the cold. But I can tell you that the FEMA bureaucracy is an impediment to disaster recovery,” said DeSantis, who ran against Trump in the 2024 Republican primary. “We’re nimble. We’re quick. We adjust. So empower the states. Give us the resources, and we don’t necessarily need the federal government to be involved at all.”
But state and local governments already lead the response to disasters, Fugate notes. Governors request federal help only when the scope of the crisis exceeds the state’s capabilities, with the federal government providing little more than funding.
He said it was too soon to guess how all of the developments may affect hurricane season.
Even more cuts could be coming
Trump’s budget request, released earlier this month, would slash more than $1.3 billion from NOAA and $646 million from FEMA. Congress must approve the proposal.
An earlier leaked draft, obtained by Inside Climate News, would abolish NOAA’s research office, called Oceanic and Atmospheric Research or NOAA Research. The office is charged with providing unbiased science to, among other things, improve forecasts and enhance warnings ahead of disasters. The draft included $171 million for the office, down from $485 million in 2024. The few programs that remain, including research into severe storms, would be moved primarily to the National Weather Service and National Ocean Service.
The Trump administration’s 2026 budget passback, as the draft was called, included “significant reductions to education, grants, research, and climate-related programs within NOAA,” according to the document. “Passback levels support a leaner NOAA that focuses on core operational needs, eliminates unnecessary layers of bureaucracy, terminates nonessential grant programs and ends activities that do not warrant a Federal role.”
Project 2025, the conservative strategy for remaking the federal government, calls for NOAA to be taken apart, with many functions eliminated, privatized or moved to other agencies or state and local governments. The document suggests reforming FEMA to shift much of its spending on preparedness and response to state and local governments.
“We’re just providing as accurate information as we can,” said Andy Hazelton, a National Weather Service scientist who was let go earlier this year. “Hopefully we can get back to that, but it’s been a very, very tough environment for the last few months.”
In central Florida, all of the uncertainty has left Alan Harris, the emergency manager in Seminole County, grappling with how to prepare for hurricane season. Seminole is a suburban county north of Orlando that is spliced through by the St. Johns River, Florida’s longest. The county has experienced flooding during several recent hurricanes, including Ian in 2022 and Milton in 2024.
The agency depends on forecasts from the National Weather Service and National Hurricane Center and assistance from FEMA after a storm has passed. It had applied for a grant for a new generator for a special needs shelter under the federal Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program, which Trump signed into law in 2020. But the Trump administration ended the program recently.
“We at the local level are going to make sure that our residents are taken care of regardless of what happens at the federal or state level,” Harris said. “We will need help. We just don’t know where that help is going to come from. But I have 100 percent confidence that there will be help whether it’s through mutual aid agreements or it’s from other states or our own state. We’re going to make sure our residents are taken care of.”

Memorial Day is a time to set aside our differences and join together in remembering and thanking those brave souls who gave their last full measure for their fellow Americans. They deserve that honor even for serving in what some thought to be an ill-advised conflict. Vietnam turned out to be such a war, but that cannot take away from the fact that the 58,220 service personnel who died in that war were answering the call of their country and doing it well.
On Memorial Day, we think of the almost 1,355,000 service personnel who have perished in the nation’s conflicts, starting with the 70,000 who died in the Revolutionary War. Since then, about 655,000 died on both sides of the Civil War. The death toll in World War I was 116,516 and 406,399 died in World War II. The vicious and almost forgotten Korean War saw 36,574 deaths. After Vietnam, 2,325 died in the War in Afghanistan and 4,492 in the Iraq War. May they all rest in peace.
But there are others we should hold in our hearts in addition to those who died in the war theaters. War has a way of inflicting mortal injuries that only take their toll on veterans after the guns are silenced. They include illnesses caused by exposure to toxins, like poisonous gas in WWI, Agent Orange in Vietnam and burn pit fumes in the Gulf War, Afghanistan and Iraq. Those toxins have resulted in untold deaths from a variety of cancers and other diseases. They are not counted on the official death tallies, but they nevertheless are directly attributable to combat conditions.

Many veterans have experienced health problems attributable to wartime conditions or know of others who have. It has been estimated that about 300,000 Vietnam veterans have died because of exposure to Agent Orange. The late Dan Eismann, my colleague of 12 years on the Idaho Supreme Court, received substantial exposure to Agent Orange during two tours in Vietnam. While on the Court, he developed non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and metastatic melanoma, passing away with honor last year. I was also exposed during my Vietnam service and developed pancreatic cancer in 2017. With surgery, chemo and a great deal of luck, I’ve been cured.
More recently, about 60,000 veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars are suffering and dying from medical ailments caused by exposure to toxins emanating from burn pits used to destroy all sorts of trash. Congress finally passed the PACT Act in 2022 to provide the necessary medical care, but the Act has not been funded for the current fiscal year. That is a serious breach of the country’s duty to those veterans.
There are many other serious problems that our veteran community faces on an all-too-frequent basis, including mental health issues, chronic substance abuse, suicide, traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder. There is obviously a lot of intermingling of these problems, but they present serious issues for many veterans.
While we can only honor the memories of the veterans who died in war zones, everyone concerned about our living veterans can take action to address problems presently confronting them. That could help to prevent future war-related deaths. When we see veterans in distress, we can reach out to them, provide a voice of caring and make a referral to a helpline for expert assistance.
Everyone can provide a service to our community of living veterans by speaking out on their behalf in public. We should inform members of our congressional delegation, as well as state and local leaders, that we expect them to advocate for preserving and protecting veterans and the benefits they have rightfully earned. The message must be that we will not put up with massive cuts of medical and support staffing at VA medical facilities. The lives and health of our veteran population must not be sacrificed based on unsupported claims of wasteful spending in veterans programs.
Our senators and congressmen should take aggressive action to maintain the current level of VA spending and to ensure funding of the PACT Act in the current budget fight. Funding must be restored for important programs designed to halt the war-related deaths of our veterans, including lifesaving cancer trials, mental health care, and suicide prevention. These essential programs, along with many others, must be restored, stabilized and adequately funded, in order to address war-related injuries and illnesses in our veteran population. They deserve nothing less.
On Memorial Day, May 26, let’s remember, honor and mourn those gallant Americans who gave their lives in service to this great country. We should also pay tribute to the veterans who died off of the battlefield because of war-related causes. And let’s resolve to do our utmost to prevent future loss of life for that veteran population.

(Credit: Tracey Attlee)More than 80 years after he died in the attack on Pearl Harbor, John Connolly was finally laid to rest – not as an unknown in a mass grave, but as a naval officer in Arlington National Cemetery. 
When the Navy first called to tell his daughter, Virginia Harbison, that her father’s remains had been identified, she hung up. At 91, living in assisted care in Texas, she could hardly believe it. It was her son, Bill Ingram, who called her back to share the news again. She was silent for so long that he had to ask if she was all right. “Bill,” she said, “I hadn’t thought about that for 60 years.”
She has lived the full life her father never had the chance to. In March, Ingram pushed his mother in her wheelchair to her father’s gravesite for the burial. 
“They fold the flag in this very tight, nice triangle, and then with white gloves, the commanding officer comes and takes it and kneels down and hands it to my mother,” said Ingram, who lives in San Francisco. “It was incredible.”
On Dec. 7, 1941 during the attack on Pearl Harbor, 429 service members aboard the USS Oklahoma died. Horrifyingly, men trapped below deck after the ship capsized could be heard tapping out “SOS” in Morse code as the air supply dwindled. Though 32 men were rescued, the rest were tragically not reached in time. 
After the war ended, the remains were recovered and buried in the National Cemetery of the Pacific in Hawaii, too water damaged and commingled to be identified individually. There they remained for years until modern science caught up with historical tragedy. 
The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency disinterred the USS Oklahoma remains in 2015 to send to a DNA laboratory. Carrie LeGarde, a forensic archaeologist with the agency and project lead for the Oklahoma Project, said her team started the process by testing small pieces of bone for maternal line DNA.

Since John Connolly was older than most of the men aboard the USS Oklahoma as one of the few officers on the ship and scheduled to retire just three weeks after the bombing, the team at DPAA relied on dental evidence in addition to DNA testing to confirm his identity. 
Connolly was born in Savannah in 1893 and joined the Navy in 1912. He served during World War I and was eventually promoted to a chief warrant officer. In 1941, his wife, Mary Connolly, and their two daughters, eight-year-old Virginia and six-year-old Helen were eagerly awaiting his return and retirement in Long Beach, California, when the Navy informed them he had died. 
Mary Connolly never remarried.

The State Historical Society of North Dakota has about 10,000 military items, but only about 5% is displayed at one time. The new North Dakota Military Gallery, planned for the state Capitol grounds in Bismarck, will be able to showcase more of the collection.
Brig. Gen. Jackie Huber, deputy adjutant general for the North Dakota National Guard, said one unique aspect of the new museum is that it will focus on North Dakota’s role in the military and the stories of state service members serving abroad and at home.


How to donate
For information on how to donate an item for the museum collection, visit the Historical Society’s website.


“We have a number of Medal of Honor recipients that I think most North Dakotans don’t even know the stories behind them,” Huber said. “We are also going to incorporate Native American stories of the warrior culture before statehood, so that’s really unique, too.”
A groundbreaking for the North Dakota Military Gallery is expected mid-summer, with completion planned for fall 2027.
In anticipation, the Historical Society is looking to fill some gaps in its military collection, said Lori Nohner, research historian at the State Historical Society of North Dakota.
The collection begins with the Civil War and goes all the way through the Global War on Terror to current military items.

The collection features a handful of uniforms worn by soldiers who fought in the Civil War and who moved to the Dakota Territory following the conflict. One uniform was worn by a member of the Dakota Territory Guard, which was a precursor to the state’s National Guard.
“This was a guy from Wisconsin who came to North Dakota and homesteaded, and then he went back to Wisconsin, but he stayed long enough to be in the Guard,” Nohner said.
The Historical Society also has a Spanish-American War cavalry uniform worn by former state lawmaker Leslie Simpson of Dickinson and a Navy officers peacoat from World War II, worn by Lt. William Guy of Devils Lake who later became the 26th governor of North Dakota.
Guy served as a gunnery officer on the U.S. Navy Destroyer William D. Porter, which was sunk by kamikaze pilots near Okinawa, Japan in 1945.
“His original uniform is at the bottom of the ocean, so this is his uniform from the rest of his service during World War II,” Nohner said.

The collection needs more Coast Guard uniforms and items from the Navy after the Korean War, Nohner said. The Historical Society also is seeking more uniforms worn by women, Native Americans and other minorities.
When people donate old military uniforms and fatigues, Nohner said they’re asked to provide a story about the service member and a photo of the person in the uniform to stand alongside the collection.
“You can get some information just looking at a uniform, but you can’t get the whole story,” Nohner said. “You can’t get the personal stories. The real meaty, interesting histories.”
Nohner said some of her favorite military items are the less ceremonial items, such as physical training sweatsuits. She said the Historical Society would accept an iPod used by a service member during a deployment, or even military-issued underwear, socks and other everyday items.
“They are so ubiquitous, but no one seems to donate them to a museum because they wear them out,” she said. “They keep wearing them. That’s why we don’t have many boots from World War I because the soldiers would wear them when they got home.”
Nohner said personal items have become increasingly difficult to find. More recent service members are less likely to have letters or photographs they sent home.
The Historical Society also has a need for more modern, American-made military weaponry, she said.
“We have a lot of foreign weapons from World War I especially because they were taken as souvenirs and the War Department divvied up a lot of war trophies … to the states based on how many people per capita served,” Nohner said.

People who donate items to the collection can make appointments at the Heritage Center to view their items in the collection vaults. 
“There’s still a lot of things that we’re preserving for the next generation that maybe don’t go up on exhibit, so we’re happy to show any donors the items that they donated,” Nohner said.
She added the storage spaces housing the military uniforms and other items are climate-controlled to keep the artifacts at the right temperature, in the best humidity conditions and lighting to prevent fading.
The Historical Society and the North Dakota National Guard have been consulting about the new gallery since October and working together to determine the displays and content for the new museum, Nohner said.
The total cost of the Military Gallery is estimated at $77.9 million, with about half of the funding coming from the state and half coming from private donations to the North Dakota National Guard Foundation.
Lawmakers so far have approved $19.2 million in state funding, with some of the allocation contingent on private donations being pledged. Legislators earlier this year also approved a $20 million Bank of North Dakota line of credit for the museum and directed the Historical Society to request funding in 2027 if the loan is used. 
Huber, who also serves as president of the North Dakota National Guard Foundation, said about $8 million in private donations have been raised out of the $40 million fundraising goal. She said many donors were waiting to see how much the state planned to contribute. Fundraisers also are working to secure larger donations from corporations involved in the defense industry.
“We have got a number of pending proposals,” Huber said. “Nobody has said, ‘No,’ to it, if you can believe that, which is pretty incredible.”
The Historical Society is continuing to add to its video collection of thousands of veterans’ oral histories. Veterans interested in making a testimonial should make an appointment at the Heritage Center to record the first-hand stories of their service time.
“Our goal is to have these last for hundreds and hundreds of years, not just for the next generation, this is for several more generations,” Nohner said.",https://northdakotamonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_1296edit-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-26 06:03:45.695262

(Courtesy of Honor and Remember Nebraska)OMAHA — It was a cold January day when an idea popped into Jim Meier’s head — why not plant a tree for every fallen soldier from Nebraska?
“It was just me talking to me,” said Meier, a Vietnam War veteran and tree lover, who jotted down the thought.
It’s a thought that has grown over three years into the planting of nearly 2,000 trees across the state as part of a “Nebraska Memorial Forest,” with small groves in Omaha, Lincoln, South Sioux City and Papillion.


Nebraska Memorial Forest

“It seems only worthy and appropriate to provide support and comfort for those who have fallen,” Meier said. “It’s such a small action we Nebraskans can take to pay tribute.”
The Omaha-based sports psychologist and development consultant has some experience in that realm already as director of Honor and Remember Nebraska, an all-volunteer nonprofit organization.
That group, founded in 2012, provides “honor and remember” flags for Gold Star families — those who have lost a loved one in active-duty military service — and “honor and sacrifice” flags for families who have lost a first responder or law enforcement officer.
Meier, 79, said the Memorial Forest trees are intended to be a “living memorial” to fallen heroes.
So far, 1,785 trees have been planted for the 7,500 soldiers, first responders and law enforcement officers “known” to have fallen.
On Memorial Day, Meier’s group will dedicate groves of 50 trees in Valentine and 70 in Bassett after dedicating 92 trees on May 17 that were planted last fall at Summit Lake State Recreation Area near Tekamah.
The first 60 Memorial Forest trees were planted in 2020 at Omaha’s Levi-Carter Park, and similar sized forests are now located in 15 other communities, from the Horning State Farm Demonstration Forest near Plattsmouth to along old Highway 2 that through south Lincoln.
Conversations, Meier said, are underway to plant new forests of at least 50 trees each in communities from Falls City to Scottsbluff and Beatrice to Aurora.
The group hopes to plant 1,500 new trees this year, and complete the project by 2030.
Meier said there’s a lot of analogies between military service and a grove of trees.
Trees were chosen and assigned to a plot of land — as are soldiers — he said, and while each tree is unique, there are many species and types that become stronger when working together as a grove or military unit.
Because there is no official data base of “fallen heroes,” he said the Memorial Forest group is always learning about someone new. They are added to the list, Meier said.
Each tree, typically six-feet-tall and of several, native varieties, costs about $300 each, money raised through donations or sponsorships.
For instance, the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission donated and planted the trees at Summit Lake, with the help of contributions by Tekamah native Ron Carson and his wife Jeanie. The Middle Niobrara Natural Resources District planted and will care for the trees at Valentine and Bassett.
Each tree is named for a military member, first responder or law enforcement officer who died while serving or from causes directly related from having served. Thus soldiers who died from exposure to Agent Orange or burn pits in Iraq are eligible.
Signage near the groves of trees features a QR code so that people can access a website that lists the location of each tree and the person associated with it, along with stories based on available information about them.
Eligibility extends back to the Spanish-American War of 1898.
Meier said he hopes the groves prove educational for those who visit the trees, as well as providing comfort for families and honoring those who made the ultimate sacrifice.

While the federal government protects animals listed under the Endangered Species Act, states are tasked with keeping the vast majority of other species out of the “emergency room.” Habitat loss, pollution and climate change are making that job much more difficult.
At the same time, states are finding it harder to count on the hunting and fishing revenues that have long funded most of their work. Agencies say they have more challenges than ever before, and less money to take them on.
In many states, lawmakers are rethinking the long-standing model for wildlife management. They’re considering new funding sources to make the agencies less reliant on license fees. They’re asking wildlife managers to expand their work beyond traditional “game” species, adding protections for threatened insects and other animals. And some are scrutinizing the commissions that have long governed wildlife management.
Some of the proposals have seen broad support from outdoors lovers who want to strengthen their wildlife agencies. Others have drawn opposition from sporting groups, who fear the new focus will diminish hunting and fishing opportunities.
“We’re seeing quite a bit of action this year,” said Logan Christian, wildlife and habitat specialist with the National Caucus of Environmental Legislators, a forum for state lawmakers. “We definitely have noticed that states are working on strengthening their wildlife agencies.”
As Stateline previously reported, New Mexico enacted the most sweeping overhaul this year. It renamed the Department of Game & Fish as the Department of Wildlife, giving it a more explicit focus on non-game species. Budget writers provided $10.5 million in new funding over the next three years to help threatened species. And lawmakers created a new process for appointing the agency’s commissioners, with guidelines ensuring a diversity of expertise and experience.
Wildlife advocates in other states say the New Mexico overhaul was a game changer. But lawmakers elsewhere are taking a more piecemeal approach.
Dollars
Numerous states are reconsidering their wildlife agencies’ funding model.
“There’s definitely a growing awareness that the current management system is outdated and really unfit for 21st century challenges,” said Michelle Lute, executive director of Wildlife for All, a nonprofit focused on overhauling state wildlife governance. “State wildlife agencies are seeing that they can’t rely on hunting and fishing license fees to be able to do this work.”

Earlier this year, lawmakers in Utah enacted a new tax on wind and solar projects that will help fund the state’s wildlife agency. The revenue could double the department’s funding to protect non-game species, from $5 million to $10 million.
“We have a funding model in place for game species,” said Paul Thompson, administrator of the Species Protection Account with the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources. “Funding to work on some of our native species programs has been really hard to come by.”
The new revenue could allow the agency to invest in more biologists, conservation easements, watershed restoration projects and native fish hatchery programs. State Rep. Casey Snider, the Republican who sponsored the bill, argued that the clean energy sector should pay because its development is harming Utah’s habitat.
“Wind and solar projects have an outsized impact on [non-game] species, and they have not been contributing financially,” he said.
But industry leaders said the law will threaten the state’s energy development.
“[The measure will] severely strain the economics of an existing project and send a negative message to developers and the financial institutions that provide capital for these projects,” said Theresa Foxley, chief of staff to rPlus Energies, a renewable developer, in testimony to lawmakers.
Lawmakers in Oregon are considering an increase to the state’s tax on hotel and short-term rental stays to help fund non-game wildlife work. The proposal would bring in about $30 million annually. State Rep. Ken Helm, the bill’s Democratic sponsor, said the state wildlife agency’s division to manage non-game species “has come and gone over the last 30 years as funding is available.”
Growing concerns about climate change and biodiversity have created urgency to find a stable funding source, he said. Helm said the lodging tax is a logical source, because the state’s tourism industry is centered on the outdoors. He noted that Oregon’s natural resources agencies receive only a tiny fraction of the state’s general revenue.
Travel and tourism groups oppose the bill, arguing it could drive visitors elsewhere. Helm has also proposed a bill that would bring in wildlife funding through an income tax increase.
He said his message to fellow lawmakers was: “I’ve given you two ways to get the money we need for this agency. Nobody’s been able to come up with a better idea. Just pick one.”
The bill was heard in committee earlier this month, but has not yet advanced.
Meanwhile, lawmakers in Hawaii approved a “green fee” — a lodging tax increase of 0.75% that Democratic Gov. Josh Green’s office estimates will bring in $100 million annually to help protect the state from climate change. While the fund is not explicitly focused on wildlife, it’s expected to contribute to efforts such as coral reef restoration and watershed protection that will benefit important habitats.
State Rep. Amy Perruso, a Democrat who was among the advocates for a green fee, said the COVID-19 pandemic was a wakeup call.
“With the absence of tourists, we saw a lot more fish in the ocean, everything about the environment was so much more healthy because we didn’t have 10 million extra people,” she said. “If we’re going to do something to protect the environment, [tourism] is a logical connection.”
Washington state was among the first to significantly invest in non-game conservation through state tax revenue, with legislation enacted two years ago. The budget passed by lawmakers this session continues that work, with $14 million set aside for biodiversity and species recovery each of the next two years.
Lawmakers in Kansas and North Carolina also proposed using more general fund revenue for wildlife work, although those measures have not advanced.
Mission
In other states, lawmakers are focused on expanding their wildlife agencies’ mission to more non-game species. Last year, Colorado gave wildlife managers the authority to manage insects and other invertebrates, as well as rare plants.
“Invertebrates are wildlife, and their conservation benefits the entire ecosystem, including the species [state wildlife officials] traditionally managed,” said Richard Reading, vice chair of the Colorado Parks and Wildlife Commission. “They do everything from creating our soils to filtering our water to pollinating the food we eat.”
Reading also serves as vice president of science and conservation at the Butterfly Pavilion, an insect zoo. He noted that studies are showing that many invertebrate species are in rapid decline. In addition to expanding the agency’s authority, lawmakers provided funding for six staff members to take on the additional work.
A similar bill in Nevada, focused on invertebrates, advanced through the Assembly’s natural resources committee.
“There’s definitely concerns about declines in pollinator species,” said Assemblymember Howard Watts, a Democrat who sponsored the bill. “Our wildlife agency can and should take proactive action to do research, surveys and habitat improvement to keep these species off the [endangered species list].”
Watts said the bill would allow wildlife managers to consider insects in state plans to protect imperiled species. He said the Nevada Department of Wildlife has requested an entomologist position if it’s asked to take on the additional species. Beyond that, he said, the measure would not require additional money, as it’s focused on voluntary, proactive work, rather than additional regulations.
Another bill in Pennsylvania would expand wildlife managers’ authority to include insects. That measure has been approved by the House Environmental and Natural Resources Protection Committee.
Sporting groups have largely been supportive of efforts to provide new funding sources to manage non-game species. But some are skeptical of plans to expand agencies’ mission without an increase in revenue.
“Most hunters and anglers understand that healthy game populations are dependent on ecosystem integrity,” said Devin O’Dea, Western policy and conservation manager with Backcountry Hunters & Anglers, a nonprofit focused on public lands. “But when you take a model that’s been developed with the intent of enforcing regulations for fish and game species, expand that scope without funding and additional capacity, it’s a recipe for something to fall off the plate.”
Governance
Meanwhile, some legislators want to rethink the commission model that oversees wildlife governance. Critics say that governors often select commissioners who are hunting guides, farmers and political donors. Once appointed, they enact wildlife policies to suit their economic interests.
Florida state Rep. Anna V. Eskamani, a Democrat, drafted a bill that would overhaul the state’s Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. Her proposal would increase the board from seven to nine members. It would designate seats for scientists, conservationists, local officials, farmers, hunters and anglers.
“The commission has made decisions not based on science or conservation, but based on developers or landowners that engage in agricultural practices,” she said. “We tried to strike a balance to ensure there are voices with an environmental background, with a conservation and wildlife background, with an academic background.”
The bill did not advance, but Eskamani said grassroots support is building for systemic changes in wildlife management.
Some sporting groups are more wary of commission overhaul proposals.
“We have seen examples where proposed changes to commissions were politically motivated or motivated by anti-hunting and anti-angling interests,” said Kent Keene senior manager for Western states and agriculture policy with the Congressional Sportsmen’s Foundation, a group that promotes hunting and fishing priorities on Capitol Hill. “When those changes are focused on science-based needs, then the sportsmen’s community has a long history of supporting those steps to ensure we are protecting our heritage.”
Some hunting and fishing groups have emphasized that the expanded mission should come with additional funding, so agencies aren’t stretched thin. Keene noted that hunters and anglers pay an excise tax on the purchase of gear, which provides an important funding source for wildlife agencies. Some have proposed a similar “backpack tax” on gear for hikers, birdwatchers and others.
Another proposal in New Hampshire would give the wildlife agency’s executive director the authority to make policy decisions, relegating the Fish and Game Commission to an advisory body. That bill did not advance.

Bliss in El Paso, Texas on Armed Forces Day was an important occasion. Veterans Day and Memorial Day were revered in a city where the military presence was strong. Recent politicians have called for replacing these solemn occasions with holidays celebrating American victories in World War I and World War II. To do that would be to undermine what makes the Armed Forces Day, Memorial Day, and Veterans Day special.
This is not to knock America’s performance in both world wars. It was impressive what Americans were able to accomplish.  In fact, I’ve written columns about our victories in these conflicts. I was even criticized by some readers for my verbal attacks on Nazis for their killing of U.S. P.O.W.s and pretending to surrender in order to kill more G.I.s (I was accused of spreading “propaganda.”  I’ve written how we should honor American generals, not praise Nazi Generals.
But Armed Forces Day is about honoring all active-duty military. Veterans Day is for recognizing the living veterans who served this country. And Memorial Day is about commemorating those who gave their lives in defense of this country.
Making May 8 “Victory Day for World War II” completely ignores those who still had plenty of fighting in the Pacific. I would recommend the politician who suggested it should study the Battle of Okinawa, and see what our U.S. Marines and Army accomplished in that fight, which lasted until June 22. That politician should watch “Hacksaw Ridge,” and learn what happened to the sailors who suffered from a massive Kamikaze attack, as well as the pilots who took on the massive Japanese battleship Yamato. All in all, 12,000 Americans and General Simon Bolivar Buckner Jr. died, while another 36,000 suffered wounds. There’s no word on how many were afflicted with terrible memories of that conflict, which did not conclude until well after V-E Day.
To replace Veterans Day with “Victory Day” set off a colleague of mine, a veteran who earned two Purple Hearts and a Bronze Star in Vietnam. “So how about a day for Korea?” he texted me. “Guess, technically that one isn’t over. Panama? Invasion but not really a war. But didn’t we win in Panama? Shouldn’t we celebrate that? Desert Storm? Wasn’t that a win? What else? Maybe we could….have a big military parade on every one of them? Isn’t that how you’re supposed to celebrate a victory?”
He wasn’t done, by a long shot. “And since it’s all about wins now and not really about honoring veterans, no more uncomfortable visits to cemeteries and VA hospitals? Wars are or should be last resort solutions to perceived problems. We had it right. Focus on the people who have served our country, often at great risk and sacrifice, by individuals, including sometimes the ultimate sacrifice. Why can’t we just continue to recognize that? People who only think in terms of wins and losses should stick to football and leave the analysis of a war to adults who have a clue of what war is like and what it does to people and to a country. But that kind of history makes some people uncomfortable and heaven forbid that anyone should ever have to be uncomfortable and have to think about anything that might upset them.”
He continued in perhaps the longest text I have ever received. “You know, I have a bias when it comes to war. Having known and having had serious conversations about serious things with friends whose names are now inscribed on a wall up in D.C. probably does that.”
For those who still serve, served in the past, and those who paid the ultimate price, let’s preserve Armed Forces Day, Veterans Day, and Memorial Day instead of changing these for political purposes. It’s the least we can do for them.

More than 80 years after he died in the attack on Pearl Harbor, John Connolly was finally laid to rest – not as an unknown in a mass grave, but as a naval officer in Arlington National Cemetery. 
When the Navy first called to tell his daughter, Virginia Harbison, that her father’s remains had been identified, she hung up. At 91, living in assisted care in Texas, she could hardly believe it. It was her son, Bill Ingram, who called her back to share the news again. She was silent for so long that he had to ask if she was all right. “Bill,” she said, “I hadn’t thought about that for 60 years.”
She has lived the full life her father never had the chance to. In March, Ingram pushed his mother in her wheelchair to her father’s gravesite for the burial. 
“They fold the flag in this very tight, nice triangle, and then with white gloves, the commanding officer comes and takes it and kneels down and hands it to my mother,” said Ingram, who lives in San Francisco. “It was incredible.”

On Dec. 7, 1941 during the attack on Pearl Harbor, 429 service members aboard the USS Oklahoma died. Horrifyingly, men trapped below deck after the ship capsized could be heard tapping out “SOS” in Morse code as the air supply dwindled. Though 32 men were rescued, the rest were tragically not reached in time. 
After the war ended, the remains were recovered and buried in the National Cemetery of the Pacific in Hawaii, too water damaged and commingled to be identified individually. There they remained for years until modern science caught up with historical tragedy. 
The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency disinterred the USS Oklahoma remains in 2015 to send to a DNA laboratory. Carrie LeGarde, a forensic archaeologist with the agency and project lead for the Oklahoma Project, said her team started the process by testing small pieces of bone for maternal line DNA. Overall, they inventoried 13,000 bones and took 4,900 DNA samples. For Connolly, identification was complicated. 
“We had several sequences that had multiple individuals, and that was actually the case with John Connolly, and part of why his identification occurred later in the project,” she said.
Since John Connolly was older than most of the men aboard the USS Oklahoma as one of the few officers on the ship and scheduled to retire just three weeks after the bombing, the team at DPAA relied on dental evidence in addition to DNA testing to confirm his identity. 
Connolly was born in Savannah in 1893 and joined the Navy in 1912. He served during World War I and was eventually promoted to a chief warrant officer. In 1941, his wife, Mary Connolly, and their two daughters, eight-year-old Virginia and six-year-old Helen were eagerly awaiting his return and retirement in Long Beach, California, when the Navy informed them he had died. 
Mary Connolly never remarried. 
“She was very sad all her life because she married at age 30 or 31 and her husband was away in the service, but was killed right before he was supposed to retire,” Ingram said. 
Connolly’s memory has been passed down through the generations.
“We’ve taken my family to Hawaii, and we went to the memorial and found the marker for his name,” Ingram said. 
Everything changed last year when Ingram got a call from the Navy. In a 200-page report, the Navy detailed the historical background, identification process and scientific evidence.
“With the research that was involved, both with historical research and medical research, there’s a lot of folks at DPAA that are involved,” Navy POW/MIA branch head Richard Jenkins said. “We as a service will explain that to the family, with the hopes of them feeling comfortable with the findings and showing them that it’s not just any set of remains, it’s actually going to be that person.”

There’s a story that runs in Ingram’s family about his grandfather. A couple of years after World War II, a young man knocked on the family home and introduced himself to Virginia and Mary Connolly. He had been on the USS Oklahoma with John Connolly, he said, and when the ship was hit, Connolly pushed open a hatch and forced him out. Connolly had saved his life. 
In 1944, the Navy re-commissioned one of their ships as the USS John Connolly. Though his story was a tragic one — an officer who never returned home whose remains were left unknown — history has granted him a second chance at closure. Over eight decades later, he got the hero’s burial he deserved. 
“They did everything. They had a band. They played Taps. They fired the guns,” Ingram said. “Seven soldiers fired three times for a 21-gun salute.” 
A final sendoff at last.

(Darwin Fan/Getty Images) Memorial Day is a time to set aside our differences and join together in remembering and thanking those brave souls who gave their last full measure for their fellow Americans. They deserve that honor even for serving in what some thought to be an ill-advised conflict. Vietnam turned out to be such a war, but that cannot take away from the fact that the 58,220 service personnel who died in that war were answering the call of their country and doing it well.
On Memorial Day, we think of the almost 1,355,000 service personnel who have perished in the nation’s conflicts, starting with the 70,000 who died in the Revolutionary War. Since then, about 655,000 died on both sides of the Civil War. The death toll in World War I was 116,516, and 406,399 died in World War II. The vicious and almost forgotten Korean War saw 36,574 deaths. After Vietnam, 2,325 died in the War in Afghanistan and 4,492 in the Iraq War. May they all rest in peace.
But there are others we should hold in our hearts in addition to those who died in the war theaters. War has a way of inflicting mortal injuries that only take their toll on veterans after the guns are silenced. They include illnesses caused by exposure to toxins, like poisonous gas in WWI, Agent Orange in Vietnam and burn pit fumes in the Gulf War, Afghanistan and Iraq. Those toxins have resulted in untold deaths from a variety of cancers and other diseases. They are not counted on the official death tallies, but they nevertheless are directly attributable to combat conditions.

Many veterans have experienced health problems attributable to wartime conditions or know of others who have. It has been estimated that about 300,000 Vietnam veterans have died because of exposure to Agent Orange. The late Dan Eismann, my colleague of 12 years on the Idaho Supreme Court, received substantial exposure to Agent Orange during two tours in Vietnam. While on the  ourt, he developed non-Hodgkin lymphoma and metastatic melanoma, passing away with honor last year. 
I was also exposed during my Vietnam service and developed pancreatic cancer in 2017. With surgery, chemo and a great deal of luck, I’ve been cured.

More recently, about 60,000 veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars are suffering and dying from medical ailments caused by exposure to toxins emanating from burn pits used to destroy all sorts of trash. Congress finally passed the PACT Act in 2022 to provide the necessary medical care, but the act has not been funded for the current fiscal year. That is a serious breach of the country’s duty to those veterans.
There are many other serious problems that our veteran community faces on an all-too-frequent basis, including mental health issues, chronic substance abuse, suicide, traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress. There is obviously a lot of intermingling of these problems, but they present serious issues for many veterans.
While we can only honor the memories of the veterans who died in war zones, everyone concerned about our living veterans can take action to address problems presently confronting them. That could help to prevent future war-related deaths. When we see veterans in distress, we can reach out to them, provide a voice of caring and make a referral to a helpline for expert assistance.
Everyone can provide a service to our community of living veterans by speaking out on their behalf in public. We should inform members of our congressional delegation, as well as state and local leaders, that we expect them to advocate for preserving and protecting veterans and the benefits they have rightfully earned. 
The message must be that we will not put up with massive cuts of medical and support staffing at VA medical facilities. The lives and health of our veteran population must not be sacrificed based on unsupported claims of wasteful spending in veterans programs.
Our senators and congressmen should take aggressive action to maintain the current level of VA spending and to ensure funding of the PACT Act in the current budget fight. Funding must be restored for important programs designed to halt the war-related deaths of our veterans, including lifesaving cancer trials, mental health care, and suicide prevention. 
These essential programs, along with many others, must be restored, stabilized and adequately funded, in order to address war-related injuries and illnesses in our veteran population. They deserve nothing less.
On Memorial Day, May 26, let’s remember, honor and mourn those gallant Americans who gave their lives in service to this great country. We should also pay tribute to the veterans who died off of the battlefield because of war-related causes. And let’s resolve to do our utmost to prevent future loss of life for that veteran population.

More than 80 years after he died in the attack on Pearl Harbor, John Connolly was finally laid to rest – not as an unknown in a mass grave, but as a naval officer in Arlington National Cemetery. 
When the Navy first called to tell his daughter, Virginia Harbison, that her father’s remains had been identified, she hung up. At 91, living in assisted care in Texas, she could hardly believe it. It was her son, Bill Ingram, who called her back to share the news again. She was silent for so long that he had to ask if she was all right. “Bill,” she said, “I hadn’t thought about that for 60 years.”
She has lived the full life her father never had the chance to. In March, Ingram pushed his mother in her wheelchair to her father’s gravesite for the burial. 
“They fold the flag in this very tight, nice triangle, and then with white gloves, the commanding officer comes and takes it and kneels down and hands it to my mother,” said Ingram, who lives in San Francisco. “It was incredible.”
On Dec. 7, 1941 during the attack on Pearl Harbor, 429 service members aboard the USS Oklahoma died. Horrifyingly, men trapped below deck after the ship capsized could be heard tapping out “SOS” in Morse code as the air supply dwindled. Though 32 men were rescued, the rest were tragically not reached in time.

After the war ended, the remains were recovered and buried in the National Cemetery of the Pacific in Hawaii, too water damaged and commingled to be identified individually. There they remained for years until modern science caught up with historical tragedy. 
The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency disinterred the USS Oklahoma remains in 2015 to send to a DNA laboratory. Carrie LeGarde, a forensic archaeologist with the agency and project lead for the Oklahoma Project, said her team started the process by testing small pieces of bone for maternal line DNA. Overall, they inventoried 13,000 bones and took 4,900 DNA samples. For Connolly, identification was complicated. 
“We had several sequences that had multiple individuals, and that was actually the case with John Connolly, and part of why his identification occurred later in the project,” she said.
Since John Connolly was older than most of the men aboard the USS Oklahoma as one of the few officers on the ship and scheduled to retire just three weeks after the bombing, the team at DPAA relied on dental evidence in addition to DNA testing to confirm his identity. 
Connolly was born in Savannah in 1893 and joined the Navy in 1912. He served during World War I and was eventually promoted to a chief warrant officer. In 1941, his wife, Mary Connolly, and their two daughters, eight-year-old Virginia and six-year-old Helen were eagerly awaiting his return and retirement in Long Beach, California, when the Navy informed them he had died. 
Mary Connolly never remarried. 
“She was very sad all her life because she married at age 30 or 31 and her husband was away in the service, but was killed right before he was supposed to retire,” Ingram said. 
Connolly’s memory has been passed down through the generations.
“We’ve taken my family to Hawaii, and we went to the memorial and found the marker for his name,” Ingram said. 
Everything changed last year when Ingram got a call from the Navy. In a 200-page report, the Navy detailed the historical background, identification process and scientific evidence.

“With the research that was involved, both with historical research and medical research, there’s a lot of folks at DPAA that are involved,” Navy POW/MIA branch head Richard Jenkins said. “We as a service will explain that to the family, with the hopes of them feeling comfortable with the findings and showing them that it’s not just any set of remains, it’s actually going to be that person.”
There’s a story that runs in Ingram’s family about his grandfather. A couple of years after World War II, a young man knocked on the family home and introduced himself to Virginia and Mary Connolly. He had been on the USS Oklahoma with John Connolly, he said, and when the ship was hit, Connolly pushed open a hatch and forced him out. Connolly had saved his life. 
In 1944, the Navy re-commissioned one of their ships as the USS John Connolly. Though his story was a tragic one – an officer who never returned home whose remains were left unknown – history has granted him a second chance at closure. Over eight decades later, he got the hero’s burial he deserved. 
“They did everything. They had a band. They played Taps. They fired the guns,” Ingram said. “Seven soldiers fired three times for a 21-gun salute.”

While their friends are cannonballing into the city pool this weekend, my sons will spend the day in an Eastern Kentucky cemetery, placing flowers on the graves of relatives they never knew.
We are going back home on Decoration Day — a folk tradition practiced by generations of Appalachians and Southerners dedicated to visiting cemeteries where their families are buried to clean and decorate their graves, and often to attend a religious service and dinner on the cemetery grounds.
Like most who grew up in Eastern Kentucky, I’ve been practicing various rites of Decoration Day all my life. I loved the reunions, playing with my cousins, and filling plates of food and desserts. Although, I admit: I have often seen the other parts of Decoration Day as an unnecessary effort, one I had little interest in carrying on. What good was there in spending money on artificial flowers for people who would never know you made the gesture?
Yet this year, something changed. Perhaps it was turning 40, or the reckoning of the pandemic, or both, that made Decoration Day seem urgent and important not only to observe, but to pass down to my children.
As my perspective changed, my interest grew and sent me seeking answers, both historical and personal, about the cultural tradition, its origins, and why I felt a sudden urge to drag my three children to a cemetery on their first week of summer vacation.
 What Is Decoration Day?

In Ohio, the streets of my small town are lined with tiny American flags. Living near a military base, with many active-duty and retired U.S. Air Force neighbors, I am keenly aware of the reverence paid to Memorial Day. Each year, I’d find myself asking my friends, “We always called it Decoration Day. We decorated everyone’s graves. Did you?” The answer was, with rare exception, no. Secretly, I worried if somehow I had incorrectly celebrated a patriotic holiday. Was this the same as not knowing I needed to illuminate a flag at night or take it down in the rain? Did we get this wrong? Had we expanded it selfishly to include everyone when we should have been only honoring those who died in battle?
For insight, I turned to the book “Decoration Day in the Mountains,” by folklorist Alan Jabbour, founding director of the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress.
Jabbour’s thorough exploration of Decoration Day relieved me of my concerns and filled me with a new appreciation for history and rituals.

Decoration Day, Jabbour wrote, actually inspired Memorial Day, pre-dating any post-Civil War celebration in the South or North. Before the war, Appalachians and Southerners were already practicing what they called Decoration Day, also called “a decoration,”  which involved an annual “cleaning of community cemeteries, decorating them with flowers, and holding a religious service in the cemetery, often with “dinner on the ground.” Families spent weeks leading up to Decoration Day making buds and petals from bright crepe paper, cleaning the cemeteries.
His research also softened my other silent concern that Decoration Day was tied up in celebrating the Confederacy. Jabbour explains that two early and unrelated celebrations of the Confederate dead — one in Charleston, South Carolina, and the other in Petersburg, Virginia — both using the word “decoration” and both using flowers, led Jabbour to the conclude that organizers of the events each drew upon an existing tradition.
After reading Jabbour’s book, I called my grandmother, with whom I had tagged along to the cemetery, reunions and flower-buying expeditions. It was she who had carried the duty of Decoration Day to me, and I wanted to know why.
 ‘I was kindly like your youngins‘

One question from me about Decoration Day transports my grandmother back to her childhood — and ties me to the generations that came before me.
“Can you tell me what you remember about Decoration Day?”
From the old days?
“Yes.”





It used to be a big day for people. When I was a little girl, my grandma would start in her spare time … and make crepe paper flowers. She usually made them out of bright red and turquoise and bright pink and white crepe paper. They would make a bud, and cut out petals, and take a knife to the petal and scrape the end of it to make it lay down and curl. They would have their wire, and put that bud on the end of the wire, and start with the little petals and tie them on.
It was about two-and-a-half  miles to that cemetery. Grandpa would always walk, and grandma would be on the horse. She would have a basket full of fried chicken, maybe fried pies, and cake, just food like that. And me, I was always running. We cut through the hills instead of going on the main road … we’d come down so far out of that hollow and then cut through the hill. When you go through the hills there’s wild honeysuckle, the prettiest orange, and as you go up through there, there are pine trees … and it smells like pine all the way through there. It was where grandma’s babies were buried, ones who died when they were born, and her son who died when he was 21.
They’d sing, decorate graves, and talk, a lot of them hadn’t seen each other in a month or a few weeks.
They had a preacher; he always, at least to me, preached too long. I would get so hot and tired that I just wanted to hurry up and get gone. …
I’ll be honest with you, I was kindly like your youngins, I never was still.  As far as standing around and watching what everybody did, I just sure didn’t. But I do remember decorating the graves. I think it’s important to decorate.			


Hearing her stories made it clear: Decoration Day, for me, was the remembering, linking myself and my children to the generations before us.
As I grow older, and as a pandemic has brought the fragility of life into clear focus, I’m buoyed by the remembering, by the traditions that connect the present, future and past. To quote Alan Jabbour, “At the deepest spiritual level, a decoration is an act of respect for the dead that reaffirms one’s bonds with those who have gone before.”
And so today, my children will carry the flowers over the hillside to the graves of their great-grandfather, great-great grandparents and other relatives.
We’ll make sure to place a small bouquet on the stone of my grandfather’s little brother, who died as an infant.
They’ll listen to our stories as we walk around the cemetery, and I hope, feel connected to the people who came before them.
They will get hot, tired, and bored.
Like their great-grandmother 80 years before them, they will want us to hurry up and get gone.
But someday, maybe they will want to come back.

(Tim Lambert/Pennsylvania Capital-Star)When I began teaching courses on homelessness and poverty at Gettysburg College more than 20 years ago, I regularly noted to my students that I often found common cause with a wide range of people from across the political spectrum when it came to seeking solutions and providing services for homeless veterans.
While some people certainly still make the right noises in this regard, the current obsession with wiping the slate of the federal government clean and starting from scratch now is putting many veterans at-risk.
Homelessness is a tragedy that affects far too many Americans, and the reality is that“[h]omelessness remains more common among veterans compared to non-veterans.” Veterans are especially vulnerable to a number of risk factors related to homelessness, including substance abuse, PTSD, mental health issues, low income, and economic instability.
Unfortunately, veterans who fall into homelessness are also particularly prone to remaining unhoused, as research indicates that, “98% of homeless veterans have a chronic pattern of homelessness.” As the Pennsylvania Department of Military and Veterans Affairs notes in this regard: “For some, taking off the uniform and acclimating to a non-military life comes with social challenges and can ultimately lead to hard times, such as being homeless. U.S. military veterans are estimated to make up a large portion – 11 percent – of homeless adults.”
Although PTSD and related disorders certainly loom large amongst the risk factors for veteran homelessness, it is important to keep in mind that the number one reason for homelessness in America today is actually the lack of affordable housing. As reported in the Independent in its recent coverage of Elon Musk’s baseless claim that “the word ‘homeless’ is a ‘lie’ and ‘a propaganda word,’” the reality in the United States today is that “[t]he primary driver of homelessness, particularly among families, is a lack of stable affordable housing, with evictions, overcrowded housing, domestic violence and job losses sending homeless families into shelters and onto the streets.”
Currently, the curtailing of rental assistance seems poised to tip tens of thousands more Americans out of housing. Experts suggest that many of us are more vulnerable to such risks than we’d like to imagine, and veterans are especially so. Given this reality, it is particularly alarming that under the Trump Administration, the VA recently “has ended a new mortgage-rescue program that so far has helped about 20,000 veterans avoid foreclosure and keep their homes.”
As did the Obama Administration before him, Trump has claimed that he will end veteran homelessness. It is only fair to note that the Obama Administration had some successes in striving towards that goal. In this current environment, however, it is difficult to reconcile Trump’s rhetoric in this regard with sweeping executive actions demolishing some of the key federal players in this effort. To cite one staggering recent example, “[t]he US Interagency Council on Homelessness, which helps coordinate federal housing aid to cities, was targeted for elimination by a Trump executive order in March.” Moreover, according to the New York Times, the president seeks to end permanent supportive housing for an estimated 300,000 people considered chronically homeless. Many are veterans.
Veterans are more vulnerable than the general population to the sweeping demolishment of the federal government. This is not simply because the “Department of Veterans Affairs is planning to cut 83,000 jobs, slashing employment by over 17% at the federal agency that provides health care for millions of veterans” It is also in part because “nearly 30% of federal workers are veterans, half of whom are disabled. This means that veterans, who make up 6.1% of the U.S. population, are disproportionately affected by federal worker cuts.”
Because the vast bulk of the VA workforce provides veteran healthcare, “cuts to VA workers mean cuts to health care.” Since veterans as a group rely so heavily on Medicaid, cuts to that program disproportionately disadvantage veterans. Furthermore, because “[w]orking-age veterans face an elevated risk of experiencing food insecurity compared to their nonveteran peers,” cuts to food assistance programs also hit veterans harder than other groups.
  The Iron Mike statue overlooks the La Fiere bridge in Normandy, France. (Tim Lambert/Pennsylvania Capital-Star).
The news is not all bad, and in our own region in Pennsylvania, efforts to help house homeless Vets have been laudable and even inspiring. For example, a tiny home project for veterans experiencing homelessness opened last year in Harrisburg. In addition, the commonwealth offers VETConnect Services, and there are a number of local private organizations dedicated to helping veterans at risk of homelessness. This includes a dedicated veteran aspect of the 211 program, which allows those in need of services to dial 211 to find help.
In the end, though, only on the national level can we find the resources to coordinate efforts and to tackle challenges on this scale. In any case, it is only reasonable to expect the federal government that recruited and ordered these veterans into harm’s way to take the lead in seeking to offer them whatever services they need.
I am a Pennsylvania Quaker, a member of the pacifist religious organization that founded this Commonwealth. Quakers do not embrace military service, to be sure, but we do embrace ideals of honor, service, and integrity, and we believe strongly in honoring social contracts.
If someone feels moved by their conscience to perform military service and is true to their ideals, I do not condemn that person. Indeed, many such folks number amongst my closest friends, and even some of my family members. I believe that those who serve this country selflessly in any capacity deserve recognition and support for doing so, and not merely in terms of lip service.
If a veteran’s military experience results in the need for special accommodations, medical care, drug or alcohol rehabilitation, housing assistance, or similar services, I think that we should take special care to meet such needs.
My own father, a proud veteran of the U.S. Army, died homeless in 1988. He was a chronic alcoholic and estranged from his family, so I am sure that there are those out there who will claim that he brought his fate upon himself. I have always maintained, however, that we can do better as a nation, and that civilized people care for the most vulnerable amongst the population without regard to blame or shame.
I have spent much of my adult life trying my best to live this truth, through regular active service in my community, through educational opportunities for my students, and through leadership roles on boards and within service organizations.
Veterans Day was established to remember those who have fallen in defense of this country. Let us also remember on that day those who have served with honor but have fallen on hard times.

By most common measures, the life of Adriana Smith ended three months ago, when a tragic series of undiagnosed blood clots left her brain dead, with no hope of recovery. Yet today, in a hospital room in Midtown Atlanta, Adriana’s body is still being kept alive by machines, without regard to her family’s wishes.
As someone who has been there, I know how difficult and extremely personal that decision can be, but I can only imagine what it must be like to have that choice stripped away, as it has been stripped away from Adriana’s loved ones by people who don’t know them, who know little of their circumstances and deal with none of its consequences.
In Adriana’s case, she was nine weeks pregnant at the time the blood clots hit, which under some readings of Georgia law has meant that what remains of Adriana’s body is now under government control until the fetus can be safely extracted.
“She’s been breathing through machines for more than 90 days,” April Newkirk, Adriana’s mother, told 11Alive News. “It’s torture for me. I see my daughter breathing, but she’s not there.”
Doctors and lawyers at Emory Healthcare – but mainly the lawyers, I suspect – say that under Georgia’s anti-abortion law, they are required to keep Adriana’s body functioning as the fetus inside her develops. They are erring on the side of caution – not medical caution, but legal caution.
The law in question is the “Living Infants Fairness and Equality Act.” or the LIFE Act.

  Sen. Ed Setzler (Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder)
The main sponsor of that law, state Sen. Ed Setzler, R-Acworth, says it’s working as intended in this case.
“I’m proud that the hospital recognizes the full value of the small human life living inside of this regrettably dying young mother,” Setzler told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. “Mindful of the agony of this young mother’s family, the wisdom of modern medical science to be able to save the life of a healthy unborn child is something that I trust in future years will lead to great joy, with this child having a chance to grow into vibrant adulthood.”
Proud as he might be, Setzler isn’t the one who has to watch what’s left of his daughter lay lifeless in that hospital room, not alive exactly, with machines performing basic life functions, week after week. He isn’t the one who has to explain what’s happening to his seven-year-old grandson, Adriana’s son. If the fetus survives, he also isn’t the one who will have to raise the child. Doctors have warned Adriana’s family that the fetus has fluid on its brain, with unknown consequences.
“She’s pregnant with my grandson,” Newkirk said. “But he may be blind, may not be able to walk, may not survive once he’s born,” she said. “This decision should’ve been left to us.”
According to Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr, however, Emory Healthcare and Setzler are misreading the legislation.
“There is nothing in the LIFE Act that requires medical professionals to keep a woman on life support after brain death,” his office said in a statement. “Removing life support is not an action ‘with the purpose to terminate a pregnancy’.”
Carr’s reading of the law seems to be correct. As his statement indicates, the law defines abortion as “the act of using, prescribing, or administering any instrument, substance, device, or other means with the purpose to terminate a pregnancy,” and the withdrawal of extraordinary life-maintenance measures on a brain-dead woman would not fall within its restrictions.
But this is the problem when you try to write a law into black and white, when you try to legislate what is right and what is wrong when dealing with decisions that are so personal, so intimate. Moral certainty sounds good, it may feel good, it may play well in a political campaign, but it cannot possibly make such hard choices from a distance. The law cannot act more wisely or with more love than would those who know the situation best.

On Dec. 7, 1941, during the attack on Pearl Harbor, 429 service members aboard the USS Oklahoma died. Horrifyingly, men trapped below deck after the ship capsized could be heard tapping out “SOS” in Morse code as the air supply dwindled. Though 32 men were rescued, the rest were tragically not reached in time. 
After the war ended, the remains were recovered and buried in the National Cemetery of the Pacific in Hawaii, too water damaged and commingled to be identified individually. There they remained for years until modern science caught up with historical tragedy. 
The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency disinterred the USS Oklahoma remains in 2015 to send to a DNA laboratory. Carrie LeGarde, a forensic archaeologist with the agency and project lead for the Oklahoma Project, said her team started the process by testing small pieces of bone for maternal line DNA. Overall, they inventoried 13,000 bones and took 4,900 DNA samples. For Connolly, identification was complicated. 
“We had several sequences that had multiple individuals, and that was actually the case with John Connolly, and part of why his identification occurred later in the project,” she said.

Since John Connolly was older than most of the men aboard the USS Oklahoma as one of the few officers on the ship and scheduled to retire just three weeks after the bombing, the team at DPAA relied on dental evidence in addition to DNA testing to confirm his identity. 
Connolly was born in Savannah in 1893 and joined the Navy in 1912. He served during World War I and was eventually promoted to a chief warrant officer. In 1941, his wife, Mary Connolly, and their two daughters, eight-year-old Virginia and six-year-old Helen were eagerly awaiting his return and retirement in Long Beach, California, when the Navy informed them he had died. 
Mary Connolly never remarried. 
“She was very sad all her life because she married at age 30 or 31 and her husband was away in the service, but was killed right before he was supposed to retire,” Ingram said. 
Connolly’s memory has been passed down through the generations.
“We’ve taken my family to Hawaii, and we went to the memorial and found the marker for his name,” Ingram said. 
Everything changed last year when Ingram got a call from the Navy. In a 200-page report, the Navy detailed the historical background, identification process and scientific evidence.
“With the research that was involved, both with historical research and medical research, there’s a lot of folks at DPAA that are involved,” Navy POW/MIA branch head Richard Jenkins said. “We as a service will explain that to the family, with the hopes of them feeling comfortable with the findings and showing them that it’s not just any set of remains, it’s actually going to be that person.”
There’s a story that runs in Ingram’s family about his grandfather. A couple of years after World War II, a young man knocked on the family home and introduced himself to Virginia and Mary Connolly. He had been on the USS Oklahoma with John Connolly, he said, and when the ship was hit, Connolly pushed open a hatch and forced him out. Connolly had saved his life. 
In 1944, the Navy re-commissioned one of their ships as the USS John Connolly. Though his story was a tragic one — an officer who never returned home whose remains were left unknown — history has granted him a second chance at closure. Over eight decades later, he got the hero’s burial he deserved. 
“They did everything. They had a band. They played Taps. They fired the guns,” Ingram said. “Seven soldiers fired three times for a 21-gun salute.” 
A final sendoff at last.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-26 09:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,CT child tax credit still possible as budget talks hit home stretch,Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/26/ct-budget-child-tax-credit/,"Democratic leaders are cautiously optimistic about one popular tax-cutting idea: A $150-per-child tax credit, up to $450 per household.","State legislators are focused mainly on spending now, trimming their requests to compromise soon with Gov. Ned Lamont on a new two-year budget.
But with just over one week left in the 2025 session, one popular tax-cutting idea is still alive: a new credit for low- and middle-income households with children.
Leaders of the Senate and House Democratic majorities were cautiously optimistic about the child tax credit, though the full program likely would need to be phased in over several years.
The initial $150 per child income tax break under consideration would cost state government $83 million per year, even as looming federal Medicaid cuts could cost Connecticut hundreds of millions in annual revenue. But given the unprecedented surpluses the state has amassed since 2017 and the extremely conservative revenue growth the Lamont administration has projected during its six years, lawmakers say Connecticut can afford this relief.
“We are trying very hard to protect that tax credit the best that we can,” said House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford.
“It still is a reasonable objective,” said Senate President Pro Tem Martin M. Looney, D-New Haven, who said working families here needed more relief long before President Donald J. Trump and Congress began planning huge cutbacks in Medicaid, food stamps and other social assistance programs.
“The pressures [on working families] are going to be extreme, and we hear all the time about the potential Draconian, punitive choices” federal cutbacks will force upon them, Looney added.
Lamont’s budget spokesman, Chris Collibee, said only that tax proposals remain part of ongoing budget negotiations among the administration and legislative leaders. The governor proposed boosting a different state income tax credit, one that offsets a portion of municipal property tax bills, from $300 to $350, while also broadening eligibility. 
Connecticut is the only state with a broad-based personal income tax that doesn’t account for the cost of raising children. Many Democratic lawmakers here largely have endorsed offering a $600-per-dependent credit with relief capped at $1,800 per household.
But because of the uncertainty surrounding federal funding, the General Assembly’s Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee endorsed a less costly $150-per-child credit starting with 2025 earnings and tax returns filed in the spring of 2026, with a maximum household benefit of $450.
It would be available to single parents earning up to $100,000 per year and couples earning up to $200,000, starting with 2026 earnings.
The credit would be gradually phased out above those income levels. For every $1,000 earned above those thresholds, households would lose 10% of the credit’s value.
The credit also would be refundable. Even if a household earns so little it has no state tax liability to reduce via the credit, it still would have $150 per child added to its refund.
Nonpartisan analysts project this tax break would cost government about $83 million per year, about the same as Lamont’s plan to expand the property tax credit. It’s also roughly one-quarter of what legislators anticipate the state would lose with a full $600-per-child benefit.
And while the finance committee measure wouldn’t order increases in the credit in future years, many supporters say proposals to increase the credit would enjoy strong backing down the road.
Rep. Jillian Gilchest, D-West Hartford, co-chairwoman of the Human Services Committee and another backer of the $600-per-child benefit, predicted most Democrats won’t be satisfied for long with “an austere child tax credit” given likely federal cutbacks in health and human service programs. 
“More people are going to feel the pain of these [federal] budget decisions,” she said.
Reformers have been clamoring for a child credit in recent years as public and private analyses show Connecticut’s state and municipal tax systems, combined, disproportionately burden the poor and middle class.
The Department of Revenue Services’ 2024 report found the lowest-earning 10% of households effectively spent almost 40% of their income in 2020 to cover state or municipal tax burdens, more than five times the rate faced by Connecticut’s highest earners and two-and-a-half times the statewide average.
Even one of the largest state tax cuts in 2023, which included the first income tax rate reduction since the mid-1990s, only slowed — but didn’t reverse — the ever-widening shift onto working families, according to a 2024 analysis from Connecticut Voices for Children, a progressive New Haven-based policy group.
The United Way of Connecticut, one of the progressive groups spearheading this year’s push for a child tax credit, released a report last October showing that a family of four — two parents and two children — needed to earn $113,520 in 2022 in this state to cover a basic “survival budget.”
The United Way’s methodology covers housing, food, utilities, transportation, child care and — assuming the family can’t afford a computer — at least one smart phone. By comparison, the Federal Poverty Level, a simple metric developed in the mid-1960s by U.S. Social Security Administration economists and based largely on the cost of a minimum food diet, said a family of four earning more than $27,750 in 2022 was above the poverty line.
“On a good day, 42% of Connecticut families with children struggle to make ends meet,” said Lisa Tepper Bates, president of the United Way’s Connecticut chapter. “The proposed cuts to Medicaid and SNAP will hit many Connecticut families hard. And ongoing economic upheaval and rising prices affect every family in our state. Creating a Connecticut child tax credit has never been more important.”
CT has underestimated tax revenues by wide margins
Legislators also were optimistic that Connecticut could afford to provide a child tax credit, even given the uncertainty of federal funding, given its budget caps and its track record of projecting revenues since Lamont took office in 2019.
These caps have generated surpluses averaging $1.8 billion, an amount equal to 8% of the General Fund, since they last were set in 2017. The administration is projecting a $2.4 billion surplus this year, equal to 10%. Analysts project budget caps will capture at least about $1.3 billion in each of the next two fiscal years.
Connecticut has funneled $12.5 billion in surpluses since 2017 to build reserves and scale back pension debt, a furious pace that far outstrips any similar effort in modern history. 
Critics say the state has overcompensated for fiscal mistakes of prior decades and is saving excessively now at the expense of core programs and tax relief for the poor and middle class.
The state also has been extremely conservative in its revenue projections in recent years.
Legislators largely build the budget each year using an April 30 forecast prepared by their nonpartisan Office of Fiscal Analysis and by the governor’s budget staff. The basis for that forecast is income and other tax data provided by the administration, particularly the Department of Revenue Services.
Connecticut has amassed large surpluses in each of Lamont’s six years in office. Most of those surpluses turned out to be significantly larger than projected on April 30. The state’s fiscal year ends June 30, and the comptroller formally closes the books in late September.
Since Lamont has been governor, the actual surplus has topped the April 30 projection by an average of $600 million per year.
But 2020 and 2021 were outliers. The coronavirus led officials to push the 2020 income tax filing deadline back from Apil 15 to July 15. And in 2021 they moved it to May 15. In both cases, that meant analysts had limited data to build their projections.
But even if those two fiscal years are removed, the average increase in surplus after the April 30 projection has been $375 million.
“I believe it’s realistic to continue to talk about a phase-in” of a larger child tax credit, Looney said, noting that the average surplus in recent years far exceeds the cost of helping working families.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Nunez-Speech-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-26 06:03:45.695262

Today is Memorial Day – the day on which we honor the memory of the servicemen and women who made the ultimate sacrifice for our nation.
All caring and thinking people should take at least a moment today to lift up these heroes.
And today would also be a good one to help assure that the government supports the heroes who are still with us.
And sadly, the need here is great.
As recent news reports have recounted in painful detail, Trump administration budget cuts are decimating the already understaffed and underfunded Veterans Administration and VA hospitals. More than 80,000 employees are being fired and that’s sure to wreak havoc with the services upon which millions of military veterans depend.
At a Voices for Veterans event in Fayetteville last week, several vets blasted the cuts as cruel, shortsighted, and sure to cause enormous pain and suffering.
The bottom line: Memorial Day is about remembering those we’ve lost – that’s for sure – but we also honor their sacrifice by doing everything in our power to spare living veterans from an early grave.

CAVE CITY, Ark. — When a severe tornado tore through Cave City, Arkansas, in March, retiree Debra Lindsey was in her trailer home with her husband.
“I didn’t even know there was a tornado on the ground until the sirens went off, and then in 45 seconds it was here,” Lindsey said. “It was very scary. If it would’ve been 100 to 150 feet closer to here, it would’ve taken the front of our trailer off.”
Even without a direct hit, she estimated that the damage to their home and property was between $30,000 and $40,000. Their storage buildings were destroyed, along with their two vehicles. And the insurance company won’t cover everything.
Across the street, Robert and Kymberlie Watson rode out the tornadoes with their seven children in the nearest storm shelter. When they returned, they found roughly $60,000 worth of damage to their property.
About one month after the tornadoes, the Trump administration denied Arkansas’ request for a major disaster declaration. The declaration would have brought federal funds into the state to help with recovery. Both families thought they’d have to pay out-of-pocket for repairs.
The power to grant a disaster declaration and access to the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s assistance programs lies solely in the hands of the president, and President Donald Trump’s administration is looking to significantly scale back FEMA and pass disaster recovery costs onto states.
Lindsey, a disabled retired nurse, feared that the lack of federal assistance for their home repairs would force her back into the workforce.

Another round of severe weather walloped the Lower Mississippi River Basin in early April, causing extensive flooding and more tornado damage in parts of Arkansas, Tennessee, Kentucky and Mississippi.
Then, some good news: The Trump administration reversed course on May 13 after an appeal and a personal plea from Arkansas Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders. The president granted a major disaster declaration, allowing individuals like Lindsey and the Watsons to apply for aid.
“If we get some help out of it, that’s absolutely amazing. We could really use it,” Kymberlie Watson said. “We’re surprised, a little bit … because the government actually stepped up and helped its citizens.”
Cave City may not be so lucky. Trump has yet to approve recovery assistance to public entities, which may leave local governments — including the town of less than 2,000 residents — with big bills. On May 3, Sanders submitted another disaster declaration application asking for extensive public assistance. Requests for FEMA aid from Mississippi, Missouri and Tennessee also remain outstanding, though the Trump administration did grant Kentucky’s request.
“President Trump and his administration will continue working to further empower state and local governments to build their own resilience before disaster strikes and to execute rapid, smart response when supplemental federal assistance is required to truly protect citizens and aid a return to normalcy,” a White House official wrote the Desk by email.
Cave City pushes forward
Cave City Mayor Jonas Anderson was at a ribbon-cutting event for the city’s ambulance service when he learned of the initial rejection from the Trump administration. His first thought?
“You have got to be kidding me,” he said.

Anderson estimated that some 50 Cave City homes were damaged in the March tornado, and 25 of those were completely destroyed. He said underinsurance was likely a huge issue in the community, and the costs for the city to remove all the debris might run over $300,000 for a municipality that only has an annual budget of around $1.4 million. Cave City also lost its only grocery store, forcing residents to drive 20 to 30 minutes to nearby towns for necessities.
A disaster declaration opens up potential programs for state and local governments to recoup some money spent on removing debris and repairing infrastructure. It can also unlock assistance programs for individuals, including post-disaster support services and financial aid for people who are uninsured or underinsured. Not all programs are offered for every disaster.
After a disaster, government personnel assess the cost of damage. Sanders’ requests for federal disaster aid for dozens of counties mostly in the Arkansas Delta estimated public damages at over $21 million from both the March and April storms, including more than $3 million in Sharp County, home to part of Cave City.
FEMA uses cost per capita to gauge whether local and state governments can handle recovery themselves, or if they’ll need federal help. Those thresholds currently stand at $4.72 per capita for counties and $1.89 per capita for states. Per capita damages for Sharp County, where Cave City is located, are estimated at $179.
But meeting those thresholds does not guarantee that the president will approve a disaster declaration. A president is not required to justify their decision, and documentation of the reasons for denial is considered privileged — not public record.
Sanders released a statement thanking the Trump administration for finally delivering individual assistance, but did not mention her second, outstanding request for public assistance and additional funds. She also expressed support for Trump’s efforts to reform FEMA.
“Our entire state is grateful for President Trump’s leadership and assistance as we recover from the devastating storms that struck Arkansas earlier this spring,” Sanders said. “I had a productive conversation with the President in which he expressed his support for our state and I offered my full endorsement of his plans to reform FEMA to save money and provide greater direct assistance to disaster victims.”

Over the past two years, the Biden administration provided more than $101 million in public disaster recovery funding to Arkansas, according to FEMA data. And before that, the first Trump administration gave Arkansas more than $101 million in federal disaster recovery assistance between 2017 and 2020.
States in the Lower Mississippi River Basin have received more than $31.3 billion in federal public recovery assistance following natural disasters since 1998, according to FEMA data. Hurricane response has consistently required the most federal assistance.
In recent years, there have been more requests for disaster declarations and more of them have been approved than denied. Between 1953 and 1999, Lower Mississippi River Basin states saw two approvals for every one denial. Within the last 25 years, the approval ratio rose to 5-1.
John Gasper, an associate professor of economics at Carnegie Mellon University’s Tepper School of Business, found in a 2015 analysis of county-level FEMA data from 1992 through 2005 that the chance of a denial is lower when the president and governor belong to the same political party. In “non-election years or non-opportune times,” denials typically follow FEMA’s unofficial guidelines, he said in a May interview.
Trump denies disaster aid, tells states to do more

There are two reasons for FEMA aid’s president-centric policy design, Gasper said: The federal government wants the ability to grant aid in “marginal cases that don’t make the threshold but still are clear disasters,” and politicians realize the benefits of giving aid to constituents.
“In an election year, it’s a great opportunity for a campaigning official to come in, do photo-ops, roll up their sleeves, etcetera,” he said. “In non-election years, they have less concern there, so the probability of denial goes up substantially.”
The denial of Arkansas’ initial request for help was “shocking,” said Anderson. Sanders, who worked as press secretary for Trump for part of his first term, credited her access to the president for her appeal’s eventual success.
Changes at FEMA have further muddied the process of requesting and obtaining disaster assistance. Since January, the Trump administration has dismissed hundreds of FEMA employees and scrapped an agency program funding disaster prevention efforts in states and municipalities. The Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program had made $5 billion in grant money available since 2020, awarding over $12 million to Arkansas, Mississippi and Tennessee through 2023.
Federal officials have also discussed making it harder to secure funds after a disaster. In an internal memo obtained by CNN, former acting FEMA Administrator Cameron Hamilton proposed various reforms to curb the agency’s disaster spending, including quadrupling the financial burden states must sustain to qualify for public aid. Hamilton was fired weeks later, and state officials say they have received no word regarding changes to FEMA’s public assistance threshold.
While the higher benchmark proposed by Hamilton has not been adopted publicly, the low number of disaster declarations approved so far this year suggests the White House is following new standards for public aid eligibility, one emergency management expert explained.
“We don’t have to wait for an official guidance on this. We know that the bar has shifted,” said Bryan Koon, who led Florida’s Division of Emergency Management from 2011 to 2017 and is CEO of IEM, a disaster management consulting firm. “What got you a declaration in 2024 and earlier is not going to get you a disaster declaration in 2025.”
Hamilton’s replacement at FEMA, David Richardson, reportedly held a meeting with staff where he said a large part of the response and recovery would be put on states under his leadership, according to Drop Site News.
20 state AGs sue feds for tying transportation and disaster funding to immigration enforcement

Bipartisan support for disaster aid reform does exist, but Trump’s FEMA overhaul has sparked concern among state emergency management officials, who say they aren’t prepared to take over disaster funding responsibilities from the agency.
Such a transition would require extensive guidance from the administration and planning from state and local governments, said Lynn Budd, president of the National Emergency Management Association and director of Wyoming’s Office of Homeland Security. Reducing FEMA assistance with little clarity or advance notice risks leaving communities unprepared for disasters moving forward, she added.
Even with clearer messaging from the administration, scaling back FEMA support would require states to make tough choices on how to cover disaster costs and budget for future emergencies, Koon explained. Reallocating funds toward disaster management would mean cuts to other services, and states would have to lean heavily on volunteer organizations to fill financial and staffing gaps.
“States are going to have to adapt,” Koon said. “It’s going to be a lot more of a patchwork of support to make up for what would have come from the federal government.”
Koon emphasized that shifting disaster expenses to states would also mean higher costs for residents. Households will have to purchase broader insurance coverage in the absence of FEMA assistance, he explained, and families will have to pay for damage previously covered by the agency.
In Mississippi, where residents are still recovering from the same storms and tornadoes that struck Arkansas in mid-March, emergency management officials said they will continue looking to FEMA for disaster assistance until they are instructed otherwise. The state is awaiting a decision from the White House on its own disaster declaration request, and officials said they won’t adjust operations or request additional funding from the legislature without more guidance from the administration.
“We have received no indication from FEMA about any proposed changes to formulas that determine federal disaster assistance,” said Scott Simmons, director of external affairs at the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency. “Until the rules of the game change, we’re going to continue playing by the rules.”
Others are looking ahead at how states could respond if FEMA steps back.
States already play active roles in recovery but they “need to become a little bit more proficient and get help in coordinating and answering disasters together,” Colin Wellenkamp, executive director of the Mississippi River Cities and Towns Initiative, a coalition of more than 100 mayors of river basin cities, said in early April following severe flooding along the river.

Flooding on the Mississippi River typically impacts all of its 10 bordering states, he said, so if states do take on more responsibility, they would need to work “in tandem” to coordinate recovery efforts.
“That isn’t necessarily something that happens through the FEMA process,” Wellenkamp said.
A new round of storms and tornadoes swept through the basin in mid-May, leaving major damage in St. Louis. And hurricane season begins June 1. Researchers are predicting above average activity this year.
With the Trump administration’s new approach to FEMA aid, Anderson worries that recovery for small places like Cave City may become even harder.
“There’s just things the Federal government has been or should be doing … they’re just a lot more equipped to handle that than a city or a state,”Anderson said. It’s an imperfect process and he added that “numbers on a spreadsheet don’t always tell the human story.”

More than 80 years after he died in the attack on Pearl Harbor, John Connolly was finally laid to rest – not as an unknown in a mass grave, but as a naval officer in Arlington National Cemetery. 
When the Navy first called to tell his daughter, Virginia Harbison, that her father’s remains had been identified, she hung up. At 91, living in assisted care in Texas, she could hardly believe it. It was her son, Bill Ingram, who called her back to share the news again. She was silent for so long that he had to ask if she was all right. “Bill,” she said, “I hadn’t thought about that for 60 years.”

She has lived the full life her father never had the chance to. In March, Ingram pushed his mother in her wheelchair to her father’s gravesite for the burial. 
“They fold the flag in this very tight, nice triangle, and then with white gloves, the commanding officer comes and takes it and kneels down and hands it to my mother,” said Ingram, who lives in San Francisco. “It was incredible.”
On Dec. 7, 1941 during the attack on Pearl Harbor, 429 service members aboard the USS Oklahoma died. Horrifyingly, men trapped below deck after the ship capsized could be heard tapping out “SOS” in Morse code as the air supply dwindled. Though 32 men were rescued, the rest were tragically not reached in time. 
After the war ended, the remains were recovered and buried in the National Cemetery of the Pacific in Hawaii, too water damaged and commingled to be identified individually. There they remained for years until modern science caught up with historical tragedy. 
The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency disinterred the USS Oklahoma remains in 2015 to send to a DNA laboratory. Carrie LeGarde, a forensic archaeologist with the agency and project lead for the Oklahoma Project, said her team started the process by testing small pieces of bone for maternal line DNA. Overall, they inventoried 13,000 bones and took 4,900 DNA samples. For Connolly, identification was complicated. 
“We had several sequences that had multiple individuals, and that was actually the case with John Connolly, and part of why his identification occurred later in the project,” she said.

Since John Connolly was older than most of the men aboard the USS Oklahoma as one of the few officers on the ship and scheduled to retire just three weeks after the bombing, the team at DPAA relied on dental evidence in addition to DNA testing to confirm his identity. 
Connolly was born in Savannah in 1893 and joined the Navy in 1912. He served during World War I and was eventually promoted to a chief warrant officer. In 1941, his wife, Mary Connolly, and their two daughters, eight-year-old Virginia and six-year-old Helen were eagerly awaiting his return and retirement in Long Beach, California, when the Navy informed them he had died. 
Mary Connolly never remarried. 
“She was very sad all her life because she married at age 30 or 31 and her husband was away in the service, but was killed right before he was supposed to retire,” Ingram said. 
Connolly’s memory has been passed down through the generations.
“We’ve taken my family to Hawaii, and we went to the memorial and found the marker for his name,” Ingram said.

Everything changed last year when Ingram got a call from the Navy. In a 200-page report, the Navy detailed the historical background, identification process, and scientific evidence.
“With the research that was involved, both with historical research and medical research, there’s a lot of folks at DPAA that are involved,” Navy POW/MIA branch head Richard Jenkins said. “We as a service will explain that to the family, with the hopes of them feeling comfortable with the findings and showing them that it’s not just any set of remains, it’s actually going to be that person.”
There’s a story that runs in Ingram’s family about his grandfather. A couple of years after World War II, a young man knocked on the family home and introduced himself to Virginia and Mary Connolly. He had been on the USS Oklahoma with John Connolly, he said, and when the ship was hit, Connolly pushed open a hatch and forced him out. Connolly had saved his life. 
In 1944, the Navy re-commissioned one of their ships as the USS John Connolly. Though his story was a tragic one — an officer who never returned home whose remains were left unknown — history has granted him a second chance at closure. Over eight decades later, he got the hero’s burial he deserved. 
“They did everything. They had a band. They played Taps. They fired the guns,” Ingram said. “Seven soldiers fired three times for a 21-gun salute.” 
A final sendoff at last.

In the years following the bitter Civil War, a former Union general took a holiday originated by former Confederates and helped spread it across the entire country.
The holiday was Memorial Day, an annual commemoration was born in the former Confederate States in 1866 and adopted by the United States in 1868. It is a holiday in which the nation honors its military dead.
Gen. John A. Logan, who headed the largest Union veterans’ fraternity at that time, the Grand Army of the Republic, is usually credited as being the originator of the holiday.
Yet when General Logan established the holiday, he acknowledged its genesis among the Union’s former enemies, saying, “It was not too late for the Union men of the nation to follow the example of the people of the South.”
I’m a scholar who has written – with co-author Daniel Bellware – a history of Memorial Day. Cities and towns across America have for more than a century claimed to be the holiday’s birthplace, but we have sifted through the myths and half-truths and uncovered the authentic story of how this holiday came into being.
 Generous acts bore fruit

During 1866, the first year of this annual observance in the South, a feature of the holiday emerged that made awareness, admiration and eventually imitation of it spread quickly to the North.
During the inaugural Memorial Day observances which were conceived in Columbus, Georgia, many Southern participants – especially women – decorated graves of Confederate soldiers as well as, unexpectedly, those of their former enemies who fought for the Union.

Shortly after those first Memorial Day observances all across the South, newspaper coverage in the North was highly favorable to the ex-Confederates.
“The action of the ladies on this occasion, in burying whatever animosities or ill-feeling may have been engendered in the late war towards those who fought against them, is worthy of all praise and commendation,” wrote one paper.
On May 9, 1866, the Cleveland Daily Leader lauded the Southern women during their first Memorial Day.
“The act was as beautiful as it was unselfish, and will be appreciated in the North.”
The New York Commercial Advertiser, recognizing the magnanimous deeds of the women of Columbus, Georgia, echoed the sentiment. “Let this incident, touching and beautiful as it is, impart to our Washington authorities a lesson in conciliation.”
 Power of a poem

To be sure, this sentiment was not unanimous. There were many in both parts of the U.S. who had no interest in conciliation.
But as a result of one of these news reports, Francis Miles Finch, a Northern judge, academic and poet, wrote a poem titled “The Blue and the Gray.” Finch’s poem quickly became part of the American literary canon. He explained what inspired him to write it:
“It struck me that the South was holding out a friendly hand, and that it was our duty, not only as conquerors, but as men and their fellow citizens of the nation, to grasp it.”
Finch’s poem seemed to extend a full pardon to the South: “They banish our anger forever when they laurel the graves of our dead” was one of the lines.

  Not just poems: Sheet music written to commemorate Memorial Day in 1870. Library of Congress
Almost immediately, the poem circulated across America in books, magazines and newspapers. By the end of the 19th century, school children everywhere were required to memorize Finch’s poem. The ubiquitous publication of Finch’s rhyme meant that by the end of 1867, the southern Memorial Day holiday was a familiar phenomenon throughout the entire, and recently reunited, country.
General Logan was aware of the forgiving sentiments of people like Finch. When Logan’s order establishing Memorial Day was published in various newspapers in May 1868, Finch’s poem was sometimes appended to the order.
 ‘The blue and the grey’

It was not long before Northerners decided that they would not only adopt the Southern custom of Memorial Day, but also the Southern custom of “burying the hatchet.” A group of Union veterans explained their intentions in a letter to the Philadelphia Evening Telegraph on May 28, 1869:
“Wishing to bury forever the harsh feelings engendered by the war, Post 19 has decided not to pass by the graves of the Confederates sleeping in our lines, but divide each year between the blue and the grey the first floral offerings of a common country. We have no powerless foes. Post 19 thinks of the Southern dead only as brave men.”
Other reports of reciprocal magnanimity circulated in the North, including the gesture of a 10-year-old who made a wreath of flowers and sent it to the overseer of the holiday, Colonel Leaming, in Lafayette, Indiana, with the following note attached, published in The New Hampshire Patriot on July 15, 1868:
“Will you please put this wreath upon some rebel soldier’s grave? My dear papa is buried at Andersonville, (Georgia) and perhaps some little girl will be kind enough to put a few flowers upon his grave.”
President Abraham Lincoln’s wish that there be “malice toward none” and “charity for all” was visible in the magnanimous actions of participants on both sides, who extended an olive branch during the Memorial Day observances in those first three years.
Although not known by many today, the early evolution of the Memorial Day holiday was a manifestation of Lincoln’s hope for reconciliation between North and South.

Like many moderate-income workers, public school teachers Julia and Scott Whitnall didn’t think they’d become homeowners in their early 30s. Especially in California.
“We never felt homeownership was in our cards. But we did it!” Julia Whitnall said. “We’re extremely happy.”
The couple moved May 16 to a $509,000 two-bedroom house in Ripon, east of San Francisco in the Central Valley region.
It wasn’t easy. Despite a relatively high combined income of $140,000 from their nearby jobs, they had to compromise on size and take on extra work at summer camps to pull it off. Then they had to exercise patience as the sellers struggled to find a new home.
High interest rates and high prices in a still-competitive housing market continue to make it tough for first-time buyers, even those with good but moderate incomes.

On a national level, households making $75,000 to $100,000 — typical of teachers, nurses and skilled trades workers in many states — face a daunting lack of homes they can afford. That’s according to new research by the National Association of Realtors and Realtor.com based on listings in March of this year compared with 2024. However, the numbers showed an encouraging 20% increase in homes for sale, affordable or not.
Despite more houses for sale, those moderate-income buyers — which the report called “middle- and upper-middle-income buyers” — are much more hard-pressed to find an affordable home than they were in 2019, when almost half the homes on the market were affordable to them. This year they can afford only 21.2% of homes on the market — a slight improvement compared with 20.8% in 2024, according to the report.
It also found that a few states are improving in affordability for people in the $75,000-to-$100,000 income range. But many states are not.
The largest affordability gaps are in California, Hawaii, Idaho, Massachusetts and Montana, where such households can afford fewer than 12% of houses on the market. By contrast, they could afford about half the houses for sale in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Ohio and West Virginia.
There’s progress in states that are adding more housing at moderate price points: Arizona, Colorado, Delaware, Florida and Utah, according to the Realtors report.


 Balanced markets

Nationwide, to get home markets back in line with moderate-income families, the United States needs 416,000 more homes for sale at or below $255,000, according to the report.
“In many places, we’re still seeing a huge mismatch between income levels and what’s available to buy for moderate-income families,” said Nadia Evangelou, the National Association of Realtors’ senior economist and director of real estate research.
“We are no longer in crisis mode, but we are still very far from where we need to be. We can’t fix it overnight. It will take years,” Evangelou said.

Heather, who asked not to share her last name for privacy reasons, said she can’t even think of buying a house near her job on Long Island, New York. She makes more than $100,000 as a registered nurse and her family makes $170,000 with her husband’s job in building maintenance. But $4,400 in rent and $2,000 in monthly day care costs for three children have them living paycheck to paycheck.
“We can’t even afford a small car repair, let alone a mortgage in our hometown” of Ronkonkoma in Suffolk County, Heather said. Their jobs exposed her and her husband to risks in the pandemic that her neighbors avoided with remote work, she said. But she now feels like she’s in worse shape financially than she was in 2019 and considers moving away.
“All of our hard work feels like it was for nothing,” Heather said. “It’s disheartening that we can’t afford to live where we grew up, but that’s the reality we are facing.”
Some states can still be a refuge of affordability.
Ashley and Tristan Jonas bought a $252,000 house in northwest Ohio after three years of getting shut out by higher or all-cash offers. Ashley Jonas, 32, trained as a teacher but now works in skilled trades as a project coordinator for a countertop company, and the couple makes about $140,000 with Tristan Jonas’ job as a computer programmer.
“We happened to hit the market at the right time in 2025,” Ashley Jonas said. “We bid on this house just as [President Donald] Trump was announcing tariffs. I think a lot of people were holding their coin purses. We weren’t.”
 Help for teachers

Teachers, who generally make less than nurses or trades workers, are particularly squeezed. Some states, facing teacher shortages in local schools, are working to raise pay. And increasingly, some schools and hospitals are providing housing to lure more teachers and nurses.
“We lose so many teachers because they can’t find housing here,” said Autumn Rivera, a 20-year teaching veteran and 2022 Colorado Teacher of the Year. Despite her experience and credentials, Rivera said she can’t contemplate buying even a townhouse in the rural resort town of Glenwood Springs, where she teaches.

Prices for those townhouses now start in the $700,000 range, more than twice what they were when she last considered buying in 2019. Rivera feels lucky to have a reasonable rent by sharing a home with its owner, but many teachers in her Roaring Fork Schools need the 117 apartments provided by the district with affordable rent, she said. The district hopes the apartments will allow teachers to save up for a home; it has also built 14 houses for staff with Habitat for Humanity and Holy Cross Energy.
One way to make homebuying more feasible for teachers is to pay them more — a strategy that paid off for New Mexico, one of the few bright spots in a different report on teachers’ inability to afford housing, which was published this month by the National Council on Teacher Quality, a research and advocacy group.
Beginning teachers in Albuquerque saw a 60% increase in pay between 2019 and 2025, which fell just short of a 65% jump in home prices, according to the report. The report credited a state law that raised teacher salaries, including starting pay, by $10,000.
“We’re dealing with the issue of teachers being able to live in the communities where they’re actually working,” said state Rep. Joy Garratt, a Democrat who sponsored a new law, signed in April, that sets higher minimum salaries for teachers effective July 1.
Detroit schools also gave teachers with advanced degrees a pay boost of up to 50% since 2019, about the same increase as home prices, according to the report from the National Council on Teacher Quality. Albuquerque and Detroit are on the report’s list of most affordable places for beginning teachers to live.
But nationally, on average, experienced teachers who started in 2019 are less able to afford a home now than when they began, according to the report.
“Teacher pay has gone up 24% in the last five years, which some might say is solid growth, and yet the increase in house for purchase has gone up 47%,” said Heather Peske, the organization’s president.
“Housing prices are critical to being able to attract and keep great teachers,” Peske said. “People will be leaving the profession trying to find something that pays enough for housing. And bottom line, kids won’t get as good an education.”

Puskar/The Associated Press)In submitting her updated budget proposal in March, Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs lamented the rising costs of the state’s school vouchers program that directs public dollars to pay private school tuition.
Characterizing vouchers as an “entitlement program,” Hobbs said the state could spend more than $1 billion subsidizing private education in the upcoming fiscal year. The Democratic governor said those expenses could crowd out other budget priorities, including disability programs and pay raises for firefighters and state troopers.
It’s a dilemma that some budget experts fear will become more common nationwide as the costs of school choice measures mount across the states, reaching billions of dollars each year.
“School vouchers are increasingly eating up state budgets in a way that I don’t think is sustainable long term,” said Whitney Tucker, director of state fiscal policy research at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a think tank that advocates for left-leaning tax policies.
House and Senate pass bills to remove income limits on EFA program

Vouchers and scholarship programs, which use taxpayer money to cover private school tuition, are part of the wider school choice movement that also includes charter schools and other alternatives to public schools.
Opponents have long warned about vouchers draining resources from public education as students move from public schools to private ones. But research into several programs has shown many voucher recipients already were enrolled in private schools. That means universal vouchers could drive up costs by creating two parallel education systems — both funded by taxpayers.
In Arizona, state officials reported most private school students receiving vouchers in the first two years of the expanded program were not previously enrolled in public schools. In fiscal year 2024, more than half the state’s 75,000 voucher recipients were previously enrolled in private schools or were being homeschooled.
“Vouchers don’t shift costs — they add costs,” Joshua Cowen, a professor of education policy at Michigan State University who studies the issue, recently told Stateline. “Most voucher recipients were already in private schools, meaning states are paying for education they previously didn’t have to fund.”
Voucher proponents, though, say those figures can be misleading. Arizona, like other states with recent expansions, previously had more modest voucher programs. So some kids who were already enrolled in private schools could have already been receiving state subsidies.
In addition to increasing competition, supporters say the programs can actually save taxpayer dollars by delivering education at a lower overall cost than traditional public schools.
One thing is certain: With a record number of students receiving subsidies to attend private schools, vouchers are quickly creating budget concerns for some state leaders.
The rising costs of school choice measures come after years of deep cuts to income taxes in many states, leaving them with less money to spend. An end of pandemic-era aid and potential looming cuts to federal support also have created widespread uncertainty about state budgets.
“We’re seeing a number of things that are creating a sort of perfect storm from a fiscal perspective in the states,” said Tucker, of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
Last year, Arizona leaders waded through an estimated $1.3 billion budget shortfall. Budget experts said the voucher program was responsible for hundreds of millions of that deficit.
A new universal voucher program in Texas is expected to cost $1 billion over its next two-year budget cycle — a figure that could balloon to nearly $5 billion by 2030, according to a legislative fiscal note.
Earlier this year, Wyoming Republican Gov. Mark Gordon signed a bill expanding the state’s voucher program. But last week, he acknowledged his own “substantial concerns” about the state’s ability to fund vouchers and its public education obligations under the constitution.
“I think the legislature’s got a very tall task to understand how they’re going to be able to fund all of these things,” he said in an interview with WyoFile.
Voucher proponents, who have been active at the state level for years, are gaining new momentum with support from President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans.
In January, Trump ordered federal agencies to allow states, tribes, and military families to access federal money for private K-12 education through education savings accounts, voucher programs or tax credits.
Earlier this month, Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee voted in favor of making $20 billion available over the next four years for a federal school voucher program as part of broader work on a bill to extend Trump’s 2017 tax cuts.
Martin Lueken, the director of the Fiscal Research and Education Center at EdChoice, a nonprofit that advocates for school choice measures, argues school choice measures can actually deliver savings to taxpayers.
Lueken said vouchers are not to blame for state budget woes. He said public school systems for years have increased spending faster than inflation. And he noted that school choice measures make up a small share of overall state spending — nationally about 0.3% of total state expenditures in states with school choice, he said.
“Public schooling remains one of the largest line items in state budgets,” he said in an interview. “They are still the dominant provider of K-12 education, and certainly looking at the education pie, they still receive the lion’s share.
“It’s not a choice problem. I would say that it’s a problem with the status quo and the public school system,” he said.
Washington, D.C., and 35 states offer some school choice programs, according to EdChoice. That includes 18 states with voucher programs so expansive that virtually all students can participate regardless of income.
But Lueken said framing vouchers as a new entitlement program is misleading. That’s because all students, even the wealthiest, have always been entitled to a public education — whether they’ve chosen to attend free public schools or private ones that charge tuition.
“At the end of the day, the thing that matters most above dollars are students and families,” he said. “Research is clear that competition works. Public schools have responded in very positive ways when they are faced with increased competitive pressure from choice programs.”
Public school advocates say funding both private and public schools is untenable.
In Wisconsin, Republican lawmakers are considering a major voucher expansion that would alter the funding structure for vouchers, potentially putting more strain on the state’s general fund.
The state spent about $629 million on its four voucher programs during the 2024-2025 school year, according to the Wisconsin Association of School Business Officials, which represents employees in school district finance, human resources and leadership.
The association warns proposed legislation could exacerbate problems with the “unaffordable parallel school systems” in place now by shifting more private schooling costs from parents of those students to state taxpayers at large.
Such expansion “could create the conditions for even greater funding challenges for Wisconsin’s traditional public schools and the state budget as a whole,” the association’s research director wrote in a paper on the issue.
In Arizona, Hobbs originally sought to eliminate the universal voucher program — a nonstarter in the Republican-controlled legislature. She has since proposed shrinking the program by placing income limits that would disqualify the state’s wealthiest families.
That idea also faced Republican opposition.
Legislators are now pushing to enshrine access to vouchers in the state constitution.
Marisol Garcia, president of the Arizona Education Association, the state’s 20,000-member teachers union, noted that vouchers and public education funds are both sourced from the general fund.
“So it almost immediately started to impact public services,” she said of the universal voucher program.
While the union says vouchers have led to cutbacks of important resources such as counselors in public schools, Garcia said the sweeping program also affects the state’s ability to fund other services like housing, transportation and health care.
“Every budget cycle becomes where can we cut in order to essentially feed this out-of-control program?” she said.

Credit: Tracey AttleeMore than 80 years after he died in the attack on Pearl Harbor, John Connolly was finally laid to rest – not as an unknown in a mass grave, but as a naval officer in Arlington National Cemetery.
When the Navy first called to tell his daughter, Virginia Harbison, that her father’s remains had been identified, she hung up. At 91, living in assisted care in Texas, she could hardly believe it. It was her son, Bill Ingram, who called her back to share the news again. She was silent for so long that he had to ask if she was all right. “Bill,” she said, “I hadn’t thought about that for 60 years.”
She has lived the full life her father never had the chance to. In March, Ingram pushed his mother in her wheelchair to her father’s gravesite for the burial.
“They fold the flag in this very tight, nice triangle, and then with white gloves, the commanding officer comes and takes it and kneels down and hands it to my mother,” said Ingram, who lives in San Francisco. “It was incredible.”
On Dec. 7, 1941 during the attack on Pearl Harbor, 429 service members aboard the USS Oklahoma died. Horrifyingly, men trapped below deck after the ship capsized could be heard tapping out “SOS” in Morse code as the air supply dwindled. Though 32 men were rescued, the rest were tragically not reached in time.
After the war ended, the remains were recovered and buried in the National Cemetery of the Pacific in Hawaii, too water damaged and commingled to be identified individually. There they remained for years until modern science caught up with historical tragedy.
The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency disinterred the USS Oklahoma remains in 2015 to send to a DNA laboratory. Carrie LeGarde, a forensic archaeologist with the agency and project lead for the Oklahoma Project, said her team started the process by testing small pieces of bone for maternal line DNA. Overall, they inventoried 13,000 bones and took 4,900 DNA samples. For Connolly, identification was complicated.
“We had several sequences that had multiple individuals, and that was actually the case with John Connolly, and part of why his identification occurred later in the project,” she said.

Since John Connolly was older than most of the men aboard the USS Oklahoma as one of the few officers on the ship and scheduled to retire just three weeks after the bombing, the team at DPAA relied on dental evidence in addition to DNA testing to confirm his identity.
Connolly was born in Savannah in 1893 and joined the Navy in 1912. He served during World War I and was eventually promoted to a chief warrant officer. In 1941, his wife, Mary Connolly, and their two daughters, eight-year-old Virginia and six-year-old Helen were eagerly awaiting his return and retirement in Long Beach, California, when the Navy informed them he had died.
Mary Connolly never remarried.
“She was very sad all her life because she married at age 30 or 31 and her husband was away in the service, but was killed right before he was supposed to retire,” Ingram said.
Connolly’s memory has been passed down through the generations.
“We’ve taken my family to Hawaii, and we went to the memorial and found the marker for his name,” Ingram said.
Everything changed last year when Ingram got a call from the Navy. In a 200-page report, the Navy detailed the historical background, identification process and scientific evidence.

“With the research that was involved, both with historical research and medical research, there’s a lot of folks at DPAA that are involved,” Navy POW/MIA branch head Richard Jenkins said. “We as a service will explain that to the family, with the hopes of them feeling comfortable with the findings and showing them that it’s not just any set of remains, it’s actually going to be that person.”
There’s a story that runs in Ingram’s family about his grandfather. A couple of years after World War II, a young man knocked on the family home and introduced himself to Virginia and Mary Connolly. He had been on the USS Oklahoma with John Connolly, he said, and when the ship was hit, Connolly pushed open a hatch and forced him out. Connolly had saved his life.
In 1944, the Navy re-commissioned one of their ships as the USS John Connolly. Though his story was a tragic one – an officer who never returned home whose remains were left unknown – history has granted him a second chance at closure. Over eight decades later, he got the hero’s burial he deserved.
“They did everything. They had a band. They played Taps. They fired the guns,” Ingram said. “Seven soldiers fired three times for a 21-gun salute.”
A final sendoff at last.

(JackF/iStock via Getty Images Plus)Republican lawmakers have been battling over a bill that includes massive tax and spending cuts. Much of their disagreement has been over provisions intended to reduce the cost of Medicaid.
The popular health insurance program, which is funded by both the federal and state governments, covers about 78.5 million low-income and disabled people — more than 1 in 5 Americans.
On May 22, 2025, the House of Representatives narrowly approved the tax, spending and immigration bill. The legislation, which passed without any support from Democrats, is designed to reduce federal Medicaid spending by requiring anyone enrolled in the program who appears to be able to get a job to either satisfy work requirements or lose their coverage. It’s still unclear, however, whether Senate Republicans would support that provision.
Although there are few precedents for such a mandate for Medicaid, other safety net programs have been enforcing similar rules for nearly three decades. I’m a political scientist who has extensively studied the work requirements of another safety net program: Temporary Assistance for Needy Families.
As I explain in my book, “Living Off the Government? Race, Gender, and the Politics of Welfare,” work requirements place extra burdens on low-income families but do little to lift them out of poverty.
 
Work requirements for TANF
TANF gives families with very low incomes some cash they can spend on housing, food, clothing or whatever they need most. The Clinton administration launched it as a replacement for a similar program, Aid to Families with Dependent Children, in 1996. At the time, both political parties were eager to end a welfare system they believed was riddled with abuse. A big goal with TANF was ending the dependence of people getting cash benefits on the government by moving them from welfare to work.
Many people were removed from the welfare rolls, but not because work requirements led to economic prosperity. Instead, they had trouble navigating the bureaucratic demands.
TANF is administered by the states. They can set many rules of their own, but they must comply with an important federal requirement: Adult recipients have to work or engage in an authorized alternative activity for at least 30 hours per week. The number of weekly hours is only 20 if the recipient is caring for a child under the age of 6.
The dozen activities or so that can count toward this quota range from participating in job training programs to engaging in community service.
Some adults enrolled in TANF are exempt from work requirements, depending on their state’s own policies. The most common exemptions are for people who are ill, have a disability or are over age 60.
To qualify for TANF, families must have dependent children; in some states pregnant women also qualify. Income limits are set by the state and range from US$307 a month for a family of three in Alabama to $2,935 a month for a family of three in Minnesota.
Adult TANF recipients face a federal five-year lifetime limit on benefits. States can adopt shorter time limits; Arizona’s is 12 months.
 
An administrative burden
Complying with these work requirements generally means proving that you’re working or making the case that you should be exempt from this mandate. This places what’s known as an “administrative burden” on the people who get cash assistance. It often requires lots of documentation and time. If you have an unpredictable work schedule, inconsistent access to child care or obligations to care for an older relative, this paperwork is hard to deal with.
What counts as work, how many hours must be completed and who is exempt from these requirements often comes down to a caseworker’s discretion. Social science research shows that this discretion is not equally applied and is often informed by stereotypes.
The number of people getting cash assistance has fallen sharply since TANF replaced Aid to Families with Dependent Children. In some states caseloads have dropped by more than 50% despite significant population growth.
Some of this decline happened because recipients got jobs that paid them too much to qualify. The Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan office that provides economic research to Congress, attributes, at least in part, an increase in employment among less-educated single mothers in the 1990s to work requirements.
Not everyone who stopped getting cash benefits through TANF wound up employed, however. Other recipients who did not meet requirements fell into deep poverty.
Regardless of why people leave the program, when fewer low-income Americans get TANF benefits, the government spends less money on cash assistance. Federal funding has remained flat at $16.5 billion since 1996. Taking inflation into account, the program receives half as much funding as when it was created. In addition, states have used the flexibility granted them to direct most of their TANF funds to priorities other than cash benefits, such as pre-K education.
Many Americans who get help paying for groceries through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program are also subject to work requirements. People the government calls “able-bodied adults without dependents” can only receive SNAP benefits for three months within a three-year period if they are not employed.
 
A failed experiment in Arkansas
Lawmakers in Congress and in statehouses have debated whether to add work requirements for Medicaid before. More than a dozen states have applied for waivers that would let them give it a try.
When Arkansas instituted Medicaid work requirements in 2018, during the first Trump administration, it was largely seen as a failure. Some 18,000 people lost their health care coverage, but employment rates did not increase.
After a court order stopped the policy in 2019, most people regained their coverage.
Georgia is currently the only state with Medicaid work requirements in effect, after implementing a waiver in July 2023. The program has experienced technical difficulties and has had trouble verifying work activities.
Other states, including Idaho, Indiana and Kentucky, are already asking the federal government to let them enforce Medicaid work requirements.

The phenomenon is sometimes known as the “Proust Effect,” for a scene from Marcel Proust’s novel “Remembrance of Things Past,” when a character’s childhood memories come flooding back, triggered by the scent of a sweet cake called a madeleine.
For me it’s lilacs. Every Memorial Day of my childhood my mother would cut lilacs from the big bush near the back porch of our home in Grand Island. She would bunch them into bouquets and then send my sister and me in search of vases and mason jars to fill with water. 
On the trip to the cemetery in the back seat, my sister and I would hold tight to the lilacs and whatever else mom culled from our yard or that of a generous neighbor. Mom would manage my father’s driving to keep the sloshing to a minimum.
  Rich Gillham is shown a couple years before he died. (Submitted photo)
The car was thick with the unmistakable fragrance of lilacs, an aroma now permanently linked in my memory to Memorial Day. And, sadly, more.
The lilac bush was large enough that anyone passing by on the sidewalk enjoyed the scent.
Rich Gillham knew the smell.
He was two grades ahead of me in school and six blocks to the north of me on Kimball Street, but a childhood friend nonetheless, the way neighborhood friends know each other.
He would pedal by on his bicycle and then, as a teen he would zoom past on his motorcycle — sometimes stopping because he had me on the back hitching a ride home from football practice.
There was an uncluttered ease to Rich, a confidence that this 15-year-old, saddled with a high school sophomore’s lack of self-assurance and no driver’s license, admired.
My parents didn’t want me riding on a motorcycle, but they knew Rich and his parents, Gerald and Ursula, the way neighborhood parents know each other.
Rich never came by as an adult.
He was killed in a place called Dinh Tuong Province, thousands of miles from Kimball Street and the smell of lilacs. He was 20.
I’m not sure I’ll remember Rich more this Memorial Day than I do any other day. With war now a modern constant and young men and women from their own streets and neighborhoods in places we call harm’s way, he is more on my mind.
I paid my respects to Rich and others when the traveling wall made it to our hometown, where I was overcome with many emotions, not the least of which was the rushing back of a shared and gentle childhood.
War being what it is, we’re never far from paying respects and decorating graves and realizing the true and somber meaning of Memorial Day.
Vietnam was my generation’s war. Rich was my neighbor and friend who died there, whose life and death touched many, especially those of us from Kimball Street.
We played as kids. Our families shared dinners. Our parents laughed over beers.
In high school, Rich played football his senior year, never getting in a game, but sticking it out nonetheless. And he was always willing to throw me on the back of his little two-wheeler and take me home.
My best last memory of Rich was of him astride his new, powerful Triumph motorcycle, so loud a conversation next to it was impossible.
A group of us were parked at Nifty’s Drive-In on South Locust Street when we heard him coming on the Triumph, a growling, snarling monster in faded copper.
We were taken with the clamor and power … and Rich, nonchalant and indifferent to the stares from the curious, the impressed and the disgusted.
He turned it off for a few minutes for a little back and forth chatter, then stomped the Triumph a few times to bring it back to life. He sped off in a cloud of youth and noise.
We made a point to see how far he would get before we could no longer hear him. It was long after he drove out of sight, much to our delight and admiration.
Delight and admiration. That’s how I remember my neighbor, the first casualty of war from my childhood.
Come to think of it, delight and admiration could fit millions of memories on Memorial Day.
And maybe throw in the scent of lilacs, too.

When people picture families in need of support, they often think of new parents juggling diapers and daycare. And yes, those were challenging years. But the truth is, the financial stress doesn’t end when your child starts school. It changes and, in many ways, it gets even harder.
I’m the mother of two middle school boys. They’re funny, thoughtful, energetic, and I’m incredibly proud of the young men they’re becoming. But as they’ve grown, so have the costs of raising them. Like many parents across Connecticut, my family works hard and budgets carefully, but we are living in a time of economic strain. Every trip to the grocery store costs more than the last, and electricity rates are sky high.  
In this time of rising expenses, Connecticut—already one of the most expensive states in the country to live—remains the only state that taxes personal income without adjusting for family size. This includes all of our neighboring states. That means a single adult with no dependents pays the same rate as my family with two kids. It’s an outdated system that doesn’t reflect the cost of raising a family. 
That’s why I strongly support creating a fully refundable Connecticut Child Tax Credit. I’ll be honest — it won’t solve everything, but it will make a meaningful difference. 
This is a common-sense policy that would benefit more than 550,000 kids of all ages across our state until they reach the age of 17. It’s a practical, proven, and bipartisan solution. It’s time to make it real. 
Families across Connecticut are being asked to do more with less, and we simply can’t afford to wait any longer.

One such victim was our beloved son, Alec Pelletier, who died from fentanyl poisoning in 2018 while living in a sober home in Canaan.
Alec struggled with bipolar disorder and SUD for seven years. He was a sensitive, intelligent, funny young man, and a loving brother to his three siblings. In the end, Alec was fully engaged in recovery and looked forward to a spiritually fulfilling life of sobriety, empowered by the love of his family and friends. 

Dita Bhargava
The real tragedy of our family’s loss is how many others have been affected by the addiction crisis. More than 7,000 people in CT have suffered fatal overdoses since Alec’s passing. Connecticut residents are more likely to die from unintentional drug overdoses than from motor vehicle crashes. Many of these lives, including Alec’s, could have been saved if they had access to a safe place where an overdose could be reversed.
Victims of a broken system
Like many innocent people, Alec, a AAA hockey player, fell victim to easily accessible and highly addictive painkillers in his early teens. 
Big pharmaceutical companies misrepresented the addictive nature of these opioids. At the same time, FDA and government leaders failed to act promptly as the addiction crisis spread rapidly through communities. Then, foreign countries compounded the addiction crisis by flooding our nation with poisonous fentanyl, which ultimately took Alec’s life and is responsible for over 80% of overdoses in Connecticut. 
Congress was too slow to act. Our children deserved protection from the deceptive greed of big pharma and drug cartels.
Better standards of care in treatment facilities and sober homes is critical.  A few weeks before Alec overdosed, he was discharged from a treatment center in Kent, without being put on the only known evidenced-based protocol – Medically Assisted Treatment, and was referred to a home meant for people who had been sober for a year, even though Alec was only sober for three months.
 Overdose prevention centers will keep people alive
S.B. 7, also known as An Act Concerning Protections For Access To Health Care And The Equitable Delivery Of Health Care Services In The State, would allow for establishing safe, non-judgmental centers in Connecticut that provide a space where individuals struggling with SUD can have an overdose reversed and their lives saved. 
While opponents argue that OPCs enable drug use and pollute communities with crime and homelessness, decades of robust research demonstrate an association with reduced morbidity, mortality, and transmission of infectious diseases, improved individual health outcomes and services engagement, and cost-effectiveness. The FDA’s decision to make Naloxone available over the counter reflects a growing recognition of the efficacy of harm-reduction strategies. 
The widespread availability of Naloxone has played a pivotal role in decreasing overdose rates – OPCs are essentially an extension of Narcan distribution. OPCs also promote cleaner environments by keeping drug paraphernalia like syringes off the streets and keeping people from using them in the open public.
The Opposite of Addiction Is Connection
In six simple words, journalist Johann Hari summarized the profound importance of community and connection for those suffering from SUD. Co-existing disorders, such as mental health illnesses, often accompany addiction. Loneliness can lead to depression, anxiety, and other health problems.
Last summer, I was privileged to visit several overdose prevention centers in Canada, where they have operated for over two decades. The centers exude compassion, understanding, and love. Clients feel welcomed, valued, and connected.
According to reports, between 2017 and June 2023, over 49,000 overdoses and drug-related emergencies were attended to at these Canadian sites, with no recorded fatalities. Beyond emergency care, OPCs offer comprehensive resources, including addiction treatment, harm reduction services, health education, and necessities like food, water, and toiletries. Successful models also operate in neighboring states, New York and Rhode Island, where thousands of lives have been saved. Vermont and Minnesota are advancing similar initiatives.
The night Alec passed, on July 13, 2018, was especially devastating because Alec had been doing so well, giving us hope for his future. It was his 26th birthday, and we had discussed celebrating together just days earlier. However, addiction is a chronic disease with high relapse rates, and on that night, Alec succumbed to his cravings. His tolerance to opiates had diminished due to months of sobriety, making him especially vulnerable. 
Alec was aware of the dangers of fentanyl lacing and carefully placed a package of Narcan by his bedside in case of an overdose, but ashamed of relapse he decided to use alone. Young men right outside his sober homeroom were unaware Alec was in trouble. What good is Narcan if no one administers it? If Alec had connected to a safe, unbiased place in his moment of despair, where a healthcare provider could have given Naloxone, he would be here today.
The call for bold leadership
At a recent Hearing, State Sen. Heather Somers urged that the overdose epidemic not be labeled a public health crisis so that residents don’t bombard the Connecticut Department of Public Health for better solutions. 
Over the last two decades, over a million Americans, including thousands in Connecticut have vanished like Alec – children, siblings, friends, colleagues, and parents, because our society has failed to protect them. Overdose rates have increased in Connecticut by over 250% from 2014 to 2024. This is a public health crisis of epic scale, and we cannot shy away from that fact. 
Somers is also unduly concerned that OPCs are not a bridge to recovery. A study on an OPC in Vancouver showed a 30% increase in detoxification services uptake within a year. In another study, 42% of OPC participants not in treatment at baseline enrolled within 24 months
Gov. Ned Lamont once asked me what more we can do to address the overdose crisis in our state. Governor, act boldly and responsibly to help the vulnerable find life, recovery and hope. Please pass S.B. 7.

George Floyd’s death is a time that many remember as a “racial reckoning” that heightened the world’s attention on police brutality and its deadly impact on Black people.
Activists, leaders and community members believed five years ago that the country would point to this moment as the one that brought lasting change toward racial equity. Now, the majority of Americans say that moment has passed with its promise unfulfilled.
In a study published on May 7, the Pew Research Center found that in 2020, 52 percent of U.S. adults believed that an increased focus on racial issues across the country would lead to significant change in the years to come. In 2025, 72 percent of U.S. adults said that the focus on racial inequality did not lead to any changes that helped the Black community.

This report was originally published by The 19th. The Illuminator is a founding member of the 19th News Network.

Furthermore, in 2025, 67% of Black Americans said they felt doubtful the United States would ever achieve racial equality; 65% felt similarly in 2020.
The 19th spoke with Black activists about the country’s progress toward equality since Floyd’s death and how they envision a more inclusive future.
‘You have to do things to actually show how you feel’
Alaunna Thompson was attending a predominantly White high school in Montville, N.J., when Floyd died. His murder was a call for her to organize a protest in her local community, she said, describing her ongoing struggles with racism in school as the driver that pushed her to use her voice.

Protestors gathered at Mackay Park in Englewood, N.J., to demand justice after Floyd’s death. Following a route that led them around the city, participants stopped to deliver passionate speeches and craft signs that they would carry while organizing. Parents, teachers, students and Englewood residents all came out to support.
“It was a mix of us feeling some way about our school and on top of that, hearing all this stuff [about] Ahmaud Arbery, George Floyd. It was back to back to back.”
Arbery was a 25-year-old Black man who was shot and killed while on an afternoon jog in the Satilla Shores neighborhood of Georgia. Arbery’s death happened in February 2020, just months before Floyd’s.
Thompson remembers feeling sadness, anger and disbelief. With the stunting pain also came the realization that this time, something felt different.
“I saw people talking about [Floyd’s] drug charges and the things he did, and I was just, like, ‘Wow, this is really sad,’ and I felt angry about it. Honestly, I thought nothing would happen,” she said. When Derek Chauvin got arrested and convicted in federal court of killing Floyd, “that was a shock to me,” Thompson said. “That’s never really happened before.”
In Thompson’s eyes, while Floyd’s murder did not put an end to racially motivated violence, it did shift our social understanding of how we discuss police brutality. Up until the day of Floyd’s death in 2020, she had never witnessed so much language that reflected how brutal police violence is.
“People are more comfortable holding these police officers accountable now. I think versus the Trayvon Martin period, people were [thinking] these are not people who are going to get prosecuted because they are above the law,” she said. “They’re also more comfortable saying that this person killed this person instead of it being police brutality. This is murder.”
At just 17 years old, Martin was shot and killed while walking in Sanford, Florida. His killer, George Zimmerman, was the captain of Sanford’s neighborhood watch and reported to police that he saw a “suspicious person” prior to shooting Martin. Zimmerman was later found not guilty in the trial.
Although Thompson does not feel there has been effective systemic change in the five years since Floyd’s life was taken, she does recognize the impact that he has had. Her place in history is what will continue to compel her to use her voice, she said.
“It’s about history. It’s not about two little kids from Englewood who may not make that much of a difference when it comes to the law, but it makes a difference when it comes to which side of history you were on.”

‘The possibility that lies ahead’
Throughout her life, Angela Ferrell-Zabala has looked to the strength of her mother and grandmother to inspire her activism. At a young age, her family instilled in her the belief that she has a voice and the power to advocate against injustice in the world. As she grew older, she followed their lead in the work she’s done for her community.
As a mother of four living in Washington, D.C., she wanted to do something about gun violence in the city. So she joined Moms Demand Action, a gun violence prevention advocacy group. Three years ago, she became its first executive director.
Ferrell-Zabala felt that Floyd’s murder was a continuation of violence against Black and Brown people that had become normalized. While she helped the people in her community, she had to remember to give herself grace to deal with the emotional turmoil she was also experiencing.
“In the moment, you just want to make sure everyone’s OK,” she said. “You want to wrap your arms around them, but then there’s this point about ‘What do I need?’”
Five years later, Ferrell-Zabala said that it’s a hard moment for the country — and a hard moment for Black folks in particular. Decades of pain and trauma are continuing to impact the Black community, and many in the community feel like no one cares about the struggles they are facing.
For instance, Ferrell-Zabala said that Black people are disproportionately impacted when it comes to gun violence, and communities say that solutions aren’t meeting their needs fast enough. With corporations and the federal government rolling back inclusive programs that civil rights leaders fought hard for, many people have lost hope.
“Right now, it feels particularly difficult because there’s this sense of, ‘No one cares, no one gives a damn,’” she said. “But I think what makes it harder [is that] now, it’s beyond not caring. It [feels] like intentional cruelty.”
Ferrell-Zabala told The 19th that the country has a long way to go when it comes to creating true equality, equity and justice. She looks to her grandmother’s resilience as a reminder to keep working toward a better future. To move forward, she said that the Black community has to think about where they are and balance it with their radical visions of what could be.
“That’s one of the things I hold onto,” she said. “I hope many people hold onto who we are, where we come from and the possibility that lies ahead.”

‘We’re the only thing protecting each other’
Destine Riggins saved on her phone an album of pictures labeled Black Lives Matter March. She took these photos five years ago in West Jefferson, a town in the rural Appalachian Mountains of North Carolina. She was the sole photographer there.
Riggins used to look at the photos and see impact, unity and change. Now, when she looks at them, Riggins said she feels like “the whole world is against us again.”
“I feel like we’re in a worse scenario right now than we were five years ago. With the current administration we have, police brutality is easy for them to slip under the rug or even for a policeman to get off, especially with [President Donald] Trump wanting to pardon officers,” Riggins said.
Floyd’s murder immediately made Riggins think of Trayvon Martin and Sandra Bland, a Black woman roughly handled and arrested by the police in Texas and then found dead in her cell a few days later by what the local police consider suicide. There was also Sonya Massey, who was shot and killed in her home by the police last summer.
Since the march, Riggins has watched the national conversation around race and policing shift, making her feel tired, heavy and more unsure than ever.
“Each time we see these murders by the police it feels like another hit to the Black community. Another disappointment. Another reason to not like the cops. And another reason for a White man to be able to kill a Black man,” Riggins said.
Millions of people across the country have been protesting against the Trump administration through efforts like the Hands Off and 50501 movements. Many Black communities have decided on other forms of resistance and several people, like Riggins, are choosing to turn inward, by resting and leaning on their community for support.
“There is no protection for Black people except us, we’re the only thing protecting each other and right now that feels kind of disintegrating. My biggest opinion is to lay low right now,” Riggins said. “I don’t want to bring any extra attention to myself because I don’t have time to try to fight a justice system that was never meant for me in the first place.”

‘Police brutality shouldn’t just be personal to Black people’
While Riggins took pictures, Queue Wellington helped lead the march in West Jefferson, where more than 300 people protested in support of the Black Lives Matter movement.
Growing up Black in a rural, White, conservative and poor region, Wellington constantly saw how white supremacy and police brutality negatively impacted everyone.
“White people love to cling to power, but that power is white supremacy. As this country continues to lean overtly more into fascism and acceptance of police brutality, then that means Black people will keep dying, White people will keep dying and everyone will keep dying — largely by the hands of the police or people in power,” Wellington said.
After the summer of 2020, Wellington saw an increase in White people in their town attempting to unlearn anti-Black behavior, understand systemic issues and work in community with Black movements. Since then, they said those same people have faded away and that their actions were likely performative.
“There was a wave of White people trying to become more conscious or get more informed on things, but where are they now?” Wellington said. “Black people have always had to juggle it all at the same time: work, bills, lives and oppression.”
While Wellington feels that things aren’t better for Black Americans since the summer of racial reckoning, they do believe that at least more White people are grasping the reality of police brutality.
“If we can’t get a thousand White people to understand, maybe having one White person on board or seeing the reality of police brutality will change things or even create safer environments for Black folks,” Wellington said.
Wellington thinks this understanding could even be found in places like the Appalachian Mountains, where Stuart Mast, a White man, died while in deputies’ custody in a similar way to Floyd.
Several community members are outraged by Mast’s death, and people who once “backed the blue” are now questioning the system that police brutality has created.
“The fact that White people in my community are outraged over police violence feels oddly familiar. We should all be asking why folks are getting killed by the police. This murder has started to cause a divide between the police and White people here,” Wellington said. “Police brutality shouldn’t just be personal to Black people, but to everyone because it affects everyone.”

‘Our joy has to be non-negotiable’
In 2020, Monica Simpson and her community felt caught in the middle of challenging moments: Trump was finishing his first term and the COVID-19 pandemic was at its peak.
As the executive director of SisterSong, a reproductive rights group based in Atlanta, Simpson joined other members to create mutual aid opportunities for those in need and help pregnant women get access to birth workers.
Then Floyd was murdered. When the news broke, Simpson was immediately reminded of the other Black men and boys who were murdered by White men, such as Trayvon Martin and Tamir Rice — and the list keeps going, she said. But it felt like the world had to keep moving forward. Simpson had to continue doing the work for her community.
“We were having to still hold our community in all the ways that we need to for the work that we do every single day,” she said. “We had to be on the frontlines at the same time.”
At that time, the country saw what the media called a racial reckoning and Simpson felt that it took away from the grief the Black community was feeling after Floyd’s murder.
In 2025, with Trump back in power and making more changes to disenfranchise marginalized communities, Simpson feels that Black communities did as much as they could to restore what Trump’s 2016 administration destroyed. Black-led advocacy organizations came together, despite their contradictory beliefs, to put forth the work necessary to help their communities and each other.
Overall, Simpson said the Black community knew a second Trump presidency “would be detrimental.” Ninety-two percent of Black women voted for Kamala Harris during the 2024 presidential election and mobilized their communities. During his first five months in office, Trump has made strides to roll back diversity, equity and inclusion programs and positions in the federal government, and many corporations have followed suit.
“I think we’re in more danger now than we were before,” Simpson told The 19th. “We’re in the same position of our rights, our bodies, our communities being under attack.”
To create a more inclusive future, Simpson said that the Black community must continue to work together across religions, political values and identities because “disrespectability politics … have kept us divided.” The Black community has to come together to advocate for their needs, which includes educating each other, reclaiming their culture and embracing moments of joy.
“We need all the Black joy as possible because our joy has to be non-negotiable at this time,” she said. “That’s a powerful and necessary part of how we make it through.”

When the Navy first called to tell his daughter, Virginia Harbison, that her father’s remains had been identified, she hung up. At 91, living in assisted care in Texas, she could hardly believe it.

It was her son, Bill Ingram, who called her back to share the news again.
She was silent for so long that he had to ask if she was all right.
“Bill,” she said, “I hadn’t thought about that for 60 years.”
She has lived the full life her father never had the chance to. In March, Ingram pushed his mother in her wheelchair to her father’s gravesite for the burial.
“They fold the flag in this very tight, nice triangle, and then with white gloves, the commanding officer comes and takes it and kneels down and hands it to my mother,” said Ingram, who lives in San Francisco. “It was incredible.”
On Dec. 7, 1941, during the attack on Pearl Harbor, 429 service members aboard the USS Oklahoma died.
Horrifyingly, men trapped below deck after the ship capsized could be heard tapping out “SOS” in Morse code as the air supply dwindled. Though 32 men were rescued, the rest were tragically not reached in time.
After the war ended, the remains were recovered and buried in the National Cemetery of the Pacific in Hawaii, too water damaged and commingled to be identified individually. There they remained for years until modern science caught up with historical tragedy.
The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency (DPAA) disinterred the USS Oklahoma remains in 2015 to send to a DNA laboratory. Carrie LeGarde, a forensic archaeologist with the agency and project lead for the Oklahoma Project, said her team started the process by testing small pieces of bone for maternal line DNA. Overall, they inventoried 13,000 bones and took 4,900 DNA samples.
For Connolly, identification was complicated.
“We had several sequences that had multiple individuals, and that was actually the case with John Connolly, and part of why his identification occurred later in the project,” she said.
Since John Connolly was older than most of the men aboard the USS Oklahoma as one of the few officers on the ship and scheduled to retire just three weeks after the bombing, the team at DPAA relied on dental evidence in addition to DNA testing to confirm his identity.
Connolly was born in Savannah, Georgia, in 1893 and joined the Navy in 1912. He served during World War I and was eventually promoted to a chief warrant officer.
In 1941, his wife, Mary Connolly, and their two daughters, 8-year-old Virginia and 6-year-old Helen were eagerly awaiting his return and retirement in Long Beach, California, when the Navy informed them he had died.
Mary Connolly never remarried.
“She was very sad all her life because she married at age 30 or 31 and her husband was away in the service but was killed right before he was supposed to retire,” Ingram said.

 
Connolly’s memory has been passed down through the generations.
“We’ve taken my family to Hawaii, and we went to the memorial and found the marker for his name,” Ingram said.
Everything changed last year when Ingram got a call from the Navy.
In a 200-page report, the Navy detailed the historical background, identification process and scientific evidence.
“With the research that was involved, both with historical research and medical research, there’s a lot of folks at DPAA that are involved,” Navy POW/MIA branch head Richard Jenkins said. “We as a service will explain that to the family, with the hopes of them feeling comfortable with the findings and showing them that it’s not just any set of remains, it’s actually going to be that person.”
There’s a story that runs in Ingram’s family about his grandfather: A couple of years after World War II, a young man knocked on the family home and introduced himself to Virginia and Mary Connolly. He had been on the USS Oklahoma with John Connolly, he said, and when the ship was hit, Connolly pushed open a hatch and forced him out. Connolly had saved his life.
In 1944, the Navy re-commissioned one of their ships as the USS John Connolly. Though his story was a tragic one — an officer who never returned home whose remains were left unknown — history has granted him a second chance at closure. Over eight decades later, he got the hero’s burial he deserved.
“They did everything. They had a band. They played Taps. They fired the guns,” Ingram said. “Seven soldiers fired three times for a 21-gun salute.”
A final sendoff at last.

Kelly for KFF Health News)HENRICO, Virginia — Sheldon Ekirch spends a lot of time on hold with her health insurance company.
Sometimes, as the minutes tick by and her frustration mounts, Ekirch, 30, opens a meditation app on her phone. It was recommended by her psychologist to help with the depression associated with a stressful and painful medical disorder.
In 2023, Ekirch was diagnosed with small fiber neuropathy, a condition that makes her limbs and muscles feel as if they’re on fire. Now she takes more than a dozen prescriptions to manage chronic pain and other symptoms, including insomnia.
“I don’t feel like I am the person I was a year-and-a-half ago,” said Ekirch, who was on the cusp of launching her law career, before getting sick. “Like, my body isn’t my own.”
Ekirch said specialists have suggested that a series of infusions made from blood plasma called intravenous immunoglobulin — IVIG, for short — could ease, or potentially eradicate, her near-constant pain. But Ekirch’s insurance company has repeatedly denied coverage for the treatment, according to documents provided by the patient.
Patients with Ekirch’s condition don’t always respond to IVIG, but she said she deserves to try it, even though it could cost more than $100,000.
“I’m paying a lot of money for health insurance,” said Ekirch, who pays more than $600 a month in premiums. “I don’t understand why they won’t help me, why my life means so little to them.”
For patient advocates and health economists, cases like Ekirch’s illustrate why prior authorization has become such a chronic pain point for patients and doctors. For 50 years, insurers have employed prior authorization, they say, to reduce wasteful health care spending, prevent unnecessary treatment, and guard against potential harm.
The practice differs by insurance company and plan, but the rules often require patients or their doctors to request permission from the patient’s health insurance company before proceeding with a drug, treatment, or medical procedure.
The insurance industry provides little information about how often prior authorization is used. Transparency requirements established by the federal government to shed light on the use of prior authorization by private insurers haven’t been broadly enforced, said Justin Lo, a senior researcher for the Program on Patient and Consumer Protections at KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.
Yet it’s widely acknowledged that prior authorization tends to disproportionately impact some of the sickest people who need the most expensive care. And despite bipartisan support to reform the system, as well as recent attempts by health insurance companies to ease the burden for patients and doctors, some tactics have met skepticism.
Some insurers’ efforts to improve prior authorization practices aren’t as helpful as they would seem, said Judson Ivy, CEO of Ensemble Health Partners, a revenue cycle management company.
“When you really dive deep,” he said, these improvements don’t seem to touch the services and procedures, such as CT scans, that get caught up in prior authorization so frequently. “When we started looking into it,” he said, “it was almost a PR stunt.”
 
  The ‘Tipping Point’ 

When Arman Shahriar’s father was diagnosed with follicular lymphoma in 2023, his father’s oncologist ordered a whole-body PET scan to determine the cancer’s stage. The scan was denied by a company called EviCore by Evernorth, a Cigna subsidiary that makes prior authorization decisions.
Shahriar, an internal medicine resident, said he spent hours on the phone with his father’s insurer, arguing that the latest medical guidelines supported the scan. The imaging request was eventually approved. But his father’s scan was delayed several weeks — and multiple appointments were scheduled, then canceled during the time-consuming process — while the family feared the cancer would continue to spread.
EviCore by Evernorth spokesperson Madeline Ziomek wrote in an emailed statement that incomplete clinical information provided by physicians is a leading cause of such denials. The company is “actively developing new ways to make the submission process simpler and faster for physicians,” Ziomek said.
In the meantime, Shahriar, who often struggles to navigate prior authorization for his patients, accused the confusing system of “artificially creating problems in people’s lives” at the wrong time.
“If families with physicians are struggling through this, how do other people navigate it? And the short answer is, they can’t,” said Shahriar, who wrote about his father’s case in an essay published last year by JAMA Oncology. “We’re kind of reaching a tipping point where we’re realizing, collectively, something needs to be done.”
The fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson on a New York City sidewalk in December prompted an outpouring of grief among those who knew him, but it also became a platform for public outrage about the methods insurance companies use to deny treatment.
An Emerson College poll conducted in mid-December found 41% of 18- to 29-year-olds thought the actions of Thompson’s killer were at least somewhat acceptable. In a NORC survey from the University of Chicago conducted in December, two-thirds of respondents indicated that insurance company profits, and their denials for health care coverage, contributed “a great deal/moderate amount” to the killing. Instagram accounts established in support of Luigi Mangione, the 26-year-old Maryland suspect accused of murder and terrorism, have attracted thousands of followers.
“The past several weeks have further challenged us to even more intensely listen to the public narrative about our industry,” Cigna Group CEO David Cordani said during an earnings call on Jan. 30. Cigna is focused on “making prior authorizations faster and simpler,” he added.
The first Trump administration and the Biden administration put forth policies designed to improve prior authorization for some patients by mandating that insurers set up electronic systems and shortening the time companies may take to issue decisions, among other fixes. Hundreds of House Democrats and Republicans signed on to co-sponsor a bill last year that would establish new prior authorization rules for Medicare Advantage plans. In January, Republican congressman Jefferson Van Drew of New Jersey introduced a federal bill to abolish the use of prior authorization altogether.
Meanwhile, many states have passed legislation to regulate the use of prior authorization. Some laws require insurers to publish data about prior authorization denials with the intention of making a confusing system more transparent. Reform bills are under consideration by state legislatures in Hawaii and elsewhere. A bill in Virginia approved by the governor March 18 takes effect July 1. Other states, including Texas, have established “gold card” programs that ease prior authorization requirements for some physicians by allowing doctors with a track record of approvals to bypass the rules.
No one from AHIP, an insurance industry lobbying group formerly known as America’s Health Insurance Plans, was available to be interviewed on the record about proposed prior authorization legislation for this article.
But changes wouldn’t guarantee that the most vulnerable patients would be spared from future insurance denials or the complex appeals process set up by insurers. Some doctors and advocates for patients are skeptical that prior authorization can be fixed as long as insurers are accountable to shareholders.
Kindyl Boyer, director of advocacy for the nonprofit Infusion Access Foundation, remains hopeful the system can be improved but likened some efforts to playing “Whac-A-Mole.” Ultimately, insurance companies are “going to find a different way to make more money,” she said.
 
In the weeks following Thompson’s killing, UnitedHealthcare was trying to refute an onslaught of what it called “highly inaccurate and grossly misleading information” about its practices when another incident landed the company back in the spotlight.
On Jan. 7, Elisabeth Potter, a breast reconstruction surgeon in Austin, Texas, posted a video on social media criticizing the company for questioning whether one of her patients who had been diagnosed with breast cancer and was undergoing surgery that day needed to be admitted as an inpatient.
The video amassed millions of views.
In the days following her post, UnitedHealthcare hired a high-profile law firm to demand a correction and public apology from Potter. In an interview with KFF Health News, Potter would not discuss details about the dispute, but she stood by what she said in her original video.
“I told the truth,” Potter said.
The facts of the incident remain in dispute. But the level of attention it received online illustrates how frustrated and vocal many people have become about insurance company tactics since Thompson’s killing, said Matthew Zachary, a former cancer patient and the host of “Out of Patients,” a podcast that aims to amplify the experiences of patients.
For years, doctors and patients have taken to social media to shame health insurers into approving treatment. But in recent months, Zachary said, “horror stories” about prior authorization shared widely online have created “unified anger.”
“Most people thought they were alone in the victimization,” Zachary said. “Now they know they’re not.”
Data published in January by KFF found that prior authorization is particularly burdensome for patients covered by Medicare Advantage plans. In 2023, virtually all Medicare Advantage enrollees were covered by plans that required prior authorization, while people enrolled in traditional Medicare were much less likely to encounter it, said Jeannie Fuglesten Biniek, an associate director at KFF’s Program on Medicare Policy. Furthermore, she said, Medicare Advantage enrollees were more likely to face prior authorization for higher-cost services, including inpatient hospital stays, skilled nursing facility stays, and chemotherapy.
But Neil Parikh, national chief medical officer for medical management at UnitedHealthcare, explained prior authorization rules apply to fewer than 2% of the claims the company pays. He added that “99% of the time” UnitedHealthcare members don’t need prior authorization or requests are approved “very, very quickly.”
Recently, he said, a team at UnitedHealthcare was reviewing a prior authorization request for an orthopedic procedure when they discovered the surgeon planned to operate on the wrong side of the patient’s body. UnitedHealthcare caught the mistake in time, he recounted.
“This is a real-life example of why prior authorization can really help,” Parikh said.
Even so, he said, UnitedHealthcare aims to make the process less burdensome by removing prior authorization requirements for some services, rendering instant decisions for certain requests, and establishing a national gold card program, among other refinements. Cigna also announced changes designed to improve prior authorization in the months since Thompson’s killing.
“Brian was an incredible friend and colleague to many, many of us, and we are deeply saddened by his passing,” Parikh said. “It’s truly a sad occasion.”
[subhed] The Final Denial 

During the summer of 2023, Ekirch was working full time and preparing to take the bar exam when she noticed numbness and tingling in her arms and legs. Eventually, she started experiencing a burning sensation throughout her body.
That fall, a Richmond-area neurologist said her symptoms were consistent with small fiber neuropathy, and, in early 2024, a rheumatologist recommended IVIG to ease her pain. Since then, other specialists, including neurologists at the University of Virginia and Virginia Commonwealth University, have said she may benefit from the same treatment.
There’s no guarantee it will work. A randomized controlled trial published in 2021 found pain levels in patients who received IVIG weren’t significantly different from the placebo group, while an older study found patients responded “remarkably well.”
“It’s hard because I look at my peers from law school and high school — they’re having families, excelling in their career, living their life. And most days I am just struggling, just to get out of bed,” said Ekirch, frustrated that Anthem continues to deny her claim.
In a prepared statement, Kersha Cartwright, a spokesperson for Anthem’s parent company, Elevance Health, said Ekirch’s request for IVIG treatment was denied “because it did not meet the established medical criteria for effectiveness in treating small fiber neuropathy.”
On Feb. 17, her treatment was denied by Anthem for the final time. Ekirch said her patient advocate, a nurse who works for Anthem, suggested she reach out to the drug manufacturer about patient charity programs.
“This is absolutely crazy,” Ekirch said. “This is someone from Anthem telling me to plead with a pharmacy company to give me this drug when Anthem should be covering it.”
Her only hope now lies with the Virginia State Corporation Commission Bureau of Insurance, a state agency that resolves prior authorization disputes between patients and health insurance companies. She found out through a Facebook group for patients with small fiber neuropathy that the Bureau of Insurance has overturned an IVIG denial before. In late March, Ekirch was anxiously waiting to hear the agency’s decision about her case.
“I don’t want to get my hopes up too much, though,” she said. “I feel like this entire process, I’ve been let down by it.”

(Photo by Shahrzad Rasekh/CT Mirror)Connecticut officials reached a settlement with Prospect Medical Holdings clearing a path for the operator to permanently shutter all services aside from the emergency room and behavioral health at Rockville General Hospital in Vernon, according to an agreement published on May 23.
Rockville is one of three hospitals in Connecticut owned by Los Angeles-based Prospect Medical Holdings, which filed for bankruptcy in January.
The settlement signed on Friday between Prospect and the state of Connecticut concludes an ongoing state investigation into unauthorized service cuts at Rockville launched in October of last year. Prospect agreed that Connecticut will have a $300,000 claim included in the bankruptcy case as a result of the termination of services, subject to approval by the court.
The terms require Prospect to maintain emergency services at Rockville for three years and keep existing inpatient behavioral health services “at or within 30 miles of their current location on the RGH campus.” However, it doesn’t require the operator to reopen services that were cut without state permission.
The agreement also grants Prospect permission from the state’s Office of Health Strategy, or OHS, to terminate Rockville’s status as a full-service acute care hospital and convert it into a satellite campus of Manchester Memorial Hospital, located 20 minutes away. Prospect must now also obtain permission for the consolidation from the Department of Public Health, which oversees hospital licensing, Wendy Fuchs, a spokesperson for OHS confirmed.
A spokesperson for the Department of Public Health did not immediately respond to a request for comment late Friday.
In a Friday press release, OHS Commissioner Deidre Gifford said the agreement “protects critical resources” for patients and families in the area.
“The agreement also holds the Prospect applicants accountable to the community, requiring public notice of past terminations and development of a strategic plan for the consolidated hospital.  The plan must be developed with community input and presented to the community in a public forum,” Gifford’s statement read.
The agreement requires Prospect to announce the consolidation of Rockville with Manchester Memorial publicly, create an interim strategic plan for services at Rockville and hold a community forum within 60 days.
Spokespeople with Prospect Medical Holdings and Eastern Connecticut Health Network, which owns Rockville General and Manchester Memorial, did not respond to a request for comment.
In March, Suzanne Koenig, a bankruptcy-court appointed patient care ombuds reported that, during a visit to Rockville General, she found that surgical services, as well as the intensive care and medical-surgical units at the hospital had remained closed since March 2020. The company did not receive state permission to permanently close any of those services in advance of doing so.
State law defines a termination of services as “the cessation of any services for a period greater than one hundred eighty days.” Termination of services by a hospital without state approval can result in civil penalties of up to $1,000 per day.
The unauthorized cuts were the subject of an October 2023 investigation by the Connecticut Mirror.
When Prospect filed for bankruptcy earlier this year, state officials offered assurances that its three Connecticut hospitals would remain open and operating.
​​“Some people think bankruptcy means the lights go out and the party’s over. That’s not true at all. These hospitals are very successful,” Lamont said during a press conference in the days following the bankruptcy announcement.
Although Rockville General will technically remain operational, it will no longer be a stand-alone, full-service acute care hospital.
A spokesperson for Lamont did not return a request for comment.
Rep. Tammy Nuccio, R-Tolland, whose district contains Rockville General Hospital, said Friday that the state had failed her residents.
“Profit over people. That’s what I think we’ve come to expect here unfortunately from OHS and the state when it comes to health care for residents that are not in large cities,” Nuccio said.
The agreement with the state will be binding for any future buyers of Prospect’s Connecticut hospitals.
Yale New Haven Health first reached a tentative agreement to purchase the three facilities from Prospect for $435 million in 2022. But the deal has been mired in complications since then, including lawsuits and, most recently, Prospect’s bankruptcy. In February, Yale said it would be “impossible” to close the deal.
An auction process for the Prospect-owned hospitals will take place through bankruptcy court.
In the state’s Friday announcement, OHS said the process is “ongoing.” In court documents, the sale hearing was tentatively scheduled for June 5, but no notice of hearing has been officially posted and spokespeople for Prospect and their lawyers have not responded to multiple requests regarding the auction timeline.

If enacted, the budget moves would wreak havoc on campuses everywhere, but especially at the nation’s 1,100 community colleges, including 15 here in Massachusetts, which enroll a third of America’s undergraduates, including the poorest, most underserved and vulnerable students in all of higher education. 
The post Trump cuts would devastate community colleg[...]","FOR THE PAST few months, America’s most prestigious universities have been under attack by a president intent on chastening “woke elites” and flexing his political muscle to show that not even the world’s most esteemed institutions of higher learning are beyond his control. But while public attention has been focused on Ivy-leaguers like Harvard, Columbia, and the University of Pennsylvania striking deals or filing lawsuits to protect the billions of dollars in federal funding and other public subsidies they receive, another, potentially more dire threat has received much less coverage. It’s a threat with far more sweeping consequences for American higher education and the preparation of the nation’s future workforce. Congress is considering dramatic changes to federal financial aid that would disproportionately harm community college students, and President Trump has presented a budget for next year that would eliminate nearly every form of federal support for the nation’s most disadvantaged students and institutions. In a surprise move during Congress’s budget reconciliation process, the House Education and Workforce Committee has recommended major changes to the federal Pell Grant program, which awards around $30 billion annually to more than six million low-income students, while at the same time President Trump has released his proposed budget for fiscal year 2026, which would eliminate TRIO programs aiding first-generation college students, federal Work-Study, and other programs that support college access and success. Taken together, if enacted, the budget moves would wreak havoc on campuses everywhere, but especially at the nation’s 1,100 community colleges, including 15 here in Massachusetts, which enroll a third of America’s undergraduates, including the poorest, most underserved and vulnerable students in all of higher education. The Pell Grant: A Pathway to College for Millions For more than half a century, the Pell Grant Program has provided assistance to students with exceptional financial need, offering them a more affordable pathway to a college degree.  While the grant originally paid for nearly all the cost of attending college, including tuition and living expenses, over the years it has not kept up with inflation. Still, it provides up to $7,400 a year per student, about 25 percent of the cost of attending a public university, and half the cost of enrolling at a community college. Right now, the Pell Grant guidelines define a full-time student as someone enrolled in 12 or more credits. Students can take any number of credits each semester they are enrolled and can qualify for a prorated amount of Pell Grant support based on their courseload.   For example, a low-income student taking twelve credits would qualify for the full $7,400 award, while the same student taking three credits would only qualify for 25 percent, or $1,850, of the that amount. The changes to the Pell Grant recommended by the House committee would make it harder to qualify for support by redefining full-time enrollment as at least 15 credits and eliminating funding for students enrolled less than halftime, or 7.5 credits. Students attending four-year universities would barely notice the difference: Nearly 90 percent of them are enrolled full-time and would not be affected by the changes. At community colleges though, where students are older and often balancing classes with jobs and families, two-thirds of them are enrolled part-time, and the proposed changes to the Pell Grant would have an immediate, devastating effect on community college student enrollment nationwide. At Northern Essex Community College, nearly half of our students are currently eligible for Pell Grants. This semester, 78 percent are enrolled part-time.  They take an average of just over 7.5 credits each semester, though the most common number of credits taken is only 6. If the proposed Pell Grant changes were implemented, they would impact nearly 3,000 students at NECC, eliminating more than $5 million in financial aid, and likely cutting enrollment by a third or more. Across all fifteen community colleges in Massachusetts, the changes would affect tens of thousands of students, slashing over $80 million in support and decimating enrollment at the state’s community colleges. To add injury to injury, the state’s free community college programs, MassReconnect and MassEducate, are “last dollar in” programs that rely on federal Pell Grants.   If Massachusetts had to cover the lost $80 million, especially facing an increasingly bleak budget year ahead, those programs, which were designed to meet the Commonwealth’s future workforce needs, might not be able to continue, and the state’s anticipated college-educated worker shortage would get even worse. Student Support Services Endangered While the House committee’s Pell Grant changes would likely result in millions of students dropping out of community colleges because of lost financial aid, the president’s proposed $4 billion budget reductions to the federal TRIO, GEAR UP, Work Study, Child Care and other student support programs would endanger the prospects of those who still managed to enroll. All of the cuts would be harmful, especially to community college students, but the most significant reductions are to TRIO, which is actually a collection of eight different programs, including Upward Bound, Talent Search, and Student Support Services, all designed to support low-income students, those who are the first in their families to attend college, and students with disabilities. Altogether, there are more than 3,500 TRIO projects serving nearly 900,000 students across the country for just under $2 billion annually.  While outcomes may vary by project, collectively research has shown that TRIO programs have a significant positive impact on college enrollment, retention, and graduation for the students they serve. As an example: For more than four decades, Northern Essex Community College’s TRIO-funded PACE Program has served around 250 first generation, low-income students a year, providing them with study skills workshops and coaching, essay writing tutorials, internship opportunities, field trips to four-year universities, and access to transfer scholarships. The results are spectacular: Every year, persistence, academic standing, and graduation rates for PACE students are 20-30 percent higher than the overall student population, all at a cost of just $1,500 or so annually for each student, an amazing return on investment. Each of the programs the president is aiming to eliminate serves a marginalized, at-risk population of students, such as those with the greatest need for financial assistance, single parents, first generation students, veterans, or students with disabilities; or provides assistance to under-resourced institutions like community colleges or schools that, based on their  enrollment demographics, are designated as minority serving institutions. An Existential Threat to the Safety Net Every budget is a reflection of someone’s priorities.  Those priorities can be debated, and reasonable minds may disagree, but whether you support it or not, President Trump’s fiscal year 2026 budget represents the most extreme reductions to America’s social safety net programs proposed by any president in modern history. It recommends cutting nondefense discretionary funding, mostly resources for education (like the TRIO Program), health, and housing programs that benefit the poor, by $163 billion to the lowest level since recordkeeping began in the 1960s, in order to fund more defense and border security spending, and extend his 2017 tax cuts, which have primarily benefitted corporations, investors, and the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans. While the president insists he is putting “America first” and delivering national economic prosperity with his “Big, Beautiful Bill,” the budget working its way through Congress, if adopted, would inflict enormous damage on disadvantaged populations nationwide.  When it comes to community colleges, it’s doing anything but putting America – and Americans — first. These cuts will pull the rug out from under working-class Americans who are trying hard to better their lives and that of their family — and whose efforts will boost America’s economy and global competitiveness in the process.  It is a vision, and a budget, we must vigorously oppose.  Lane Glenn is president of Northern Essex Community College.  The post Trump cuts would devastate community colleges, undermining lower-income students striving to better their lives   appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/massbay-e1707743859561.jpeg?fit=1024%2C577&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-25 11:02:14.982163

Credit: Tracey AttleeMore than 80 years after he died in the attack on Pearl Harbor, John Connolly was finally laid to rest – not as an unknown in a mass grave, but as a naval officer in Arlington National Cemetery. 
When the Navy first called to tell his daughter, Virginia Harbison, that her father’s remains had been identified, she hung up. At 91, living in assisted care in Texas, she could hardly believe it. It was her son, Bill Ingram, who called her back to share the news again. She was silent for so long that he had to ask if she was all right. “Bill,” she said, “I hadn’t thought about that for 60 years.”
She has lived the full life her father never had the chance to. In March, Ingram pushed his mother in her wheelchair to her father’s gravesite for the burial. 
“They fold the flag in this very tight, nice triangle, and then with white gloves, the commanding officer comes and takes it and kneels down and hands it to my mother,” said Ingram, who lives in San Francisco. “It was incredible.”
On Dec. 7, 1941 during the attack on Pearl Harbor, 429 service members aboard the USS Oklahoma died. Horrifyingly, men trapped below deck after the ship capsized could be heard tapping out “SOS” in Morse code as the air supply dwindled. Though 32 men were rescued, the rest were tragically not reached in time. 
After the war ended, the remains were recovered and buried in the National Cemetery of the Pacific in Hawaii, too water damaged and commingled to be identified individually. There they remained for years until modern science caught up with historical tragedy. 
The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency disinterred the USS Oklahoma remains in 2015 to send to a DNA laboratory. Carrie LeGarde, a forensic archaeologist with the agency and project lead for the Oklahoma Project, said her team started the process by testing small pieces of bone for maternal line DNA. Overall, they inventoried 13,000 bones and took 4,900 DNA samples. For Connolly, identification was complicated. 
“We had several sequences that had multiple individuals, and that was actually the case with John Connolly, and part of why his identification occurred later in the project,” she said.

Since John Connolly was older than most of the men aboard the USS Oklahoma as one of the few officers on the ship and scheduled to retire just three weeks after the bombing, the team at DPAA relied on dental evidence in addition to DNA testing to confirm his identity. 
Connolly was born in Savannah in 1893 and joined the Navy in 1912. He served during World War I and was eventually promoted to a chief warrant officer. In 1941, his wife, Mary Connolly, and their two daughters, eight-year-old Virginia and six-year-old Helen were eagerly awaiting his return and retirement in Long Beach, California, when the Navy informed them he had died. 
Mary Connolly never remarried. 
“She was very sad all her life because she married at age 30 or 31 and her husband was away in the service, but was killed right before he was supposed to retire,” Ingram said. 
Connolly’s memory has been passed down through the generations.
“We’ve taken my family to Hawaii, and we went to the memorial and found the marker for his name,” Ingram said. 
Everything changed last year when Ingram got a call from the Navy. In a 200-page report, the Navy detailed the historical background, identification process and scientific evidence.

“With the research that was involved, both with historical research and medical research, there’s a lot of folks at DPAA that are involved,” Navy POW/MIA branch head Richard Jenkins said. “We as a service will explain that to the family, with the hopes of them feeling comfortable with the findings and showing them that it’s not just any set of remains, it’s actually going to be that person.”
There’s a story that runs in Ingram’s family about his grandfather. A couple of years after World War II, a young man knocked on the family home and introduced himself to Virginia and Mary Connolly. He had been on the USS Oklahoma with John Connolly, he said, and when the ship was hit, Connolly pushed open a hatch and forced him out. Connolly had saved his life. 
In 1944, the Navy re-commissioned one of their ships as the USS John Connolly. Though his story was a tragic one – an officer who never returned home whose remains were left unknown – history has granted him a second chance at closure. Over eight decades later, he got the hero’s burial he deserved. 
“They did everything. They had a band. They played Taps. They fired the guns,” Ingram said. “Seven soldiers fired three times for a 21-gun salute.” 
A final sendoff at last.

(Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)During her tenure as the governor of South Dakota, Kristi Noem liked to remind legislators at budget time that the money they were dealing with was not their own. 
From a 2019 address to the Legislature: “I’m committed to maintaining the fiscal integrity for which our state is known. We won’t spend money we don’t have. We will not raise taxes.”
From 2022: “I recognize that taxpayer dollars are not our own — they belong to the people of South Dakota. We all must remember throughout our budget discussions that this money belongs to the hard-working people of South Dakota.”
From 2025: “During my time as governor, I have always kept my budget proposals focused on our people, not government programs. After all, this is the people’s money. They entrust it to us and expect us to spend it wisely and responsibly.”

Those are good reminders that legislators should take to heart. However, it seems that Noem was just reading from the teleprompter rather than paying attention to her own advice. Recently Noem’s actions with taxpayer dollars were the topic of discussion on a couple of fronts. 
A South Dakota Searchlight story noted that the Government Operations and Audit Committee in Pierre was trying to get answers about how Noem rang up $750,000 on her state credit card during her six years as governor. Noem admonished lawmakers to look out for the way taxpayer dollars were spent while she was racking up travel expenses on a book tour, a Canadian hunting excursion and various out-of-state political trips to tout the hopes of Republican candidates, including Donald Trump. 
Who’s to say if South Dakota will ever have another governor like Noem who became the darling of the Republican Party for her reaction to the pandemic. During her many travels, she was quick to praise South Dakota’s maskless response to the pandemic and just as quick to label as fake news anyone who dared point out that the state was leading the league in per capita COVID-19 deaths. 
Lawmakers on the committee learned that under the current laws, there isn’t much that state bookkeepers can do when called on to cover a governor’s credit card expenses. They can question a credit card charge, but if it isn’t then handled voluntarily by the elected official, the state has to pay. 
Basically, the current law treats elected officials like adults. As adults, those officials should know when the people should pay and when they should reach into their own wallets to cover any expense that doesn’t directly have anything to do with their elected positions. Given the example Noem set, lawmakers who took her advice about fiscal integrity seriously are now faced with proposing legislation that calls for creating some sort of credit card overseer or nanny. That’s a move that wouldn’t be needed if Noem’s credit card use was more statesmanlike instead of resembling a sailor on leave. 
Another Searchlight story published on the same day chronicled Noem’s appearance before the U.S. Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security. At the meeting, Noem had it pointed out that her new department has budget problems. 
“Your department is out of control,” said Sen. Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut. “You are running out of money.”
Given that Noem has been given responsibility for Trump’s signature issue — immigration control — it would certainly be a bad look for the president if the department charged with rounding up illegal immigrants ran out of funds before the end of the fiscal year. Fiscal restraint may be the order of the day as Noem works for a man who changes Cabinet secretaries the way other presidents changed their socks. 
For her part, Noem doesn’t seem like she’s pinching pennies, spending $100 million on TV commercials that praise Trump policies and warn immigrants not to come to the United States illegally. 
She has also unveiled a plan to offer $1,000 in “travel assistance” to illegal immigrants who self-deport. The cost of that could be as much as $1 billion if Trump reaches his goal of deporting 1 million people. Those hardly seem like the actions of someone who has been entrusted by taxpayers to spend their funds “wisely and responsibly.”

All the permits for the project have been approved, and Blanchard is in the process of finalizing the logistics for the move.Once the 1952 Worcester Diner Company diner car owned by Theresa Taylor is relocated, Blanchard Contracting employees will install a 15-by-30-foot kitchen on the back of it. The projected cost is around $350,000, and Taylor is self-funding the majority of the project, she said.Taylor, who has owned the diner for more than 15 years, said she hopes to reopen it by the end of August.The diner closed in January after Blanchard Contracting workers who were set to pour a new concrete floor in the basement of the diner’s current location discovered more structural issues. The land where the diner currently sits is owned by an economic development nonprofit organization, the Windsor Improvement Corporation.More than a year ago, the Guy B Vitagliano Foundation, which Blanchard founded to help improve the quality of life for people in the town, purchased 161 Main St., a roughly 1-acre plot. Current plans call for the diner to occupy the front portion of the property and the foundation is still working on plans for the rest of the site.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Windsor Diner gets town approval to relocate.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Windsor-Diner-Vermont.jpg,,,2025-05-25 08:59:50.767216

Like many moderate-income workers, public school teachers Julia and Scott Whitnall didn’t think they’d become homeowners in their early 30s. Especially in California.
“We never felt homeownership was in our cards. But we did it!” Julia Whitnall said. “We’re extremely happy.”
The couple moved May 16 to a $509,000 two-bedroom house in Ripon, east of San Francisco in the Central Valley region.
It wasn’t easy. Despite a relatively high combined income of $140,000 from their nearby jobs, they had to compromise on size and take on extra work at summer camps to pull it off. Then they had to exercise patience as the sellers struggled to find a new home.
High interest rates and high prices in a still-competitive housing market continue to make it tough for first-time buyers, even those with good but moderate incomes.
The number of new apartments is at a 50-year high, but states expect a slowdown

On a national level, households making $75,000 to $100,000 — typical of teachers, nurses and skilled trades workers in many states — face a daunting lack of homes they can afford. That’s according to new research by the National Association of Realtors and Realtor.com based on listings in March of this year compared with 2024. However, the numbers showed an encouraging 20% increase in homes for sale, affordable or not.
Despite more houses for sale, those moderate-income buyers — which the report called “middle- and upper-middle-income buyers” — are much more hard-pressed to find an affordable home than they were in 2019, when almost half the homes on the market were affordable to them. This year they can afford only 21.2% of homes on the market — a slight improvement compared with 20.8% in 2024, according to the report.
It also found that a few states are improving in affordability for people in the $75,000-to-$100,000 income range. But many states are not.
The largest affordability gaps are in California, Hawaii, Idaho, Massachusetts and Montana, where such households can afford fewer than 12% of houses on the market. By contrast, they could afford about half the houses for sale in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Ohio and West Virginia.
There’s progress in states that are adding more housing at moderate price points: Arizona, Colorado, Delaware, Florida and Utah, according to the Realtors report.

Balanced markets
Nationwide, to get home markets back in line with moderate-income families, the United States needs 416,000 more homes for sale at or below $255,000, according to the report.
“In many places, we’re still seeing a huge mismatch between income levels and what’s available to buy for moderate-income families,” said Nadia Evangelou, the National Association of Realtors’ senior economist and director of real estate research.
“We are no longer in crisis mode, but we are still very far from where we need to be. We can’t fix it overnight. It will take years,” Evangelou said.

Heather, who asked not to share her last name for privacy reasons, said she can’t even think of buying a house near her job on Long Island, New York. She makes more than $100,000 as a registered nurse and her family makes $170,000 with her husband’s job in building maintenance. But $4,400 in rent and $2,000 in monthly day care costs for three children have them living paycheck to paycheck.
“We can’t even afford a small car repair, let alone a mortgage in our hometown” of Ronkonkoma in Suffolk County, Heather said. Their jobs exposed her and her husband to risks in the pandemic that her neighbors avoided with remote work, she said. But she now feels like she’s in worse shape financially than she was in 2019 and considers moving away.
“All of our hard work feels like it was for nothing,” Heather said. “It’s disheartening that we can’t afford to live where we grew up, but that’s the reality we are facing.”
Some states can still be a refuge of affordability.
Ashley and Tristan Jonas bought a $252,000 house in northwest Ohio after three years of getting shut out by higher or all-cash offers. Ashley Jonas, 32, trained as a teacher but now works in skilled trades as a project coordinator for a countertop company, and the couple makes about $140,000 with Tristan Jonas’ job as a computer programmer.
“We happened to hit the market at the right time in 2025,” Ashley Jonas said. “We bid on this house just as [President Donald] Trump was announcing tariffs. I think a lot of people were holding their coin purses. We weren’t.”
Help for teachers
Teachers, who generally make less than nurses or trades workers, are particularly squeezed. Some states, facing teacher shortages in local schools, are working to raise pay. And increasingly, some schools and hospitals are providing housing to lure more teachers and nurses.
“We lose so many teachers because they can’t find housing here,” said Autumn Rivera, a 20-year teaching veteran and 2022 Colorado Teacher of the Year. Despite her experience and credentials, Rivera said she can’t contemplate buying even a townhouse in the rural resort town of Glenwood Springs, where she teaches.
Fast-building states get more babies

Prices for those townhouses now start in the $700,000 range, more than twice what they were when she last considered buying in 2019. Rivera feels lucky to have a reasonable rent by sharing a home with its owner, but many teachers in her Roaring Fork Schools need the 117 apartments provided by the district with affordable rent, she said. The district hopes the apartments will allow teachers to save up for a home; it has also built 14 houses for staff with Habitat for Humanity and Holy Cross Energy.
One way to make homebuying more feasible for teachers is to pay them more — a strategy that paid off for New Mexico, one of the few bright spots in a different report on teachers’ inability to afford housing, which was published this month by the National Council on Teacher Quality, a research and advocacy group.
Beginning teachers in Albuquerque saw a 60% increase in pay between 2019 and 2025, which fell just short of a 65% jump in home prices, according to the report. The report credited a state law that raised teacher salaries, including starting pay, by $10,000.
“We’re dealing with the issue of teachers being able to live in the communities where they’re actually working,” said state Rep. Joy Garratt, a Democrat who sponsored a new law, signed in April, that sets higher minimum salaries for teachers effective July 1.
Detroit schools also gave teachers with advanced degrees a pay boost of up to 50% since 2019, about the same increase as home prices, according to the report from the National Council on Teacher Quality. Albuquerque and Detroit are on the report’s list of most affordable places for beginning teachers to live.
But nationally, on average, experienced teachers who started in 2019 are less able to afford a home now than when they began, according to the report.
“Teacher pay has gone up 24% in the last five years, which some might say is solid growth, and yet the increase in house for purchase has gone up 47%,” said Heather Peske, the organization’s president.
“Housing prices are critical to being able to attract and keep great teachers,” Peske said. “People will be leaving the profession trying to find something that pays enough for housing. And bottom line, kids won’t get as good an education.”

Forecasters at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration expect above-average hurricane activity this season.
The federal agency, in its annual outlook released Thursday, predicted 13 to 19 named storms, including six to 10 hurricanes. Of those, it expects three to five major hurricanes of category 3, 4 or 5 strength, packing winds of 111 mph or greater.
The agency said there was a 60 percent chance of an above-normal season, a 30 percent chance of a near-normal season and a 10 percent chance of a below-normal season. The forecast represents an estimate of activity, not number of landfalls.

The average season features 14 named storms, including seven hurricanes and three major hurricanes, according to NOAA. The season begins June 1 and ends Nov. 30.
“We’re ready here at NOAA,” said Ken Graham, director of the National Weather Service, during a news briefing held in Gretna, Louisiana, to mark 20 years since Hurricane Katrina. “Are you?”
NOAA based its forecast on a confluence of factors, including warmer than average ocean temperatures, potentially weak wind shear and the possibility of higher activity from the West African Monsoon, a primary starting point for Atlantic hurricanes. Warmer oceans fuel storms with more energy, while weaker winds allow them to develop without disruption.
Forecasters at Colorado State University also anticipate an above-average season, with 17 named storms—including nine hurricanes, four of them major. The forecasters predicted activity would be about 125 percent of that during an average season between 1991 and 2020.
By comparison, activity in 2024 was about 130 percent of an average season’s during that time. The 2024 season will be best-remembered for hurricanes Helene and Milton, which together caused more than 250 fatalities and $120 billion in damage across the Southeast.
The Colorado State University forecasters said this season there is a 51 percent chance of a major hurricane striking the U.S., with a 26 percent chance of one of the storms making landfall along the East Coast and 33 percent chance along the Gulf Coast. They predict a 56 percent chance of a major hurricane tracking through the Caribbean.
The season arrives amid widespread uncertainty over the role the federal government will play in disaster response and recovery, as the Trump administration fires employees, freezes funding and dismantles agencies. NOAA and the Federal Emergency Management Agency are among the targets.
“Uncertainty is not great,” said Phil Klotzbach, a senior research scientist at Colorado State University’s Department of Atmospheric Science. “It just adds another layer of stress. That isn’t great when people are trying to prepare for hurricane season.”
As much as 30 percent of the workforce at NOAA’s National Weather Service has been eliminated, said Rick Spinrad, a former NOAA administrator under the Biden administration. He worried NOAA may struggle to maintain its Hurricane Hunter flights, which he said account for a 15 percent improvement in track and intensity forecasting.
“If you lose that capacity to predict the track, you could either unnecessarily evacuate tens or hundreds of thousands of people, or evacuate the wrong people or not evacuate people who should be evacuated,” he said. “So we are putting lives and property in significant danger with the degradation of the forecast capability.”
No changes to the flights have been proposed, said Michael “Mac” McAlister, who has flown with the Hurricane Hunters for 10 years. This will be the 50th season for one of the two aircraft involved in the program, a WP-3D Orion named Kermit. The other plane is called Miss Piggy.
“There are hardly any 50-year-old pieces of this aircraft left,” McAlister said, referring to Kermit. “The wings get chopped off every five years. In my opinion these are two of the greatest national assets, because of the data they provide.”
No one from the National Hurricane Center, a division of the National Weather Service, attended this year’s National Hurricane Conference in New Orleans, said Craig Fugate, a former FEMA administrator under the Obama administration and former director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management.
Normally the National Hurricane Center would brief state and local emergency managers at the conference on new forecasting methods, to help the managers improve communications with the public about, say, when evacuations are necessary. The training is important because there can be high turnover among emergency managers, he said.
“I’m just not aware of any other time that the hurricane center staff wasn’t at that conference,” Fugate said.
NOAA declined to comment on the conference but said Thursday its forecasts would be no less accurate. For instance, the federal agency said the model used to predict hurricanes would undergo an upgrade that would improve track and intensity forecasts by as much as 5 percent.
“We are fully staffed at the Hurricane Center, and we are definitely ready to go,” said Laura Grimm, acting NOAA administrator. “We are really making this a top priority for the administration.”
Kim Doster, the agency’s communications director, added in a statement, “in the near term, NWS has updated the service level standards for its weather forecast offices to manage impacts due to shifting personnel resources. These revised standards reflect the transformation and prioritization of mission-essential operations, while supporting the balance of the operational workload for its workforce. NWS continues to ensure a continuity of service for mission-critical functions.”
Meanwhile, FEMA is in turmoil, with President Donald Trump suggesting he might eliminate the federal agency. Cameron Hamilton, acting head of FEMA, was ousted earlier this month after testifying before a congressional subcommittee that elimination would not be “in the best interest of the American people.” His dismissal coincided with National Hurricane Preparedness Week, declared by Trump in a proclamation in which the president said he remained “steadfastly committed to supporting hurricane recovery efforts and ensuring that Federal resources and tax dollars are allocated to American citizens in need.”
But during Trump’s first week in office he appointed a task force to review FEMA’s ability to respond to disasters. And in March he signed an executive order asserting that federal policy must “recognize that preparedness is most effectively owned and managed at the State, local, and even individual levels.” The order called on state and local governments and individuals to “play a more active and significant role in national resilience and preparedness.”
In April the administration denied a request for assistance from Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, a Republican, after tornadoes ripped through several counties there. The administration approved the request in May.
Nonetheless, FEMA told Inside Climate News in a statement, before Hamilton was fired, that its response to disasters would not be diminished.
“Unlike the previous administration’s unprepared, disgraceful and inadequate response to natural disasters like Hurricane Helene, the Trump administration is committed to ensuring Americans affected by emergencies will get the help they need in a quick and efficient manner,” the statement reads. “All operational and readiness requirements will continue to be managed without interruption in close coordination with local and state officials ahead of the 2025 Hurricane Season. Emergency management is best when led by local and state authorities.”
In Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis welcomed the prospect of more state leadership in disaster response. During an April event in Kissimmee he said he believed the Trump administration would send block-grant funding to states, which could manage the calamities more efficiently.
“We’re not going to be left in the cold. But I can tell you that the FEMA bureaucracy is an impediment to disaster recovery,” said DeSantis, who ran against Trump in the 2024 Republican primary. “We’re nimble. We’re quick. We adjust. So empower the states. Give us the resources, and we don’t necessarily need the federal government to be involved at all.”
But state and local governments already lead the response to disasters, Fugate notes. Governors request federal help only when the scope of the crisis exceeds the state’s capabilities, with the federal government providing little more than funding.
He said it was too soon to guess how all of the developments may affect hurricane season.
Even more cuts could be coming
Trump’s budget request, released earlier this month, would slash more than $1.3 billion from NOAA and $646 million from FEMA. Congress must approve the proposal.
An earlier leaked draft, obtained by Inside Climate News, would abolish NOAA’s research office, called Oceanic and Atmospheric Research or NOAA Research. The office is charged with providing unbiased science to, among other things, improve forecasts and enhance warnings ahead of disasters. The draft included $171 million for the office, down from $485 million in 2024. The few programs that remain, including research into severe storms, would be moved primarily to the National Weather Service and National Ocean Service.
The Trump administration’s 2026 budget passback, as the draft was called, included “significant reductions to education, grants, research, and climate-related programs within NOAA,” according to the document. “Passback levels support a leaner NOAA that focuses on core operational needs, eliminates unnecessary layers of bureaucracy, terminates nonessential grant programs and ends activities that do not warrant a Federal role.”
Project 2025, the conservative strategy for remaking the federal government, calls for NOAA to be taken apart, with many functions eliminated, privatized or moved to other agencies or state and local governments. The document suggests reforming FEMA to shift much of its spending on preparedness and response to state and local governments.
“We’re just providing as accurate information as we can,” said Andy Hazelton, a National Weather Service scientist who was let go earlier this year. “Hopefully we can get back to that, but it’s been a very, very tough environment for the last few months.”
In central Florida, all of the uncertainty has left Alan Harris, the emergency manager in Seminole County, grappling with how to prepare for hurricane season. Seminole is a suburban county north of Orlando that is spliced through by the St. Johns River, Florida’s longest. The county has experienced flooding during several recent hurricanes, including Ian in 2022 and Milton in 2024.
The agency depends on forecasts from the National Weather Service and National Hurricane Center and assistance from FEMA after a storm has passed. It had applied for a grant for a new generator for a special needs shelter under the federal Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program, which Trump signed into law in 2020. But the Trump administration ended the program recently.
“We at the local level are going to make sure that our residents are taken care of regardless of what happens at the federal or state level,” Harris said. “We will need help. We just don’t know where that help is going to come from. But I have 100 percent confidence that there will be help whether it’s through mutual aid agreements or it’s from other states or our own state. We’re going to make sure our residents are taken care of.”

Lancaster Hill and other Black Americans in the Massachusetts Bay colony, “who are detained in a state of Slavery in the Bowels of a free & Christian Country,” declared in a petition that they were born free just like the white citizens and “have never forfeited this Blessing by any compact or agreement whatever.” 
Seven years later, Elizabeth “Bett” Freeman heard that the new Massachusetts Constitution said every person had a right to freedom. The next day, she approached a lawyer and was quoted as asking, “I heard that paper read yesterday, that says, all men are created equal, and that every man has a right to freedom.” She said she wanted her freedom, too. The lawyer agreed and filed a lawsuit on behalf of her and another African American. 
In 1781, the case went to court, and a jury ruled in her favor, making her the first Black woman set free under the Massachusetts state constitution. 
“Any time while I was a slave,” she said, “if one minute’s freedom had been offered to me and I had been told I must die at the end of that minute, I would have taken it, just to stand one minute on God’s earth a free woman!”
At the same time, Quock Walker sued his former master, Nathaniel Jennison, for battery. After the local courts ruled in his and Freeman’s favor, they pressed the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court on whether the state’s Constitution applied to those enslaved. That challenge led to Supreme Court Chief Justice William Cushing’s conclusion that slavery was “inconsistent with our own conduct and Constitution.”

(Photo: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)It took six months, but the race for the North Carolina Supreme Court is finally over. The rules of the game held – just as they did following the 2020 election – and the winner is now in office.
That’s a win for democracy.
And we owe that win in large part to an exceptionally strong ruling from Trump-appointed judge Richard E. Myers II, chief judge of the Eastern District of North Carolina.    
While other branches might be absent (Congress), or ambivalent on whether or not it has to follow the Constitution (Executive), the federal judiciary continues to hold the line.
North Carolina is one of seven states that has partisan elections for its judges. In the November 2024 election for one of North Carolina’s Supreme Court seats, Democrat Allison Riggs defeated Republican Jefferson Griffin by 734 votes. Out of 5,540,090 votes. Griffin challenged the results in court, as is his right.
Included in Griffin’s challenges were attempts to retroactively challenge the state’s election laws, and then use the new understanding of the law to throw out 60,000 presumptively-valid votes. All based in election denial conspiracies.
Such an effort violates two important principles of how our elections are run: 1) You can’t change the rules of the game after the game, and 2) You can’t punish voters for following the rules as they were understood at the time.
These principles are what kept Al Gore from invalidating 25,000 likely-Republican votes in Florida in the 2000 presidential election, and they’re what allow for finality in election results.
The North Carolina Court of Appeals and the North Carolina Supreme Court shocked the election community by partially indulging Griffin’s after-the-fact challenges. They showed they were willing to set a dangerous precedent of legitimizing false claims of voter fraud, especially in close margin races. 
If the North Carolina Supreme Court’s decision had held, and if it had gained popularity in other state courts, then we would have been in a world of trouble for 2026. Elections would drag on for months.  
For example, if I, in Arizona, narrowly lost an election, but then challenged the legality of mail balloting, then that legal theory would have to be fully litigated before calling an end to the election. Despite the fact that I could have challenged the legality of mail voting before the election.  
Imagine if the election in dispute had been a seat in Congress. Or if the partisan balance of Congress had only been divided by one vote. Would we have been waiting until May to seat the Speaker of the House?
Maybe then it would’ve gotten more attention nationally. It flew largely under the radar for many Americans. And who can blame them? Democracy is under attack from so many angles, who can keep up?
The truth is, election denial was alive and well in North Carolina this election cycle. But ultimately, the federal courts stepped in and settled the race once and for all.
Judge Myers didn’t hesitate to rebuke the problematic nature of such an approach. He wrote: “A post-election change of practice that results in the discarding of votes is abominable under the Constitution of the United States.” 
Griffin ultimately called off the fight and conceded to Riggs, allowing her to, finally, be sworn in to a new term on the North Carolina Supreme Court.
As long as I wasn’t one of the candidates, nor a North Carolina citizen looking for finality, there’s a silver lining. The ruling provided a persuasive refresher on election law for judges.  It came from the chief judge of a district. It came from a Republican-appointed judge. It came from a Trump-appointed judge. 
Don’t get me wrong. The lawsuit threatened to undermine the legitimacy of our election system and silence the eligible voters. It’s going to take time for pro-democracy officials in North Carolina, and across our country, to rebuild trust in our election system.
We have the federal courts to thank for keeping our election system free, fair, and secure this cycle. I firmly believe that almost all federal judges consistently do the right thing according to fact and law, regardless of their politics. But for those who think the judiciary is just “politics in robes,” we couldn’t have asked for a better ambassador for election-law-sanity than we got in this federal court.
As I have said many times over the past few months, thank goodness for our federal judiciary, one which continues to be the envy of the world.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/P5131673-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-25 08:00:23.919638

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Lisa Jablow: Preparing for hound training season.","Dear Editor,Hounding involves releasing packs of dogs to chase wildlife, such as bears, bobcats, foxes, coyotes and raccoons until the animals are cornered, treed (forced up a tree) or simply too exhausted to continue. The hound “training” season begins on June 1 in Vermont and lasts all summer long, offering wildlife little reprieve from harassment. The practice can be particularly traumatic at this time of year for mother animals and their offspring. Hounding occurs on both public and private lands, raising ethical and legal concerns among property owners and outdoor recreationists who fear run-ins with uncontrolled hounds. It causes extreme stress and suffering for both the hunted animals and the hounds, especially when violent encounters occur between the dogs and their quarry, sometimes resulting in severe injuries or death. Young wild animals who can’t outrun the hounds stand little chance of escape.  Hounding also disturbs the peace of public lands and occurs on private properties without consent. It often lacks meaningful regulation or enforcement, especially during the training period. Raccoon, bobcat and fox hounding, for example, are governed by few regulations, allowing hounders to run their dogs even in the middle of night.If you’re looking to take action, there are several potential steps:Contact legislators to advocate for restrictions or bans on hound hunting.

Fern was known for her kindness, joy and strong connection to nature. We are also deeply troubled by the outcome of the trial of Seth Brunell, which failed to deliver justice for Fern. This injustice was not merely an isolated incident. It is part of a broader, deeply rooted pattern of violence and neglect that transgender people face across the United States.READ MORE
Our Quaker faith teaches that there is that of God in everyone. This belief calls us to affirm the dignity, worth and spiritual gifts of all people. Our community is enriched by the presence of transgender and gender diverse individuals. Transgender people deserve not only affirmation, but protection. To honor Fern is to reject the negligence and prejudice that enable transphobia to thrive in courtrooms, police departments, and legislatures. It is to recognize that the criminal legal system is not only broken, but structurally incapable of serving the communities most impacted by violence.Vermont has taken crucial steps towards creating a safe and inclusive environment for transgender people. However, we still must hold our public institutions accountable. When our system fails to uphold justice for Fern, it has failed all of us. We must allow ourselves to grieve, but it is equally important to transform that grief into courage, solidarity and love towards the transgender community. We recognize that honoring each person’s self-identified gender is a spiritual practice rooted in love and truth. As Friends, we are called to speak out against injustice and to work towards a world where all people can live free from fear and violence. Fern’s life reminds us of the beauty and resilience of transgender people.

This story was originally reported by Alexis Wray, Eden Turner and Sabreen Dawud of The 19th. Meet Alexis, Eden and Sabreen and read more of their reporting on gender, politics and policy.
Sunday is the fifth anniversary of George Floyd’s death, a time that many remember as a “racial reckoning” that heightened the world’s attention on police brutality and its deadly impact on Black people.
Activists, leaders and community members believed five years ago that the country would point to this moment as the one that brought lasting change toward racial equity. Now, the majority of Americans say that moment has passed with its promise unfulfilled.
In a study published on May 7, the Pew Research Center found that in 2020, 52 percent of U.S. adults believed that an increased focus on racial issues across the country would lead to significant change in the years to come. In 2025, 72 percent of U.S. adults said that the focus on racial inequality did not lead to any changes that helped the Black community.
Furthermore, in 2025, 67 percent of Black Americans said they felt doubtful the United States would ever achieve racial equality; 65 percent felt similarly in 2020.
The 19th spoke with Black activists about the country’s progress toward equality since Floyd’s death and how they envision a more inclusive future.
 ‘You have to do things to actually show how you feel’

Alaunna Thompson was attending a predominantly White high school in Montville, N.J., when Floyd died. His murder was a call for her to organize a protest in her local community, she said, describing her ongoing struggles with racism in school as the driver that pushed her to use her voice.

Protestors gathered at Mackay Park in Englewood, N.J., to demand justice after Floyd’s death. Following a route that led them around the city, participants stopped to deliver passionate speeches and craft signs that they would carry while organizing. Parents, teachers, students and Englewood residents all came out to support.
“It was a mix of us feeling some way about our school and on top of that, hearing all this stuff [about] Ahmaud Arbery, George Floyd. It was back to back to back.”
Arbery was a 25-year-old Black man who was shot and killed while on an afternoon jog in the Satilla Shores neighborhood of Georgia. Arbery’s death happened in February 2020, just months before Floyd’s.
Thompson remembers feeling sadness, anger and disbelief. With the stunting pain also came the realization that this time, something felt different.
“I saw people talking about [Floyd’s] drug charges and the things he did, and I was just, like, ‘Wow, this is really sad,’ and I felt angry about it. Honestly, I thought nothing would happen,” she said. When Derek Chauvin got arrested and convicted in federal court of killing Floyd, “that was a shock to me,” Thompson said. “That’s never really happened before.”
In Thompson’s eyes, while Floyd’s murder did not put an end to racially motivated violence, it did shift our social understanding of how we discuss police brutality. Up until the day of Floyd’s death in 2020, she had never witnessed so much language that reflected how brutal police violence is.
“People are more comfortable holding these police officers accountable now. I think versus the Trayvon Martin period, people were [thinking] these are not people who are going to get prosecuted because they are above the law,” she said. “They’re also more comfortable saying that this person killed this person instead of it being police brutality. This is murder.”
At just 17 years old, Martin was shot and killed while walking in Sanford, Florida. His killer, George Zimmerman, was the captain of Sanford’s neighborhood watch and reported to police that he saw a “suspicious person” prior to shooting Martin. Zimmerman was later found not guilty in the trial.
Although Thompson does not feel there has been effective systemic change in the five years since Floyd’s life was taken, she does recognize the impact that he has had. Her place in history is what will continue to compel her to use her voice, she said.
“It’s about history. It’s not about two little kids from Englewood who may not make that much of a difference when it comes to the law, but it makes a difference when it comes to which side of history you were on.”

 ‘I hope many people hold onto … the possibility that lies ahead’

Throughout her life, Angela Ferrell-Zabala has looked to the strength of her mother and grandmother to inspire her activism. At a young age, her family instilled in her the belief that she has a voice and the power to advocate against injustice in the world. As she grew older, she followed their lead in the work she’s done for her community.
As a mother of four living in Washington, D.C., she wanted to do something about gun violence in the city. So she joined Moms Demand Action, a gun violence prevention advocacy group. Three years ago, she became its first executive director.
Ferrell-Zabala felt that Floyd’s murder was a continuation of violence against Black and Brown people that had become normalized. While she helped the people in her community, she had to remember to give herself grace to deal with the emotional turmoil she was also experiencing.
“In the moment, you just want to make sure everyone’s OK,” she said. “You want to wrap your arms around them, but then there’s this point about ‘What do I need?’”
Five years later, Ferrell-Zabala said that it’s a hard moment for the country — and a hard moment for Black folks in particular. Decades of pain and trauma are continuing to impact the Black community, and many in the community feel like no one cares about the struggles they are facing.
For instance, Ferrell-Zabala said that Black people are disproportionately impacted when it comes to gun violence, and communities say that solutions aren’t meeting their needs fast enough. With corporations and the federal government rolling back inclusive programs that civil rights leaders fought hard for, many people have lost hope.
“Right now, it feels particularly difficult because there’s this sense of, ‘No one cares, no one gives a damn,’” she said. “But I think what makes it harder [is that] now, it’s beyond not caring. It [feels] like intentional cruelty.”
Ferrell-Zabala told The 19th that the country has a long way to go when it comes to creating true equality, equity and justice. She looks to her grandmother’s resilience as a reminder to keep working toward a better future. To move forward, she said that the Black community has to think about where they are and balance it with their radical visions of what could be.
“That’s one of the things I hold onto,” she said. “I hope many people hold onto who we are, where we come from and the possibility that lies ahead.”

 ‘We’re the only thing protecting each other’

Destine Riggins saved on her phone an album of pictures labeled Black Lives Matter March. She took these photos five years ago in West Jefferson, a town in the rural Appalachian Mountains of North Carolina. She was the sole photographer there.
Riggins used to look at the photos and see impact, unity and change. Now, when she looks at them, Riggins said she feels like “the whole world is against us again.”
“I feel like we’re in a worse scenario right now than we were five years ago. With the current administration we have, police brutality is easy for them to slip under the rug or even for a policeman to get off, especially with [President Donald] Trump wanting to pardon officers,” Riggins said.
Floyd’s murder immediately made Riggins think of Trayvon Martin and Sandra Bland, a Black woman roughly handled and arrested by the police in Texas and then found dead in her cell a few days later by what the local police consider suicide. There was also Sonya Massey, who was shot and killed in her home by the police last summer.
Since the march, Riggins has watched the national conversation around race and policing shift, making her feel tired, heavy and more unsure than ever.
“Each time we see these murders by the police it feels like another hit to the Black community. Another disappointment. Another reason to not like the cops. And another reason for a White man to be able to kill a Black man,” Riggins said.
Millions of people across the country have been protesting against the Trump administration through efforts like the Hands Off and 50501 movements. Many Black communities have decided on other forms of resistance and several people, like Riggins, are choosing to turn inward, by resting and leaning on their community for support.
“There is no protection for Black people except us, we’re the only thing protecting each other and right now that feels kind of disintegrating. My biggest opinion is to lay low right now,” Riggins said. “I don’t want to bring any extra attention to myself because I don’t have time to try to fight a justice system that was never meant for me in the first place.”

 ‘Police brutality shouldn’t just be personal to Black people’

While Riggins took pictures, Queue Wellington helped lead the march in West Jefferson, where more than 300 people protested in support of the Black Lives Matter movement.
Growing up Black in a rural, White, conservative and poor region, Wellington constantly saw how white supremacy and police brutality negatively impacted everyone.
“White people love to cling to power, but that power is white supremacy. As this country continues to lean overtly more into fascism and acceptance of police brutality, then that means Black people will keep dying, White people will keep dying and everyone will keep dying — largely by the hands of the police or people in power,” Wellington said.
After the summer of 2020, Wellington saw an increase in White people in their town attempting to unlearn anti-Black behavior, understand systemic issues and work in community with Black movements. Since then, they said those same people have faded away and that their actions were likely performative.
“There was a wave of White people trying to become more conscious or get more informed on things, but where are they now?” Wellington said. “Black people have always had to juggle it all at the same time: work, bills, lives and oppression.”
While Wellington feels that things aren’t better for Black Americans since the summer of racial reckoning, they do believe that at least more White people are grasping the reality of police brutality.
“If we can’t get a thousand White people to understand, maybe having one White person on board or seeing the reality of police brutality will change things or even create safer environments for Black folks,” Wellington said.
Wellington thinks this understanding could even be found in places like the Appalachian Mountains, where Stuart Mast, a White man, died while in deputies’ custody in a similar way to Floyd.
Several community members are outraged by Mast’s death, and people who once “backed the blue” are now questioning the system that police brutality has created.
“The fact that White people in my community are outraged over police violence feels oddly familiar. We should all be asking why folks are getting killed by the police. This murder has started to cause a divide between the police and White people here,” Wellington said. “Police brutality shouldn’t just be personal to Black people, but to everyone because it affects everyone.”

 ‘Our joy has to be non-negotiable’

In 2020, Monica Simpson and her community felt caught in the middle of challenging moments: Trump was finishing his first term and the COVID-19 pandemic was at its peak.
As the executive director of SisterSong, a reproductive rights group based in Atlanta, Simpson joined other members to create mutual aid opportunities for those in need and help pregnant women get access to birth workers.
Then Floyd was murdered. When the news broke, Simpson was immediately reminded of the other Black men and boys who were murdered by White men, such as Trayvon Martin and Tamir Rice — and the list keeps going, she said. But it felt like the world had to keep moving forward. Simpson had to continue doing the work for her community.
“We were having to still hold our community in all the ways that we need to for the work that we do every single day,” she said. “We had to be on the frontlines at the same time.”
At that time, the country saw what the media called a racial reckoning and Simpson felt that it took away from the grief the Black community was feeling after Floyd’s murder.
In 2025, with Trump back in power and making more changes to disenfranchise marginalized communities, Simpson feels that Black communities did as much as they could to restore what Trump’s 2016 administration destroyed. Black-led advocacy organizations came together, despite their contradictory beliefs, to put forth the work necessary to help their communities and each other.
Overall, Simpson said the Black community knew a second Trump presidency “would be detrimental.” Ninety-two percent of Black women voted for Kamala Harris during the 2024 presidential election and mobilized their communities. During his first five months in office, Trump has made strides to roll back diversity, equity and inclusion programs and positions in the federal government, and many corporations have followed suit.
“I think we’re in more danger now than we were before,” Simpson told The 19th. “We’re in the same position of our rights, our bodies, our communities being under attack.”
To create a more inclusive future, Simpson said that the Black community must continue to work together across religions, political values and identities because “disrespectability politics … have kept us divided.” The Black community has to come together to advocate for their needs, which includes educating each other, reclaiming their culture and embracing moments of joy.
“We need all the Black joy as possible because our joy has to be non-negotiable at this time,” she said. “That’s a powerful and necessary part of how we make it through.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/george-floyd-square-1024x593.jpeg,,,2025-05-25 07:01:24.182156

If the tidegates on No Name Slough — an estuary at the Skagit River delta — appear to be stained, crusted and a bit sagging with age, it could be because they are 60 years old.
If they fail, 450 acres of prime farmland could be inundated with salt water spilling in from Padilla Bay, and lost to farming.
The Skagit Delta tidegates have a simple purpose: to drain farmland when the tide goes out, then block incoming tides when they come lapping at the gate. The Skagit River delta produces about 90% of the agricultural value of all farms in Skagit County. Some of the highest value crops — spinach and cabbage seed, wheat and barley — grow on the soil protected by the diking districts.
The gates have made the Skagit River delta one of the state’s most productive farmland areas, acre for acre, for 140 years. Now, the future of farming on 60,000 acres of delta land protected by a network of dikes and 100 tidegates can no longer be assumed.
The issue is now being fought in federal court. A lawsuit brought by Skagit Dike, Drainage and Irrigation Improvement District 12 seeks to overturn a biological opinion by National Marine Fisheries Service, or NMFS, that the district says imposed onerous impact fees for merely repairing existing infrastructure.
The fate of the Skagit delta’s highly fertile farmland is inextricably intertwined with that of the Chinook salmon, classified as threatened under the Endangered Species Act, or ESA.
The district lost its request for summary judgement  in the first round on April 28, when U.S. District Court Judge Brian A. Tsuchida ruled for NMFS on all key claims. The decision was based on review of documents filed by both sides.
Tsuchida’s decision mooted his earlier decision in 2024 that the district could proceed with repairs because NMFS had taken too long in its environmental review of the tidegate repair permit.
At issue, notes the ruling, is “NMFS’ conclusion that the No Name Slough tidegate project would further reduce the quality and perpetuate poor conditions of nearshore and estuary habitat for Puget Sound Chinook for an additional 50 years” — thus necessitating habitat mitigation and restoration. In bringing suit, District 12 contends the project is “a simple tidegate replacement which does not expand the footprint of existing structures, and provides benefits to fish.”
Commissioners of the district voted on May 12 to file an appeal with the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. A hearing before a three-judge appeals panel is not yet scheduled.
 ‘Disappointed’

Jenna Friebel, executive director of the consortium that represents all 12 diking districts, said her organization “disagrees with and is disappointed with the district court’s decision.”
A rule that NMFS adopted in November of 2020 imposes substantial mitigation fees for any nearshore infrastructure repairs, from tidegates to Port of Seattle piers.
The No Name Slough tidegates are the first in the Skagit delta system to face the consequences of the rule. Before the change, the Skagit Tidegate Fish Initiative, or TFI, in 2010 established a system whereby tidegate improvements could be made without having to go to NMFS for permission for every individual project.
The Diking District 12 tidegate replacement on No Name Slough has been pending for four years, since the district’s original application for a permit approval from NMFS.
The ruling expands the baseline for determining effects of a repair project from the immediate vicinity of the work to the entire Puget Sound range of Chinook salmon. The next step under ESA, unless conditions for Chinook recovery show improvement, would be to declare the species endangered, triggering more stringent rules to protect the fish.
The rule also has been extended to include repairs to public infrastructure such as piers, waterfront bulkheads, ports and any other project that NMFS decides must involve mitigation fees.
 Added cost for district

For District 12, that would add $2.5 million in mitigation fees on top of whatever it costs to replace the tidegate and repairs to a section of the dike around it. What NMFS wants to have mitigated is the subject of a lawsuit the district filed against the agency last December.
Tsuchida sided with the federal fisheries agency on virtually every issue, citing at one point the “deference” given to NMFS as the source of expertise and scientific knowledge on the ESA.
Despite disagreement with the ruling, “our member districts remain committed to working with state and federal resource agencies and local tribes to develop solutions to the complex at hand that are grounded in facts and science,” Friebel said.
Senior Civil Prosecutor Will Honea, who deals with natural resource issues, said that Skagit County government has no direct stake in the District 12 lawsuit against NMFS.
“However,” he said, “We are concerned that NMFS’s single-minded focus on punitive regulatory measures is preventing productive progress in the Skagit, damaging the Skagit fisheries resource, hampering our ability to prepare for sea level rise and climate change and creating unnecessary conflict in our community.”
NMFS officials have declined to comment on the ruling.
 Swinomish perspective

The TFI was intended to make the process of obtaining permits for work on tidegates easier for applicants. The Army Corps of Engineers was empowered to issue permits directly for tidegate repairs under terms of the TFI approved by NMFS. It created an oversight board consisting of dike district representatives, the Swinomish Indian Tribal Community and Skagit County, state Fish and Wildlife and NMFS, with a staff member acting as coordinator.
The program included a system by which districts could acquire “credits” by doing work that made “operational improvements” to their tidegate systems. Districts could do the work even if they did not have any credits stored.
The Swinomish objected, complaining that the districts were using the operational improvements to do work that was more than the system should have allowed. The tribe gave 60 days notice of intent to sue NMFS. The tribe threatened to sue the Corps of Engineers for approving the District 12 work after its own finding that the project would have minimal effect on the threatened Chinook.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/tidegate.jpg,,,2025-05-25 07:01:24.182156

The panelists’ remarks were in response to a question by moderator Michael McElroy, a political correspondent at Cardinal & Pine, the North Carolina online publication that hosted the event for the purpose of “supporting North Carolina’s veterans and military families.”
 Big VA cuts spark big worries

The comments came amid concerns about steep staffing cuts at Veterans Administration hospitals. VA staff and supporters contend proposed cuts will hinder the ability to adequately care for veterans. More than 80,000 positions — just over 17% of the roughly 470,000 people it employs — could be eliminated as part of a major restructuring of the federal government’s second largest department.
The Trump administration is thinking about numbers and not people when it proposes such deep cuts to the VA, said Ann Marie Patterson-Powell, a VA nurse.
“They’re not looking at the human side of it. Patterson-Powell said. “We promised those who signed up and left their families, their homes — everything behind — to serve the country. We said, ‘If you do this for me, we’re going to take care of you when you come back.’”
The nation must do for veterans what it said it would do with “no strings attached, with no arguments, with no pushback,” Patterson-Powell said.
(U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Press Secretary Pete Kasperowicz defended the Trump administration’s planned staffing cuts, saying, “We’re going to maintain VA’s mission-essential jobs like doctors, nurses and claims processors, while phasing out non-mission essential roles like DEI officers.”)
Dr. Kyle Horton, founder of On Your Side Health, a nonprofit that addresses health care disparities and works to improve veterans’ care, said the nation has a sacred obligation to protect those who serve.
“Those who wrote a blank check in service to this country with their lives do not deserve to be penny-pinched by Washington bureaucrats,” Horton said.
Horton added: “They don’t deserve to be penny-pinched by Captain Bone Spurs in the White House [a reference to President Donald Trump, who obtained a medical excuse from serving in the Vietnam War due to bone spurs] right now and they don’t deserve to be penny pinched by DOGE [the so-called Department of Government Efficiency] and  [Elon] Musk who don’t even know what they’re doing. Period.”
Patterson-Powell said there is a push by the Trump administration to privatize the VA. That could be harmful to veterans who wouldn’t receive the specialized care they now get at the VA, she said.

The proposed budget VA budget cuts could make people think twice about making a commitment to serve, Peoples said.
“How we take care of them after service is kind of our Number One recruiting tool as well for future people who want to join the military,” Peoples said.
He said the Trump administration’s firing of VA staff members made him angry.
“Every single one of those people got into it for the right reasons; wants to serve their country by taking care of our veterans and the way they have so inhumanely shrugged off cutting people with no transparency, just people receiving emails, people having moved their families across country [to work at the VA], is just despicable,” Peoples said.

Grier Martin, Secretary of the NC Department of Military and Veterans Affairs, said the cuts would have a devastating impact on rural communities.
“If these cuts go through, you’re going to see the VA’s presence in rural areas start to dry out,” Martin said. “These are areas that are already starting to see their civilian hospitals close also.”
The state’s decision to expand Medicaid has been helpful in helping some rural hospitals remain open, he said, but veterans will have difficulty finding care near home if the VA’s presence is diminished.
“If you live on the coast, you’re not going to drive to Durham and you’re probably not going to drive to Fayetteville to the VA hospital to get your care,” Grier said.
Rep. Eric Ager (D-Buncombe) said the outpouring of concern and support for veterans gives him cause for hope amid threats of major cuts to the VA.
“That is how change happens,” Ager said. “It may not be immediate. It may not always be completely satisfying. But the fact that veterans are coming together, that the community is coming together to support veterans, I think will eventually lead to change.”   
 Threats to democracy

A second panel discussion moderated by Cardinal & Pine’s managing editor Billy Ball, focused on threats to democracy and the evolving role of veterans as defenders of democracy.
  Bobby Jones (Screenshot from event video stream)
Panelist Bobby Jones, president of VFRL and retired Navy commander, said he could see the cost of freedom in the faces of the veterans in the audience. Jones said the services the VA provides are essential to national security.
“I know this panel is about national security, but my thing is you cannot have one without the other,” Jones said. “The VA has to be sound in order for us to have a proper national security apparatus.”
Jones was critical of Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. He said neither man understands the concept of service to country.
“For the first time, I believe in American history, we have leadership that doesn’t get it, that thinks the Constitution is nothing more than a suggestion,” Jones said. “Hell, even the South for the Civil War had the good sense to defect and secede before going against the Constitution.”
America is in “unparalleled, unprecedented times” and veterans must step up to lead the country out the quagmire, Jones said.
Ball asked the panel to discuss the much-watched North Carolina Supreme Court race between Republican Jefferson Griffin and Allison Riggs, a Democrat. The outcome of the closely contested race wasn’t resolved until this month after nearly six months. Griffin conceded after a federal judge ordered the state to certify Riggs’ election victory.
Military and overseas votes were at the center of the election dispute. Griffin challenged the validity of some military and overseas absentee ballots in the 2024 contest.
“To protect military and veterans’ families’ votes, really has to come from the voters, really has to come from political pressure,” said Sean Wright, a former Army medic. “We have to make it, as voters, unacceptable to take away the right to vote.”
Rep. Terry Brown (D-Mecklenburg) said men and women who serve overseas have expectations that they will be treated with a certain amount of respect.
“This election really showed how little the powers that be cared about that,” Brown said. “I like to think about it in terms of people that talk a good game, but they don’t back it up.”
Brown said Americans can’t afford to take a day off defending democracy.
“We have to make sure that’s it’s not just doing election season, it’s not just when there are votes on the line, it’s not just when a bad thing happens,” Brown said. “It’s all the time that we’re making sure that y’all are laser-focused on protecting against threats to our democracy.”
Jay Carey, leader of Resist & Persist, a nonpartisan veterans advocacy organization, said the challenge to the state Supreme Court election was a test by the GOP to determine how much the judicial system and voters could stomach.
Carey, who garnered national attention after he was escorted out of U.S. Rep. Chuck Edwards’ townhall meeting in Asheville in March, said there will be more challenges to valid election victories.
“They’re [the challenges] are going to get more and more ridiculous,” Carey said. “It’s going to tie up time and waste more money. Like I said, it was a test. They just wanted to see what they could do.”
The discussion turned to talk of Trump’s removing the military’s Judge Advocate Generals (JAG) and replacing them with what some panelists said are loyalists to the administration. JAGs advise commanders on legal matters and oversee the military judicial system.
Jones said the legal protections provided by JAGs are critical to defending the nation against internal threats he fears are coming from the Trump administration.
“I can’t stress the panic level enough on this,” Jones said. “All of the dominoes are falling. To those of us paying attention, it’s blatantly obvious. Any time there’s a voice of dissent, they shut it down.”

,Mississippi Today,2025-05-25 11:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,It’s time for lawmakers to do Mississippi taxpayers a solid in the special session,Bobby Harrison,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/05/25/its-time-for-lawmakers-to-do-mississippi-taxpayers-a-solid-in-the-special-session/,Column: It will cost Mississippi taxpayers more for a special session than it would have cost them had lawmakers finished their work on time earlier this year. Here's how they can make it up to us.,"In early April, the Mississippi Legislature opted to end the 2025 session and come back in special session, at greater expense to taxpayers, to pass a budget for the upcoming fiscal year that begins July 1.
It will cost Mississippi taxpayers more for a special session than it would have cost them had legislators just voted to remain in regular session to work on the budget. They could have remained in regular session without actually being in Jackson until an agreement between legislative leaders was reached on a budget. At that point, members could have come back to Jackson to vote on the budget, and the additional expenses would have been nominal.
In special session, legislators receive the same expense reimbursements they receive in regular session. In addition, however, the 175 members (including the lieutenant governor) will receive an additional $75 per day.
It is worth noting that legislators receive $1,500 per month when out of session. If they had voted to remain in regular session, they would not have received the $1,500 for April and the $1,500 for May.
Granted, in a representative democracy, making laws can be messy and disagreements occur that lead to added expenses. Those additional expenses can be the cost of living in this country. After all, Russia does not have to worry about additional expenses for lawmakers because of disagreements with Vladimir Putin.
And this is not intended as an argument that Mississippi legislators receive too much money. After all, they have not received a pay raise since 1997 except for increases in their daily per diem when in session for living expenses. The per diem is tied to the federal rate.
But this is simply to point out that legislators had a choice to make back in April: stay in regular session for less money or come back in for a more costly special session.
Since at this point there is no escaping the added expenses for the Legislature being in special session, there are a few extra steps lawmakers could take to give the taxpayers something more for their money.
First of all, when they come back, they should work as quickly and efficiently as possible. Presumably, legislative leaders have been working behind the scenes to reach a budget accord. So, when the governor calls the special session and legislators return to the Capitol, they should be ready and rearing to go.
Second, pass a responsible budget that takes care of the people of the state and not the special interest of any particular legislator or group of legislators.
And finally — and this is an important one — be transparent. The final passage of the state budget normally occurs in the waning hours of the regular session and in one big blur. Transparency is almost never a focus.
The budget is passed piecemeal in more than 100 individual bills. And while this has not always been the case, in recent years often there has not been a readily available document that provides information so that it can be ascertained whether agencies are receiving more or less funding and how the funding the agencies are receiving is being divvied up.
Many legislators often do not actually know what they are voting on when passing the budget in the fog of the end of the regular session.
Legislative leaders, during their out-of-session negotiations, should have had plenty of time to have staff develop such documents, which used to be provided as part of the normal budgeting process.
It could be argued that legislators like the whirlwind process and the lack of transparency because that is how things like funds for work on golf courses or work on obscure streets are sneaked into budget bills while other major needs are neglected.
But since the Legislature has been able to work behind the scenes on a budget for almost two months now, there is no excuse for the lack of transparency.
After all, taxpayers should be getting something for their money. So come on, legislators, it is time to do the taxpayers a solid.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/10091749/Legislative-Session-2025-10.jpg,,,2025-05-25 08:00:23.919638

This Memorial Day, Marlboro is mourning the loss of Richard Henry Hamilton, a former prisoner of war turned community cornerstone who died recently at age 102.

Eighty years later, his hometown is saying goodbye..","The gravestone of Richard Hamilton and his wife, Joyce, at Marlboro’s King Cemetery. Photo by Kevin O’Connor/VTDiggerMARLBORO — As a longtime volunteer and chair of the town’s new cemetery commission, Marcia Hamilton annually prepares for Memorial Day by helping place American flags at the graves of local soldiers. This year, that tradition hit especially close to home with the latest addition to the list: The 102-year-old World War II hero she knew as Dad.Richard Henry Hamilton was born to nearby Brattleboro farmers on Sept. 28, 1922. The family didn’t plug into electricity until after he graduated from high school in 1940, which is why all were huddled around a battery-powered radio when President Franklin D. Roosevelt called for war after Japan attacked Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941.“Listening to that, we didn’t know where Pearl Harbor was,” Richard recalled in a 2015 National WWII Museum interview, Drafted in 1942, the young Vermonter joined the Army Air Corps. He was serving as a radio operator and gunner on a B-17 bomber named “Destiny’s Child” when it flew over Germany on July 20, 1944.Vermont television station WCAX profiled Richard Hamilton for its “Super Senior” series in 2018. Photo by Joe Carroll/WCAX“When dots were spotted way back, we assumed that was our escort,” Richard said.Instead, the speeding specks were 60 enemy fighters that shot a wing off his plane. Richard saw bullets and a resulting blaze kill four crewmen before he and four others parachuted down 18,000 feet. Separated from his fellow soldiers, he soon found himself in a wheat field.“The whole village seemed to turn out — with their clubs and pitchforks,” he recalled in a 2008 Library of Congress interview. “I don’t speak German, but I was introduced to it very suddenly.” Richard landed in the Stalag Luft IV prisoner-of-war camp. Jailed for 10 months, he was forced out on Feb. 6, 1945, for a multiweek death march.“Day after day we were just on the road,” he said. “There was no destination.”It instead led to dysentery, frostbite, blisters, body lice and jaundice. “My feet were black and blue and infected,” he said of his 76th day. “I came to a decision that I wasn’t going to go anymore.”Miraculously, that’s when two Allied soldiers liberated him on April 24, 1945.“When we saw the Statue of Liberty, I could just sense how those immigrants placed all their hopes and dreams in that,” he said of his return home.Richard Hamilton stands second from the left in the back row for this World War II photo of the “Destiny’s Child” B-17 bomber and crew. Photo from the 91st Bomb GroupBack in Vermont, Richard married his sweetheart Joyce White and moved to Marlboro, a southeastern Vermont town known for its former namesake college and longtime music festival. There, they acquired the Skyline restaurant, which the couple ran atop Hogback Mountain until retiring almost 50 years later in 1994.Ever busy, Richard also served on the town select and school boards and as a constable, tax collector and justice of the peace. He wound the clock in the Meeting House steeple until his hip was replaced at age 90. He commanded the Vermont chapter of American Ex-Prisoners of War, and after drawing faith by memorizing Psalm 91 during his capture (its line “He is my refuge and my fortress” appears on his gravestone), he helped Gideons International distribute Bibles to hotels, schools and prisons.Richard died at home on Feb. 19 at age 102, leaving four daughters, seven grandchildren and 14 great-grandchildren.“He was still active” attending men’s breakfasts, senior lunches and veterans’ dinners, his obituary said.Marlboro residents were still thinking about him two weeks later when they voted to create a local cemetery commission.A tree grows in Marlboro’s Center Cemetery. Photo by Kevin O’Connor/VTDiggerAccording to state law, municipal gravesites are the responsibility of a town selectboard or city council unless a community “votes to place its public burial grounds under the charge of cemetery commissioners.”Marlboro approved Vermont’s newest such commission in a 308-22 vote March 4, electing Marcia Hamilton and fellow volunteers Hollis Burbank-Hammarlund and Sally White to its three seats. They’re now working on spring cleanup, summer mowing, year-round green options and “a user-friendly flowchart to help the public navigate the burial process,” according to meeting minutes.“One thing we plan to do is create a policy to standardize the care each cemetery gets,” Marcia said of the group, which has a $16,200 annual budget. “We’re trying to show that a commission is a good idea by not having a spurt of expenditures. It’s not going to cost any more money than it ever has.”Marcia and her family received help at her father’s graveside service May 14 at King Cemetery. More than 200 friends, neighbors, veterans and first responders assisted with a 21-gun salute, the playing of taps and a U.S. Air Force flyover.Shortly after, Marcia followed in the footsteps of her late mother by gathering three generations of her family to place American flags at the burial plots of local soldiers. She started with her father and went as far back as Revolutionary War militiaman Elijah Bruce, who is believed to have fought at the Battle of Bennington in 1777 before dying from smallpox in 1835.Each stone, she knows, has its own story.Read the story on VTDigger here:  A Vermont WWII veteran survived a death march.

But the real number of times educators put students in holds, move them against their will and shut them alone in small rooms is likely much higher.
Restraint and seclusion are widely condemned practices that create lasting trauma for students, their families and the educators involved. That’s why every use is supposed to be documented and reported to the state. But over the past decade, only 24 out of more than 250 private schools and public districts in Maine have consistently reported their numbers.

Maine law mandates annual reporting to the Maine Department of Education, however the department did not say whether there was any penalty for failing to report.
Maine law mandates annual reporting to the Maine Department of Education. However, according to Bear Shea, the department’s restraint and seclusion specialist, Maine DOE “has not been given statutory authority or mechanisms to enforce compliance.”
Rather, the department seems to operate under the assumption that a district’s lack of reporting means schools didn’t restrain or seclude any students that year.
“It is possible that if a school district does not have any incidents of restraint and seclusion in a school year, they will not report any data,” said Chloe Teboe, the department spokesperson, when asked about the dozens of districts that aren’t reporting every year, according to publicly available state data. “The Maine DOE can only act on the data that is shared by school districts, as required by statute.”
Atlee Reilly, managing attorney for the advocacy organization Disability Rights Maine, said it’s “beyond unlikely” that districts failing to report have not used restraint or seclusion.
Overall, reporting to the DOE has fallen off in recent years, Reilly told lawmakers on May 9 during discussion of a proposed bill that aims to relax the rules on restraint and seclusion. Many of the state’s largest districts and schools that historically reported frequent use of restraint and seclusion have stopped sharing their numbers in recent years, according to statewide data.
“I know that some schools that have historically reported high numbers of restraints haven’t reported,” Reilly said. “So does that mean that they, all of a sudden, are not restraining or secluding youth? I think probably not.”
At least one school not reporting high use to state
A closer look at the Bangor Regional Program, a school for students with disabilities, reveals how restraint and seclusion practices can go unreported for years.
Bangor Public Schools is responsible for reporting its own numbers, as well as the data for the Bangor Regional Program, which serves students from several area districts. The state database includes numbers from the regional program for one of the past 10 years, after a 2019 investigation found the school had been restraining and secluding students thousands of times each year from 2015 to 2018, more than almost any other school in the state.
During the 2019-20 school year, the regional program used 261 restraints and 325 seclusions on 33 individual students. Internal data provided by Bangor schools to Maine Morning Star in response to a records request shows that in the following years, the program continued using these practices. In 2021-22, the school reported 419 total uses of restraint and seclusion. In 2022-23, use dropped to 187, and in 2023-24, increased to 281.
None of these incidents were reported to the state, according to publicly available state data.
Though Bangor Public Schools reports its data every year, when asked why the regional program’s numbers were not shared with the state, spokesperson Ray Phinney said he didn’t know and couldn’t find out due to recent changes in district leadership.
“The superintendent who oversaw the submission of this is no longer with us,” he said.
The DOE did not respond directly to questions about this school’s lack of reporting, but the spokesperson said the department “reports any data received from school districts and does not make a practice of not publishing it.”
Ben Jones, director of legal and policy initiatives for Lives in the Balance, a Maine-based nonprofit that works with schools to reduce restraint and seclusion, said it’s important for the department to explain what happens when schools like the regional program collect data but don’t report it to the state.
“We still don’t have a true sense of the scope of using these dangerous practices, so this, to me, points the spotlight back at reporting and collecting,” he said. “So what more is DOE doing to ensure the completeness of the data, the completeness of this picture?”
Few districts regularly report data
This underreporting casts doubt on the apparent progress Maine has made in relying less on these practices in the wake of a 2021 law, which specified restraint and seclusion should only be used in emergency situations.
The law was intended to reduce the use of emergency behavioral interventions that are known to be traumatic — particularly for students with disabilities, who are disproportionately affected.
“It’s very difficult to tell if the numbers went down or up after the law change because of underreporting,” Jones said.
In the 2022-23 school year, Maine schools reported 44% fewer incidents of restraint and seclusion in schools than it did four years earlier. But only 140 of Maine’s 300-plus school administrative units submitted their data for that school year. In 2018-19, that number was 213.










I don't want anyone to think that people in schools are just wanting to put hands on kids. Because it's traumatic, it's not good. However, there are times, when for the safety of an individual student or others around that individual, it becomes necessary to restrain or seclude.


–  Superintendent Clay Gleason, Maine School Administrative District 6


Only 24 districts have submitted restraint and seclusion data every year for the last decade, a Maine Morning Star analysis found.
Together, they represent fewer than one-quarter of Maine’s roughly 170,000 K-12 students. Only two of the state’s 10 largest districts, Bangor and Maine School Administrative District (MSAD) 6 in the Buxton area, are among them.
In the 2018-19 school year, MSAD 6 staff reported restraining students 150 times and placing them in rooms by themselves 256 times.
By 2022-23, MSAD 6’s use of those tactics, especially seclusions, had dropped considerably. District staff that year reported restraining students 100 times and placing them in seclusion rooms 132 times.
That district’s reliance on restraint and seclusion roughly matches the trend statewide over that period. Across Maine, use of restraint and seclusion peaked in the 2018-19 year at more than 22,000 reported uses, according to the available state data. After passage of the 2021 law restricting their use to instances when a student’s behavior poses an “imminent danger” of serious injury, overall incidents fell to just under 12,600 in the 2022-23 school year — a 44% drop.
“I don’t want anyone to think that people in schools are just wanting to put hands on kids. Because it’s traumatic, it’s not good,” said MSAD 6 Superintendent Clay Gleason. “However, there are times, when for the safety of an individual student or others around that individual, it becomes necessary to restrain or seclude.”

Numbers still high despite underreporting
Despite inconsistent reporting, it’s clear many Maine districts still rely on these practices thousands of times a year. In 2021, data reported directly by schools to the federal government showed that Maine ranked first and second in restraining and secluding students, respectively, per capita. According to an analysis of the most recent national numbers, the state fell to third and fourth per capita.
“These are still extremely high numbers,” said Jones with Lives in the Balance. “Each one of these is a kid being grabbed or put into a closet, and then there’s probably more of it going on based on what we know.”
The number of reported restraints and seclusions vary widely from district to district, noted Alan Cobo-Lewis, director of the Center for Community Inclusion and Disability Studies and associate professor of Psychology at the University of Maine.
Some districts have reported zero incidents for many years, and others like those in the Buxton-area, report large numbers. But “whether they’re model programs, or whether they’re just not reporting their restraints, I don’t think that you can know that without actually visiting schools,” Cobo-Lewis said.
“I have advocated for a while for the department to visit the schools that had high rates and also visit the schools that had zero,” he said.
While the federal government collects this data from districts, there is no federal oversight, and every state has different laws about restraint and seclusion. Some members of Congress have proposed a federal ban on school use of restraint and seclusion, with the most recent legislation introduced in 2023.
The proposal currently before Maine lawmakers would allow districts to move students against their will without reporting it as a restraint and would allow educators more flexibility in determining when they use these practices by decreasing the level of danger posed by a student’s behavior from “serious physical injury” to just “injury.”
Both Jones and Reilly of Disability Rights Maine worry that if the bill passes, schools will no longer have to report incidents where staff move students against their will into classrooms and quiet rooms. That would mean the statewide data on the number of restraints could drop.
“What we’re going to do is take a whole class of stuff — like the physical management of students that I think most people would look at and say, that child’s being restrained — and say it’s no longer restraint,” Reilly said.
He added, “It doesn’t mean that people are going to be putting their hands on kids less.”
From 2014 to 2023, school units reported 55 serious bodily injuries to students and 594 to staff members related to the use of a restraint or seclusion, according to publicly available data. In recent years, the number of students injured while being restrained and secluded has increased, with 22 of those 55 instances reported in the 2022-23 school year, all reported by Biddeford Schools. The southern coastal district did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
Most years, the vast majority of districts reported zero injuries.
MSAD 6 in Buxton is one of the only districts that has reported staff and student injuries to the department every year, but Gleason said he did not recall any serious incidents, and did not know what criteria was used by staff who filled out forms.
“There are minor injuries that happen to both staff and students, sometimes with somebody getting a little rug burn or bumping into a desk or something,” he said, explaining the typical ways staff or students might get injured during a restraint or seclusion.
“But I don’t know if it’s a standard kind of thing across districts and how they report it, or if it’s like an internal measure,” he added.
According to state law, school units would not report injuries that do not meet the definition of serious physical injury, according to Shea, the department’s restraint and seclusion specialist. But in practice, “I have talked with many schools and there is a wide range of ways that [school administrative units] choose to report injuries with some tending to report even more minor injuries,” he said.
While the department collects injury data, there is no statewide policy about what districts should do in response to student or staff injuries.
Majority of reports from schools for students with disabilities
When public school districts determine they can’t adequately serve a student with disabilities, some of them are referred to special purpose private schools. Although these schools still receive public funding, Jones said the programs are often insulated from scrutiny.
Having sat through dozens of those placement meetings, Jones said the student’s parents and advocates are hoping that a move would increase support for the child, but that’s not always the case.
Pointing to the high number of reported incidents, Jones said these schools can often be “hotbeds for the inappropriate use of restraint and seclusion.”
Over the past decade, Maine’s special purpose private schools have accounted for roughly 57% of all uses of restraint and seclusion in the state each year, going up to almost 70% in 2019-20, when the state saw the most incidents in a decade.
Though the data from these schools haven’t been consistently included in the state’s annual data, students with disabilities in Maine and nationwide are much more likely to be subject to these practices.
Maine’s special purpose private schools served roughly 850 students in 2022-23 but accounted for 58% of all 7,975 restraints in the state, according to a Maine Morning Star analysis. That same year, they also accounted for about 47% of all seclusions in Maine: 2,154 of 4,618 incidents.
The Margaret Murphy Centers for Children, a special purpose private school with campuses in Auburn, Lewiston, Saco and Turner, has topped the state’s list for seclusion every year since 2014-15; it has also restrained students more than any other school every year since 2017-18, state data shows.
The centers used these practices more than 11,000 times on just 108 students in 2019-20, according to the state data from 2023.
There is no state law restricting an educator from using these practices repeatedly on a particular child. And unless a parent complains and requests a district try a new approach, there is no statewide process for addressing the frequency of incidents.

Margaret Murphy Senior Director Michelle Hathaway attributed those numbers to the severity of the student population’s needs. The school exclusively serves children and young adults (up to age 22) with significant behavioral and developmental challenges, many of whom are referred to the school specifically because of the “intensity or dangerousness of their behaviors,” she said.
They sometimes display aggression — including attempts to hit, choke, or rip out hair — that can pose serious safety risks to themselves or others.
Hathaway wrote in an email that restraints are only used as a “last resort” but argued the law leaves room for interpretation and that ambiguity means some schools may “over-document and over-report.”
For example, she said a staff member holding a 3-year-old’s hand to prevent them from running into a parking lot could technically, under current law, be considered a restraint.
But repeatedly using restraint and seclusion on a small number of students should be a red flag that something is not working, Jones said.
“Of course emergency situations will arise, but after the first few uses of restraint or seclusion, we are no longer talking about emergencies,” he said. “We are talking about predictable behavior that can be planned for, trained for.”

People with intellectual or developmental disabilities have suffered abuse, neglect and even death while under the care of private equity-owned providers, according to a recent report from watchdog group Private Equity Stakeholder Project.
“Private equity firms are, more than many other types of investors, laser-focused on maximizing their cash flow, often trying to double or triple their investment over a relatively short period of time, usually just a handful of years,” said Eileen O’Grady, the report’s author. “The way that private equity firms will often do that is to cut costs.”
For companies that provide essential services for people with disabilities, she said, “those cuts can have really harmful impacts on people’s lives.”
In late 2023, Florida moved to revoke the license of NeuroRestorative, one branch of the private equity-owned health services company Sevita, which provides services for people with disabilities. State regulators cited repeat violations by NeuroRestorative and a failure to “protect the rights of its clients to be free from physical abuse.” Ultimately the state opted not to revoke the license and fined the company $13,000 in a settlement.
But in recent years regulators have documented instances of patient harm at Sevita’s affiliates in multiple other states, including Colorado, Indiana, Iowa, Massachusetts and Utah. In 2019, a U.S. Senate committee conducted a probe into the company’s operations in Iowa and Oregon following multiple reports of patient abuse and neglect.
“Any entity that receives taxpayer dollars, but especially those charged with caring for our fellow Americans who may have an intellectual disability, ought to be doing everything under the sun to ensure quality care and continually improve,” U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, said in a statement in 2020 following his investigation.
In a statement to Stateline, Sevita did not address the sanctions directly, but avowed its commitment to providing services and supports to give people greater independence, regardless of their intellectual or physical challenges.
“Since 2019, when new ownership acquired the company, there has been significant capital investment to improve and expand our services, enhance facilities, implement robust training and new technologies, and strengthen our workforce — all with the goal of better serving our individuals and communities,” the statement said.
The disability care industry has proven increasingly attractive to private equity.
In recent years, a handful of large private equity-owned companies such as Sevita have snapped up hundreds of smaller providers of disability services — often community nonprofits, mom-and-pop businesses and religious organizations — and rolled them into larger corporations.
From 2013 to 2023, private equity firms acquired more than 1,000 disability and elder care providers, according to the report by the Private Equity Stakeholder Project. That’s likely an undercount because they’re generally not required to disclose acquisitions, the report said.
 Cash cow

Private equity firms use pooled investments from pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, endowments and wealthy individuals to buy a controlling stake in a company. They seek to maximize its value — often by cutting costs — and then sell it at a profit.
Most of Sevita’s revenue comes from providing disability services. It operates companies in 40 states under various brands, including Mentor Network, NeuroRestorative and REM.
Sevita is currently owned by private equity firms Centerbridge Partners and Vistria Group, which also own Help at Home, a home health company with more than 200 locations across about a dozen states.
Nearly all of Sevita’s revenue comes from Medicaid, according to a February 2025 report from S&P Global.
Through Medicaid and Medicare, the government pays for most services for people with intellectual or developmental disabilities. The two programs cover services such as group homes, adult day programs, in-home care, and physical and occupational therapy.
Abortion providers challenge FDA’s remaining mifepristone restrictions in federal court

“Sevita has been owned by private equity firms for over a decade now, and has been under investigation and scrutiny at the federal and state level for basically that entire time,” O’Grady said.
In 2022, Iowa fined a NeuroRestorative group home $10,500 after a resident was left unattended in a liquor store and drank three-quarters of a bottle of vodka. The same year, Massachusetts temporarily removed Sevita’s license to operate group homes after regulators reported inadequate staff training and supervision, and a “myriad of issues that were uncovered onsite,” according to a Massachusetts Department of Developmental Services report.
The federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has fined a NeuroRestorative facility in Utah four times since 2022. A February 2024 inspection report by the agency found the facility “failed to prevent abuse, neglect … and exploitation” of residents.
Last year, Florida fined another Sevita brand, Florida Mentor, for improper use of restraints. More issues have been documented in Sevita-owned locations in Arkansas, California, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, New Hampshire and Nevada.
Meanwhile, Sevita’s owners, Centerbridge and Vistria, have collected nearly half a billion dollars since 2019 by loading Sevita and Help at Home with debt in order to pay dividends to investors, according to Moody’s, a financial services company.
Similar financial maneuvering contributed to the recent collapse of Steward Health Care, a private equity-owned hospital system that once had more than 30 hospitals nationwide. Steward has become a cautionary tale about the harm that profit-driven private equity firms can do to a state’s health system.
“Before Steward Health Care ultimately collapsed, executives spent years hiding their financial information from state regulators, putting patients and our health care system at risk,” Massachusetts Democratic House Speaker Ron Mariano said in a statement earlier this year announcing a new state law that beefs up reporting and financial requirements for private investors.
“That’s why ensuring that our institutions are equipped to monitor the health care landscape, and to guard against trends and transactions that drive up costs without improving patient outcomes, is so important.”
 David vs. Goliath

After two residents of a New Jersey group home died from choking on food in 2017, attorney Cory Bernstein became interested in private equity’s involvement in disability services. The residents had been living in homes operated by AdvoServ, a company then owned by the private equity firm Wellspring Capital Management. The state had cited AdvoServ more times than any other operator in New Jersey for abuse, neglect and unsafe conditions.
AdvoServ later ceased operations in 2019 after multiple state agencies, including in New Jersey, Florida and Maryland, launched investigations.
But even when state regulators are doing all they can to protect people with disabilities from substandard care, they’re limited in how much they can hold a company accountable, Bernstein told Stateline.
“It’s state-level oversight on a national entity with not much [help] coming from the federal side,” said Bernstein, who is now a staff attorney at the National Disability Rights Network, a membership organization of federally mandated state disability advocacy programs.
“States just don’t really have the resources or tools to do what needs to be done.”
‘It is a fight’: Patients, OB-GYNs and sexual health advocates determined to stop Medicaid cuts

A regulatory agency in Georgia might shut down all the group homes owned by a certain company, for example, but those regulators can’t do anything about the company’s abuses in, say, Montana. With branches in multiple states, a company is better able to withstand sanctions or even a loss of license in one state, he said.
“[States] are not set up to go up against a national operator with billions of dollars in resources in a regulatory or oversight battle,” Bernstein said.
Further complicating things for state regulators and for consumers is that a large services company such as Sevita might operate under multiple brand names, even in one state. It can be hard to parse out who owns a sanctioned business. Multiple brand names can also obscure a company’s monopoly on a particular regional market.
When Florida regulators reached a settlement agreement with Sevita’s NeuroRestorative last year, the state dismissed its proposed license revocation. O’Grady believes one reason the state chose to settle is the difficulty of finding alternative facilities to relocate the residents who would have been displaced from the 13 locations the company operated around the state.
“Because of that dearth of alternatives and the impotence of the state to act more fully, this company will continue to be allowed to operate,” she said.
Further complicating oversight: Large companies often operate various services that are overseen by different agencies. Group homes might be regulated under the state’s Medicaid program, while facilities that provide more intensive care might come under federal Medicare oversight.
There could be “two completely different oversight systems for facilities serving the same population in the same state with the same name,” Bernstein said.
 State solutions

Some states have moved to address problems with private equity involvement in health care by passing tighter restrictions on mergers and acquisitions of health care companies.
In Rhode Island, where private equity companies’ mismanagement of health care providers threatened the future of local hospitals, a robust oversight law allowed the state attorney general to impose conditions to protect the hospitals’ finances.
More states are following suit. In 2023 alone, 24 states enacted laws related to health system consolidation and competition, while this year at least half a dozen have considered legislation to check private equity-fueled health care mergers.

But during the 2023-24 school year at Ellsworth Elementary-Middle School, that’s what happened — at least 18 times, according to Emerson and school district incident reports reviewed by the Maine Morning Star. Staff members put the 7-year-old boy in holds, forced him into empty rooms and did not let him out until he calmed down or his parents picked him up.
“It broke him, and it broke me,” Emerson said.
The trauma became so severe that her son, now a third grader, no longer attends school in person, she said.
What happened to Emerson’s son is not an isolated case. Across Maine, schools use restraint and seclusion on students more than 10,000 times each year, according to Maine Department of Education data — with some districts resorting to the emergency tactics regularly while others have changed policies and taken other steps so that such interventions are only used as a last resort.

​In recent years, Maine as a whole has made an effort to reduce restraint and seclusion in schools, particularly for students with disabilities, with the U.S. Department of Education citing staff and student injuries and the resulting trauma for students as the reasons to curtail their use. The department has also condemned and discouraged these practices for years under multiple presidential administrations. Rare cases have resulted in serious injuries to students and even death.
A 2021 state law limits restraint and seclusion to emergencies. But as Maine educators report more challenging student behavior in the years since pandemic school closures, there have been calls to allow school staff to restrain and seclude children more often. A newly proposed bill would broaden the circumstances under which school staff could restrain or seclude students, igniting debate among educators, parents and lawmakers about how to manage student behavior without inflicting harm.
The Maine Education Association and the Maine School Management Association, representing teachers and administrators statewide, both support the proposal, citing increased reports of disruptive and violent student behavior — something educators nationwide have also reported in recent years.
The Gardiner-area school system, Maine School Administrative District (MSAD) 11, has led the push for that proposal. Victoria Duguay, principal of River View Community School in Gardiner, and MSAD 11 Superintendent Patricia Hopkins shared stories with lawmakers of students who hit and spit at adults, scream in hallways, throw chairs and destroy other students’ schoolwork.
Under the 2021 state law, school staff can only restrain students (immobilize them and move them against their will) or seclude them (isolate them in a room that they can’t leave) if their behavior “poses an imminent danger of serious physical injury” — requiring medical intervention beyond first aid, according to the Maine Department of Education regulations that govern restraint and seclusion.
“Staff are being hit, they’re being bit, but it doesn’t meet the threshold of serious imminent danger, because a 5-year-old isn’t going to [cause] an injury that requires medical care,” Hopkins said during an April 23 public hearing.
This extreme behavior, when it happens in a public place at school, traumatizes other students who witness it, Duguay said. The school sometimes has to close off access to common spaces — the gym or cafeteria — if a student acts out in a hallway through which students would need to pass.
Under the legislation MSAD 11 is supporting, staff would be able to move students against their will to a seclusion room or another quiet space without it counting as a restraint, which districts have to record, document, and report to the state.
But some educators who have pursued alternative training don’t agree that loosening restraint and seclusion requirements is the answer.
“The consequences of passing this bill will only inflict more trauma on students,” said Audrey Bartholomew, associate professor and coordinator of special education programs at the University of New England, who trains special education teachers. “Additionally, the behavior will keep happening, because restraint and seclusion is not an appropriate response to challenging behavior, and it will in no way help students remediate their behavior. These should not be referred to as strategies, treatments or solutions.”
Inside the three-hour restraint and seclusion of a 7-year-old
In October 2023, Emerson’s son started a behavior plan to help with concentration and self-regulation. The plan, which Emerson shared with the Maine Morning Star, highlighted the mother’s concerns about her son’s anger, dysregulation, anxiety and ADHD, and noted Emerson’s finding that occupational therapy had helped her son better regulate.
One week after the plan was put into place, the boy arrived at Ellsworth Elementary-Middle School already agitated, hit another student with a Pete the Cat stuffed animal and tried to leave the classroom, setting off a series of escalating interventions in which staff physically restrained him, relocated him against his will, and ultimately placed him in a small room where he stayed until his father arrived, according to incident reports shared with the Maine Morning Star.
The reports, which staff or administrators are required to write, offer an inside look at the behavior leading up to the restraint, how the situation escalated as staff restrained and secluded the boy, and how it continued for three hours, ending when Seth Emerson picked his son up from a seclusion room.
When the second grader initially tried to leave his classroom, two educators cornered the boy in a hallway nook, according to the report written by the school’s assistant principal. When he tried to push past them, they placed a mat between themselves and the child to block him from hitting them, and initiated the first of several physical holds. Each time he was released, he briefly calmed down but didn’t follow directions to sit still or stay in a designated spot, prompting a cycle: he would attempt to flee, staff would block him, the boy would resist, and staff would restrain him again, the report says.
About an hour in, while hiding in a locker, he asked to go home. A staff member moved him to a classroom, where he hid under a desk, retrieved rocks from his backpack, and threw them at staff, the report said. While the report described the projectiles as rocks, Emerson said her son had pebbles in his backpack.
Two hours in, staff called his parents. Even after he calmed down, they placed him in a seclusion room — referred to as a “quiet room” in the report — where they continued telling him to sit in a specific spot. When his father arrived, the boy walked out on his own, calm and cooperative.
Incidents like that continued for several more months for reasons that Emerson said did not warrant these measures: After he pulled books off shelves, punched a door, or refused to accompany staff to a quiet room, staff would put him in a physical hold or placed him in a room alone, according to a complaint Emerson filed with the district.
“I never condoned any of the behavior, whether he was throwing a book or whether he was yelling or running out of the classroom,” she said. “But he was not getting any education whatsoever last year. He was literally just going to school and being restrained and secluded.”
  Ellsworth Elementary-Middle School, pictured here, is far from the only school restraining and secluding children, practices that Maine law said should be used only in emergency situations.

Frequent seclusions push an educator to quit
It’s not only students and their families who feel the trauma from restraints and seclusion. The educators who are told to put their hands on children feel it, too, several current and former teachers and education technicians told the Maine Morning Star.
Ashley Rose took a job as an ed tech at SeDoMoCha Elementary School in Dover-Foxcroft in August while working toward a degree in special education. But after months of witnessing staff placing students in empty rooms as they screamed and cried to be let out, she changed course.
In March, Rose switched her major, deciding she no longer wanted to become a teacher. On April 28, she resigned, writing to Superintendent Stacy Shorey that she had repeatedly raised concerns with supervisors about the school’s frequent use of seclusion, the lack of staff training on student behavior, and the absence of alternatives — without seeing meaningful change.
SeDoMoCha Elementary School has “quiet rooms” located within special education classrooms — which Rose described as 10-by-6-foot rooms with no windows. Some have benches and one light, while others are entirely empty, she said. All the doors have windows in them so staff can monitor students.
In her 10 years of working in special education, she has never seen such frequent use of quiet rooms, Rose said.
In December, Rose found herself participating in her first seclusion. The student she was working with wasn’t physically aggressive, just loud, and Rose’s plan had been to escort her into the special education classroom — not the quiet room — to help her calm down.
The student went with her voluntarily but was crying, she said. When they got to the classroom, another staff member who had worked at the school longer said it was part of that student’s behavior plan to go to the quiet room.
“That wasn’t my plan,” Rose said. “That room scares me just looking at it as an adult.”
As the student became more agitated, Rose said her own anxiety rose. If the student didn’t calm down, the other employee told Rose she had to shut the door. Rose complied, and then her colleague told her to hold the door shut with her foot to keep the student inside, she said.
Inside the room, the student began having what appeared to be an anxiety attack and threatened to break the window. She calmed down after about 20 minutes, and Rose let her out. Rose said she was not directed to file an incident report, nor was she told if someone else in the district did, despite the requirement in state law that districts document every seclusion.
Over the holiday break that followed, Rose said she had trouble sleeping. “All I can think about is the student I put in that room,” she said. “School should be their safe place, and these students were not feeling safe.”
Shorey, the superintendent, said staff members are required to report every incident, but she did not know about the particular incident Rose described. Special Education Director Sue Terrill said it’s possible that a staff member other than Rose wrote a report, but the district was unable to locate any documentation of that event.
The district trains employees in safety care — crisis management and prevention practices — Terrill said. It is open to other trainings, too, she said, including one that Rose brought to Terrill’s attention in February offered by the Maine nonprofit Lives in the Balance, which other districts have used to dramatically reduce their reliance on restraint and seclusion.
Quiet rooms present a gray area
Rose said she saw staff members keep students in seclusion rooms even when they were calm, using those same rooms for a variety of reasons beyond seclusion, which is banned or strictly regulated in at least seven states, according to the MOST Policy Initiative, a Missouri nonprofit. Maine came close to banning the rooms in 2021, but the final version of the law was amended to allow their use in emergencies.
Rose said she saw staff place students in quiet rooms to calm down after acting out, and then not allow them to exit for 20 minutes after they calmed down. If the seclusion happened at the end of the school day, sometimes the student would be expected to return to the quiet room the next day, she said.
Terrill recalled Rose raising this as an issue but denied keeping students in the rooms after they calmed down and no longer met the legal threshold for confinement.
But the district does use these rooms as timeout spaces, either by student choice or by staff direction, Terrill confirmed. Often, Terrill said, staff members are positioned outside the rooms, as they would be in a seclusion incident, but the student is typically free to leave the room, which is not the case in a seclusion.
Sometimes, the door is open, or a student can choose to shut the door with a staff member standing outside, she said.
“It can be the same room used if the student was in seclusion,” she said. “But if they’re taking a break because of something that happened, and that’s being used as a break space, the student might continue to work in there until they’re ready to go back to the classroom.”
Like RSU 68 in Dover-Foxcroft, districts across Maine also use seclusion rooms as quiet spaces, according to Ben Jones, a former Disability Rights Maine attorney who now works for Lives in the Balance.
“I think it’s actually more the rare case that the school is like, ‘We’re going to build this room and we’re going to call it the seclusion room, and it’s going to be used just for seclusion,’” he said.
If a student has voluntarily shut themselves in the seclusion room with a staff member outside and is free to go at any time, it would not count as seclusion under Maine law, he said. But if staff members ask students to stay in there to complete their work, as Rose described, whether it would count as a seclusion that districts are required to report to the state is “open to interpretation,” Jones said.
“The overall thing is, the kid is not learning, not in the classroom, in something that could easily turn into seclusion,” he said. “It’s inappropriate at best and potentially illegal if it’s an unrecorded seclusion.”
When are students and staff in ‘imminent danger’?
Education technicians like Rose — aides who often work with students one-on-one or in small groups — are often the ones handling student outbursts or potential violence, said Greg Kavanaugh, who spent 13 years working as an ed tech and special education teacher in Biddeford, Portland, and Yarmouth.
Ed techs are among the lowest-paid professionals in education, and often the least trained — including on behavior management techniques.
“They’re having to make good decisions about when to restrain, when to seclude, and their judgment is going to be really hard because they’re so stressed, overwhelmed, underpaid,” Kavanaugh said. “That just leads to more mistakes, more lapses in judgment.”
In his experience, Kavanaugh said, restraint and seclusion were consistently treated as last-resort measures — used only in extreme situations.
Staff received training on managing student behavior, they debriefed after restraints and seclusions, and they held regular conversations with parents, he said, which disability rights advocates recommend as best practices.
But working in a functional life skills program with students with moderate to severe disabilities, Kavanaugh said, deciding whether to restrain or seclude a child was never easy despite clear protocols in place. Even when a student threw a laptop across the room or hit him, he had to determine whether the behavior posed an imminent danger of serious injury that would require medical intervention beyond first aid — the standard in Maine law — and only intervene physically if it did. He also had to keep calm if students hit him, he said, because that still did not meet the legal standard.
Every time he did restrain or seclude a child, it stayed with him long after. He said he often questioned whether it had been the right call, thought about how families would respond, and considered the lasting effects the practice might have on the student — and on himself.
“Anytime there was a hold, a restraint or a seclusion, you’re taking that home, and you’re thinking about that kid when you’re at home, trying to move on with your day,” he said. “I’m a pretty strong-willed person, but there are plenty of times I would quietly be in tears, or going home and having an extra glass of wine, because I’m just not processing it well in the aftermath.”
Other students in the classroom witnessing these incidents are also traumatized, Kavanaugh said.
“You see the terror on their classmates’ faces, and you feel bad for the kid in a certain way because this is going to hurt their relationships,” he said.
But talking to parents afterward would always make him feel better, Kavanaugh said, because parents of students with disabilities are often dealing with similar behavior challenges at home.

District response to a parental complaint
Emerson, the parent in Ellsworth, complained to the school board, Superintendent Amy Boles, and the Maine Department of Education in August 2024, alleging that staff members had not met the legal threshold for using restraint and seclusion so often on her son.
Boles wrote back in October, saying in cases where Emerson’s son was hitting, scratching, and kicking staff, “it is my conclusion that active behavior like this toward another person does create an ‘imminent danger’ that the other person could be sufficiently injured that he or she may need more than ‘routine first aid.’”
“The incident may not in fact have caused an injury requiring that level of care, but a reasonable and prudent person could reasonably conclude that this could occur,” Boles wrote in her letter, reviewed by Maine Morning Star.
But the investigation the district launched in response to Emerson’s complaint found that staff had improperly restrained and secluded her son in at least five of the 18 incidents to which his mother objected. Some incident reports were also vaguely written, Boles wrote, which was the case for the three-hour incident in October 2023 — making it difficult to determine whether restraints and seclusion were warranted.
Nonetheless, Boles concluded in her letter to Emerson that all staff need training on the proper use of restraint and seclusion, and she agreed the district should rely on the practice less often.
Boles declined to comment on the investigation or specific incidents, but said district staff have undergone an initial training with Lives in the Balance, and followup trainings are planned.
“Behavior is an issue across the board. I mean, it’s skyrocketing everywhere. It’s not just Ellsworth,” she said. “But we’re working really hard to try to be preventative before it gets to that extreme state, trying to teach staff day-to-day strategies to prevent the behavior before it escalates.”
Emerson said her son is still visibly shaken every time he passes by the school, or even when someone mentions the word “school” around him.
On April 23, she testified at a public hearing, telling Maine lawmakers restraint and seclusion in public schools must stop. The day before, her son had said he was still afraid to go to school in person.
“His world has become so small since these events, he rarely leaves our home,” she said. “Everyone continues about their day, and yet I’m left to pick up the pieces.”

(Troy Bennett/Maine Morning Star)About a decade ago, a Maine school district became concerned about how often staff members physically restrained students who were acting out and put them in seclusion rooms, especially the district’s 500 or so special education students.
Those tactics are only supposed to be used in emergencies under state law, but at the time, Maine School Administrative District (MSAD) 75 recorded 176 restraints and 152 seclusions on just 15 students, according to district-level data shared with Maine Morning Star. Staff were routinely scratched and bruised in the process, said Amy Hall, the district’s special education director.

“We started to get very concerned about the level of staff injuries, student injuries, and just the level of crisis we were dealing with in our schools,” Hall said.
So in 2018, the district decided to pursue an alternative. Today, because staff members now view student behavioral issues as a problem to prevent and solve, rather than an infraction to punish — and because of a significant investment in training to execute that shift in mindset — the 2,350-student district’s use of restraint and seclusion is down to the single digits: two restraints and seven seclusions in the 2022-23 school year.

The Maine Department of Education is touting that success story in the hope that more districts will sign onto MSAD 75’s approach and rely less on restraint and seclusion — when a staff member temporarily immobilizes a student and places them alone in a room until they calm down. Research has shown that the tactics “are not effective in altering a student’s behavior and that the experience of being restrained and secluded can be traumatizing and cause lasting effects for students,” according to the Maine DOE website. The state and some school districts have worked to reduce their use for years due to staff and student injuries.
The model MSAD 75 turned to was developed by a Maine-based nonprofit, Lives in the Balance, that works nationally and has been adopted by a handful of other districts — including the much larger Fairfax Public Schools in Virginia — to dramatically reduce their use of restraint and seclusion.
But despite that model’s success, it has not been widely adopted across Maine, according to Ben Jones, director of the organization’s legal and policy initiatives. Although Lives in the Balance has offered free technical assistance to districts since 2022 through a state Department of Education partnership, Jones said only two districts have followed up on the offer.
Sarah Wilkinson, an assistant professor of special education at the University of Southern Maine who recently co-authored a report on student behavior, said the state is failing to provide adequate assistance to districts to make sure these tools can be implemented properly.
“Any one of these programs would decrease the behavioral crises, and then need for seclusion or restraint. But part of the issue there is that the state doesn’t really have the infrastructure to support implementation,” Wilkinson said.
In response to questions about state support, Chloe Teboe, a spokesperson for Maine DOE, said the department provides resources such as monthly office hours, one-on-one consultations, mentoring and regular training, available for districts that want them.
“What works in Falmouth isn’t going to work in Machias or Fort Kent, and that’s where folks at the district level need support to implement these approaches in a way that works for their population,” Wilkinson said.
Since 2021, Maine has limited the circumstances under which school staff can restrain and seclude students through a change in state law that aimed to nudge districts away from their frequent use. But recent complaints of worsening student behavior since the pandemic led to an effort to loosen those restrictions, which disability rights advocates fear could result in a spike.
The Topsham-area district, MSAD 75, is seeing that same increase in extreme behavior among younger students, Hall said, but relaxing the law on restraint and seclusion is not the answer.
“The mental health needs of our population of students have increased, while restraints and seclusions have dramatically decreased,” she said.
Instead, Hall advocates for educators to rethink how they view behavior. Most kids will do well in school if they can. Problems with behavior often signal a response to an underlying problem that educators need to uncover and address, she said.
“If a kid is not doing well, then we need to shift the way that we’re working with that student,” Hall said. “Once we get to a restraint or in a seclusion, you’re way too late.”
Changing how schools think about student behavior
The founder of Lives in the Balance, Ross Greene, a child clinical psychologist and former Harvard Medical School faculty member, came up with the model based on a mindset shift that MSAD 75 adopted.
Greene’s approach helps schools address what he calls “concerning behaviors” without resorting to punitive measures, based on the idea that when children struggle with frustration, refuse to follow instructions, or can’t keep up academically or socially, their response is to act out.
“I get it, those behaviors are dangerous and scary and disruptive, but they’re communicating the exact same thing — they’re having difficulty meeting a particular expectation,” he said.
Rather than respond with punishment or continue to demand compliance, educators can work with the child to identify and address the underlying problems. By temporarily adjusting expectations and focusing on solving problems, educators can prevent behavioral issues from escalating and build students’ skills so they can meet expectations in the future, Greene said.
“The problem is that a lot of adults, not just in schools, see a kid who’s having difficulty meeting an expectation as being noncompliant, and what they do is they shoot for compliance,” he said.
Greene’s Collaborative and Proactive Solutions model has been studied in students with significant behavioral challenges, including nonverbal students and students with oppositional defiant disorder, and those studies have found the model leads to notable improvements.
One district that’s advocating to loosen the state’s restraint and seclusion law, MSAD 11 in Gardiner, said it considered Greene’s model but worries that the approach is not enough to address increased reports of aggressive student behavior.
“Given that we’ve almost never experienced the type of dysregulation we’re seeing in very early learners, I am not confident that only going down the proactive pathway is a solution to the current context and climate that we are in,” said Angela Hardy, the district’s director of curriculum and instruction.
In the upcoming school year, Hardy said the district will try to implement some strategies that worked for MSAD 75 and that Greene advocates for, such as designing a learning environment that helps prevent incidents.
Classroom design as prevention
A special education teacher at the time, Samantha Lapointe started thinking that restraints and seclusions were no longer an option when MSAD 75 first made the change, even though the law permits their use in emergencies.
“It’s hard to imagine how you would do business without those tools, until you commit to thinking about not having them,” said Lapointe, who is now the district’s elementary special education coordinator. “That leads to a lot of thinking about what to do instead — and that leads you into new territory, right around what new skillsets need to be stronger, what prevention strategies need to be stronger.”
Classroom design is one element of prevention, Lapointe said. The idea is to minimize any danger in case a student acts out — and reduce the need for staff to physically intervene.
She started working with students on the floor, then brought in a sofa. When the school got new furniture, she requested two heavy, communal tables instead of individual desks that students could easily move or overturn. The tables also had to be low to the ground so students climbing atop them would not be in danger. And Lapointe hung all the posters high enough so elementary students couldn’t rip them off the walls. Staff also locked the closet that stored toys and activities.
“I’ve still had kids climb on tables, and I’ve had to ask myself, how dangerous is this really?” she said. “Is it an extreme, imminent risk of harm if they fall? You should be constantly weighing out what really constitutes danger to the extent that you would need to go hands-on.”
The other piece was training ed techs — aides who often work one-on-one with students — in the new approach.
“Adults spend a lot of time directing and correcting, and they need to spend time asking questions, seeking to understand,” Lapointe said. “The way you talk to kids matters a lot.”










Adults spend a lot of time directing and correcting, and they need to spend time asking questions, seeking to understand. The way you talk to kids matters a lot.

If a student tries to leave the classroom, for example, instead of stopping them, staff can start a conversation by asking them where they’re going, what they need to leave for and what their plan is after leaving, she said. Meanwhile, she also trained her staff to ask themselves: “What can I tolerate? Why can’t they leave the classroom? What’s the worst that’s going to happen?”
“The level of thinking and intentional decision-making needs to be very high, and that’s one thing also that I train my staff in: intentionality,” Lapointe said. “You must ask yourself, before you say anything, before you do anything: What is it you’re going to say or do and why? What outcome are you hoping to get?”
That’s the kind of training Maine teachers are asking for and largely not receiving, said Wilkinson with the University of Southern Maine.
“Teachers or ed techs will report, ‘We’ve been safety-care trained, we’ve had de-escalation training’ … all of these things that really only happen when a behavior gets to a certain point,” Wilkinson said. “That means that the behavior has to get to that point before they have the skills to deal with it. Teachers are not reporting that they’re confident with all of the things you would do before the behavior escalates.”
Even in the Topsham-area district, the training in Collaborative and Proactive Solutions isn’t complete. Lapointe said it’s now a priority to expand beyond special education to general education classroom teachers and higher grades.
A new approach
The Topsham-area district combines Greene’s model with Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports, or PBIS — a research-based model used in schools across the country that’s built around positive reinforcement of good behavior and gradually increasing levels of intervention and consequences for kids who misbehave.
This is how the combination of the two models could look.
In the library, the expectation for all students is that they keep their voices low and read, Hall said. PBIS lays out a system to reinforce positive behavior, often through small rewards, and address infractions. But Greene’s approach would come into play if a student can’t keep quiet in the library, she said.
It may be that the child can’t focus, keep still, has sensory issues, or is too stimulated in that setting. Instead of punishing the child, teachers try to problem solve: They might offer them headphones, move their reading time to a quiet classroom, or even allow the child to leave the library, Hall said.
Moving away from demanding compliance from students helps educators understand and work with them to solve the issue underlying the behavior, instead of an outburst or aggression stemming from it, she said.
“Instead of just asking them to do the same thing over again and sustain in an environment that they can’t, you try to figure out what’s behind the behavior,” Hall said. “We still have rewards, and kids still have consequences, but the consequences just aren’t, ‘We’re going to put you in a seclusion room.’ Because that’s not a consequence, that’s a crisis response.”

When the Neighborhood Health workers first met this homeless man in Hartford, they weren’t sure he would be able to get around on his own again, or even if he’d survive. The flesh was rotting off his feet, and his tendons were exposed from frostbite.
But last week, squeezed into the back of the former ambulance they use to get around the city, they were watching a video of the man taking some of his first steps on new prosthetic legs. They craned their necks to see their colleague’s phone. 
They could see the patient smiling, hesitantly pushing a walker as he meandered down a hallway.
The man had been living on the streets of Hartford over the winter and couldn’t get into a shelter. As the homeless population has risen, shelter space has become more scarce and scenarios like his more common. 
The Neighborhood Health workers, employees of Hartford HealthCare, cheered when they saw him walking with the prosthetics. Then they climbed out of the ambulance, grabbing gloves on the way. They had more patients to help, more people with complex health care issues like his.

Launched in 2021, the team drives a refurbished ambulance to shelters or encampments, then provides health care on-site for people experiencing homelessness. They’re out nearly every day. 
In recent months, as more people, particularly seniors, have lost their housing, health workers are finding that the cases they handle are more complicated. People often have multiple diagnoses, and with older age groups, there are often health complications that make the illnesses or injuries harder to treat. Sometimes, conversations are veering to end-of-life care.
These conversations between health care professionals and patients are poignant as state lawmakers debate funding for the systems that offer shelter and other services for the unhoused population. The providers that would benefit from the state support — none affiliated with Hartford Healthcare — could help prevent many of the injuries the nurses see in the first place, health care workers said.
Homelessness in Connecticut increased by about 13% from 2023 to 2024. Recent data from the state’s response system shows that nearly 6,000 people are experiencing homelessness, and nearly 1,000 are living outside instead of in shelters. Providers have asked for $33.5 million for homelessness services to help with the increased population, but most budget proposals so far have suggested they’ll get only a fraction of that money.
“When you think about the fact that the average life expectancy of an unhoused individual is about 50 years, a 60-year-old is like dealing with a 90-year-old that’s housed, so these individuals are really sick and complex,” said Kelly Toth, system director of the Neighborhood Health Operations.

In the case of the older man with frostbite, workers did the best they could for him, bandaging and cleaning his wounds. But within days, his legs had to be amputated in the hospital. Soon after, another problem presented itself.
“They finished the acute stuff, but there was nowhere to send him, because no nursing home wanted to take him, because he’s homeless” and unable to pay, Toth said. “So they were going to discharge him to the street with no legs.”
It took 24 hours and more than a dozen health care workers, but Toth and her team helped find a place for him in a rehabilitation facility. He’s doing physical therapy while he learns to use his new legs.
The Neighborhood Health program started in 2021 with funding from Hartford HealthCare, grants from organizations such as the Connecticut Health and Educational Facilities Authority, Farmington Bank Community Foundation and TD Bank Charitable Foundation, as well as private donations.
The team works out of an ambulance that’s been retrofitted to allow for more seating and storage. The team offers a range of medical aid, from eye care to wound care and overdose prevention and treatment. Part of their goal is to keep health problems from getting worse — and even harder to treat — down the road.
Earlier this month, they gathered in a circle at the Hartford office to talk about the day ahead before clambering aboard the rig.
“We’re going to go to Pope Park first. There’s someone who got a gunshot wound in November and never followed up,” Toth said.

David Mingolelli, a physician’s assistant and street medicine lead, said they might see a patient there who has been getting treatment for an opioid use disorder. They have high hopes that he’ll get clean and plan to bring him another regiment of medication for the addiction.
Another nurse told the group that a service provider at Hands on Hartford, a nonprofit that offers housing and support services, told her they had a lot of folks who needed wound care, and everyone nodded as they packed up the ambulance to head out into the field for the day.
Throughout the day, the staff recalled the stories of different people they’ve treated: cuts on a man who was living in a dumpster and was accidentally picked up by a dump truck, a man on dialysis who needed help getting follow-up appointments, a woman who had leg surgery months ago and never got her stitches out.
Toth spent hours removing that woman’s stitches and staples while sitting on a milk crate in a public park. She fears the woman will get an infection.
“I told her, ‘Not only could you lose your leg, you could lose your life,’” Toth said.

End-of-life care
Two months ago, the team started working with inpatient referrals — meeting with people who come into the hospital for treatment but don’t have a place to go after. Sometimes, like in the case of the man who lost both legs, they try to find a short-term rehabilitation or nursing facility that can admit them. In other cases, they just make sure to follow up with them at their encampments or shelters.
In the coming months, they hope to expand to provide mobile medicine in the eastern part of the state.
Many of the people they treat don’t have watches or phones, Toth said. They don’t know what day it is or what time, and even if they did, transportation to get to follow-up appointments is a challenge.
They’re seeing more seniors, Toth added. The latest state data shows that more than 1,300 unhoused people were over 55, up from 800 last year.
It’s been a concern for the past couple of years as rents have risen and people on fixed incomes struggle to keep up. Toth said many of their patients also struggle to access shelters or warming centers in the winter because of mobility issues.
One warming center in Hartford is on the second floor of a building with no accessible entrance, she said. And sometimes, shelters only have top bunks available.
“It’s hard. Sometimes you feel like you’re trying to boil the ocean, but you just take it one visit and one patient at a time,” she said.
The growing number of seniors also means she’s having more conversations about end-of-life care. In one case, a patient with HIV was in and out of the hospital every couple of days. In another, an older man broke his femur and got an infection that could only be treated with IV antibiotics. The patients weren’t sure about entering the hospital full time, which is what their care required, Toth said.
“We need to figure out how we can support him out here the way he wants and have him still have control, do it his way, have dignity,” she said.
She said she’s asking questions she hasn’t had to in the past, such as: If we find you unconscious, do you want CPR? Do you want us to put a tube down your throat to breathe for you? Where do you want to be when you die?
“Within the last month, we’ve had multiple conversations popping up,” Toth said. “They don’t want to be in the hospital for six weeks for IV antibiotics, or they don’t want to undergo surgery. That’s OK, and I respect that, but it’s thinking about how we support them out here and make sure they’re comfortable.
“They can die with dignity and they can die where they feel safe, and if safe is a park bench that’s your home, that’s your spot. So it’s a crappy realization, but I think this is going to be something we are seeing more and more now that the population is getting older and sicker.”
Sarah Fox, chief executive of the Connecticut Coalition to End Homelessness, said her organization is focused on helping people get housed and increasing funding for the homeless response system. For years, providers have said they don’t have enough resources to meet the need.
“For people who are outside, you know, their mortality is increased exponentially,” Fox said. “People age so much faster because it is so stressful to be outside and to be unhoused.”

The budget request
As homelessness has increased over the past few years in Connecticut, more people are also living outside.
Homeless service providers, such as overnight shelters, this legislative session asked the state for $33.5 million.
The providers’ request includes $7.8 million for prevention, including legal and social services for people facing eviction, and flexible funding for things like rent aid, utility bills or other expenses that could help keep people housed.
It also seeks $19.5 million in crisis response, which includes annual funding for cold weather emergencies, and $6.2 million to increase the number of people getting housing vouchers through the state’s Rental Assistance program.
Gov. Ned Lamont’s budget proposal would have added rental assistance vouchers for senior citizens and people with disabilities, as well as a $5 million allocation for eviction prevention and additional funding for the homeless system’s response to cold weather. 
But that $5 million was set to come from the Connecticut Opioid Settlement Advisory Committee budget. The proposal has been controversial among lawmakers and advocates who say the state shouldn’t dip into that money for anything other than its intended purpose.
Speaker of the House Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, said during a press briefing last week that the details of the budget are still being worked out. But the legislature and governor are faced with difficult funding choices, as many programs say they need more money.
Lamont has favored a fiscally conservative approach to pay down debt. But that’s become more difficult to maintain as state officials grapple with federal budget cuts and which holes the state will fill.
The Appropriations Committee proposed spending less than Lamont did: $3.5 million for cold weather services.
Fox said that simply isn’t enough.
“We asked for $33.5 million to prevent homelessness, to respond to homelessness when it arises, and then to house individuals and ensure that they’re stable,” Fox said. “And it’s exactly still what we need. We need every dollar. And when we look at people with complex medical needs, or people who are literally losing their limbs because they aren’t able to get into a warming center, those are our neighbors, and that’s the lens that we look at this from.”
Earlier this year, lawmakers announced the launch of the Homelessness Caucus, a bipartisan group of lawmakers focused on improving services for the unhoused population. Caucus chair Rep. Kadeem Roberts, D-Norwalk, said he’s still talking to other lawmakers, trying to get them more money.
“We’ve just been trying to spread the word, putting a lot of pressure, not just on the governor’s office, but each one of these reps — you guys represent a population that is homeless in your communities,” Roberts said.

Housing Committee ranking member and Homelessness Caucus member Rep. Tony Scott, R-Monroe, called into question the state’s priorities. It’s been hard to get enough funding for homeless services, he said, and he thinks the state wastes money on other programs.
“These are the people that are the most vulnerable people in the entire state,” Scott said. “If we’re not here to help those folks, what are we doing here?” 
Fox added that putting people in shelters and preventing some of these medical needs will likely save the state money in the long-term by keeping them out of emergency rooms or urgent care.
That’s one of the goals of the Hartford HealthCare team as well. In addition to medical care, they carry supplies to take care of people’s basic needs. They keep Slim Jims and mini muffins in the ambulance, as well as a couple of stuffed animals in case they come across any children.
During the recent trip earlier this month, Talia Neves, a nurse with the Hartford Neighborhood Health team, examined one man’s tent and sleeping bag. They were wearing out, and she helped him make plans to get new supplies.
Two people with tents facing one another, and a clothesline stretched between two trees, needed new prescriptions for medication as well as treatment for a wound.

First Helene, then Milton lashed Florida’s Gulf Coast with deadly flooding and destructive winds, as well as damage from unprecedented tornadoes generated by the second storm. The toll of two major hurricanes in such a short amount of time has left people in the Sunshine State reeling and communities in ruins, with barely any time to recover in between.
Few parts of the southeastern region were spared from this one-two punch of tropical weather. Only a week and a half before Milton, entire communities from Virginia to the Carolinas were left unrecognizable by the widespread wrath of Helene. Some were unreachable for days after being cut off by mudslides and washed-out roads and bridges. The catastrophic hurricane also knocked out power and cell service for millions of people, leaving residents in a virtual black hole as they frantically tried to reach their loved ones and even making it difficult to call 911.
Responding to historic disasters like these requires a massive relief effort comprised of agencies from all levels of government, along with nonprofits and mutual aid from utilities across the country. Among the thousands who didn’t hesitate to answer the call for help: dozens of Eversource crews from Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire who traveled to storm-ravaged Virginia to help turn the lights back on after Helene. 
In today’s world, staying connected is more than a convenience. It has become a fundamental part of how we work, travel, and engage with others. From remote professionals managing business on the go to families keeping in touch across cities, the expectation for seamless and reliable mobile access has never been greater.
The evolution of digital connectivity has shaped how we interact with technology. Mobile service is no longer just about making calls. It powers everything from virtual collaboration to entertainment and navigation. The shift toward flexible and adaptive mobile access reflects the changing demands of users who rely on their devices as essential tools for daily life.

The Demand for Seamless Transitions
One of the most significant transformations in mobile technology has been the push for smoother connectivity between home Wi-Fi and mobile data. Consumers expect their connection to move with them, whether stepping outside for a walk, commuting, or traveling across the country.
The rise of nationwide 5G networks has made this transition easier, allowing people to work remotely, stream content, and stay in touch without interruptions. As the workforce embraces hybrid models and businesses expand their digital reach, the ability to move effortlessly between networks has become crucial.
Connectivity should adapt to users, not the other way around. People expect mobile service that enhances mobility, instead of restricting them with outdated models or rigid contracts.
Flexibility in Mobile Plans to Fit Real-Life Usage
Traditional mobile contracts have often forced users into standardized tiers that may not align with their habits. Mobile needs vary widely. Some people use their phones only for essentials, while others rely on constant data access to stay productive.
Flexible mobile options are gaining traction. Pay-as-you-go models allow occasional users to pay only for what they need, while unlimited plans provide freedom for those who depend on continuous connectivity for work and travel. This shift represents a larger movement toward customizable digital experiences, where technology adjusts to individual lifestyles rather than locking users into predefined choices.
Why Seamless Integration Matters
For many, home internet and mobile service are no longer separate. They work together to create a unified digital experience. Whether joining a virtual meeting from a laptop, switching to a mobile hotspot, or streaming content across devices, users expect a simple transition between networks without disruption.
Mobile service providers now recognize that strong coverage is not enough. Consumers want ease of use, cost-effective bundling options, and integration that makes managing their digital experience simpler. As Wi-Fi-to-cell transitions become more reliable, people can move between environments without interruptions. This has become especially important for remote work, travel, and day-to-day communication.
Security and Reliability in a Mobile-First World
As digital interactions grow, mobile security has become increasingly important. Whether working remotely, conducting transactions, or managing sensitive information, protecting data on the go is a priority.
Consumers expect mobile providers to invest in privacy safeguards, encrypted connections, and network reliability. The rise of predictive troubleshooting and real-time customer support reinforces confidence in secure connectivity. Mobile service has become more than a tool for communication. It is now a critical part of both personal and professional life.
The Future of Mobile Flexibility
The way people communicate, work, and engage with digital technology continues to evolve. Hybrid workplaces are expanding, streaming services are growing, and connectivity plays a larger role in daily routines. Expectations for adaptive, user-focused mobile experiences will only increase.
This transformation is not about making mobile access more complicated. The goal is to make it effortless, reliable, and aligned with real-world lifestyles. People no longer want to adjust their habits around mobile plans. Instead, they expect providers to offer solutions that work for them, giving them mobility without limits.
A New Standard for Connectivity
In a digital world that never stops moving, flexibility in mobile service is no longer a luxury. It has become a necessity. As expectations shift and innovations bring new possibilities, seamless, integrated, and adaptive connectivity is setting the standard for how people stay connected, whether at home, at work, or on the move.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Featured-Image_Cox-Mobile-771x578.jpg,,,2025-05-25 05:02:07.316359

(Max McCoy/Kansas Reflector)Jails are hard places made necessary by people like Ernest Hoefgen.
Few are likely to remember Hoefgen now, but back in September 1943 the 31-year-old escaped from the city jail at Cottonwood Falls. He’d been picked up for assault, according to newspaper accounts, and was using an alias. In reality, Hoefgen was an escapee from the Texas state prison at Huntsville, where he had been serving a life sentence for murder.
Stick with me, because this is not a story about a murder that took place eight decades ago, but about due process in America in 2025. I’ve been thinking a lot lately about the Constitutional guarantee of due process, which means everyone should have access to fair and adequate legal proceedings when the government threatens to deprive us of life, liberty or property. This is regardless of what Kristi Noem, director of Homeland Security, may say it and habeas corpus are.
Our thinking about courts and jails and their role in American society has been shaped by Hoefgen and other criminals like him. The reason “In Cold Blood” stays with us, apart from Truman Capote’s writing, is that it’s a story of a farm family in western Kansas who were murdered in a sensational way. It leaves us asking, why?
Movies, books and television also tend to blur our thinking about who is a criminal and who is not. If you’re in jail — or a detention center, as they’re likely called now — you must be a criminal, right? Well, no. There are plenty of people being processed in our jails right now who have committed no crime but who have violated relatively minor civil codes, comparable to getting a ticket from the city for the height of your grass. But unlike policing lawn care, there’s a gold rush related to immigration enforcement. There’s a billion-dollar detention industry hungry to fill beds with Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainees, and civil liberties are being eroded in the process.
ICE doesn’t like to talk about how much it pays facilities, or to have any of its contractors talk about how much they make per day for each detainee. Apparently, the first rule of ICE club is don’t talk about ICE club.
But let’s talk first about how jails are supposed to function.
In 1938, Hoefgen killed carpenter George Richet with a hatchet from Richet’s own toolbox. Hoefgen and a teenage girlfriend, Sylvia Phipps, were hitchhiking near Wichita Falls when the carpenter gave them a lift, according to the Associated Press. Hoefgen later told investigators he didn’t know why he killed Richet, who still had $8 in cash when his body was found by railway workers. The case remained unsolved for two years.
Both Hoefgen and Phipps were later picked up on forgery charges at Scottsbluff, Nebraska, found guilty, and sentenced to prison. In 1940, Phipps told the matron at the women’s reformatory she wanted to talk to investigators because she had witnessed the killing of Richet in Texas. When questioned, Hoefgen confessed.
We know all this about Hoefgen because of due process. The evidence against him was carefully detailed in court filings, he had advice from lawyers, and his court proceedings were open to the public and the press.
Hoefgen was sent to Huntsville to serve his life sentence, but he escaped — twice. After the second escape, he ran back to his home state of Kansas, where he married a local girl named Pauline and got into trouble at Cottonwood Falls. After escaping from the city jail, he stole another car and picked up a hitchhiker, 18-year-old Kansas State University student Bruce Smoll. When Smoll became suspicious, according to a United Press story, Hoefgen shot him to death. Rabbit hunters found the body a month later in a cornfield near Peabody, about 40 miles southwest of Cottonwood Falls.
Based on a hunch from Smoll’s father that Hoefgen may have been involved in his son’s death, and tips from Pauline’s parents, investigators found Hoefgen living in Denver and returned him to Marion County, where he was charged with Smoll’s murder.
Hoefgen’s story is full of odd details that, if you put them in a movie, would shatter the audience’s suspension of disbelief. When he and Phipps were in the county jail at Gering, Nebraska, awaiting trial on the forgery charges, they allegedly hatched a ridiculous jailbreak plot by hiding notes to one another in bananas and tomatoes. My interest in Hoefgen is because his last murderous jail escape began in Cottonwood Falls.
The Chase County Detention Center at Cottonwood Falls has received attention lately as being the last and largest ICE-contracted jail facility in Kansas. The 148-bed facility was built to turn a profit for this central Kansas county of 2,500, and it has been mostly full since the mass deportations began under the Trump administration. Back in 2021 and again earlier this month, I wrote about my discomfort with a picturesque Kansas county profiting from the misery of ICE detentions. Four years ago, the rate paid per day of inmate detention was $62.
Curious about how much Chase County is now receiving to house detainees, I filed a Kansas Open Records Act request for the facility contract. I was told to take a hike.
“Due to being a federal contracted agency,” Sheriff Jacob Welsh wrote in an email, “there are contract restrictions which I am not allowed to disclose any information about the contract.”
Requests, he said, were to be sent directly to ICE.
Welsh did not respond to a request to cite the KORA exemption he felt applied in the situation or to provide the language in the federal contract that forbade him from discussing the contract.
I did contact ICE for the contract but received an automated out-of-office reply from spokeswoman Yasmeen Pitts O’Keefe. The email said she would respond when she returned “Monday, May 21.” As of Friday, I had not received a response from O’Keefe or any other ICE representative.
Max Kautsch, a First Amendment lawyer at Lawrence, told me that Welsh’s responses showed a lack of concern for open records and state law.
“The sheriff’s response violates the Kansas Open Records Act,” Kautsch said, “because he does not ‘cite the specific provision of law’ authorizing denial of the request,” which he must do under Kansas law.
There are legitimate exemptions to KORA that allow the use of federal law to deny requests, such as how public universities can deny some requests for student information under Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act.
“If the sheriff insists on denying the request based on guidance he’s received from the federal government, he must come clear to the public and cite that authority, as KORA requires,” Kautsch said. “He also would need to explain why he is unable to produce even a redacted version of the requested records.”
Welsh’s response raises concerns about open government.
“These circumstances suggest, at a minimum, that the sheriff is indifferent to open records laws, attention to detail, or both,” Kautsch said. “That conclusion is bolstered by the fact that the inmate information portal on the sheriff’s website says access to records held by the Chase County Jail is purportedly governed by the ‘Kentucky Open Records Act.’ Their office is in Cottonwood Falls, Kansas. If the sheriff’s office can’t be bothered to properly identity its own state law on its own website, perhaps it is to be expected that it wouldn’t know how to respond to a KORA request, either.”
Why Kentucky?
I don’t know. Perhaps the template for the inmate portal was borrowed from the Muhlenberg County Detention Center.
To get a better understanding of what ICE detainees at Chase County and elsewhere go through, I contacted Kansas City, Missouri, immigration attorney Michael Sharma-Crawford.
For years, Sharma-Crawford told me, Chase County was the only immigration detention facility for most of Kansas and Missouri. There are now more counties being contracted, he said, especially in Missouri. In Kansas, for-profit CoreCivic is attempting to repurpose a shuttered prison in Leavenworth for ICE detention, but it has faced legal challenges and has not yet opened.
The issue with the current wave of detainments, Sharma-Crawford said, is the speed at which deportations are being carried out and the difficulty in tracking cases through the system. Migrants are typically given a handful of documents upon their arrest containing the specifics against them. Without access to those papers, it’s difficult for an immigration attorney to evaluate a case, he said, or to track a migrant’s case online. In many instances, he said, jails meant to house criminal detainees are unprepared to deal with civil immigration cases.
He commended Chase County on being willing to fax immigration documents to attorneys, while allowing the detainees to keep the originals, and to facilitate attorney-client phone calls.
“I’d take 12 Chase Counties compared to other facilities,” Sharma-Crawford said.
Access to legal counsel is an important Sixth Amendment right, he said, and this is especially important when deportation may now occur three weeks or less from the time of arrest.
“If you’re from Mexico, you have to move quickly,” he advised. “If you don’t know what your status is, you should talk to an immigration attorney.”
He also suggested having important documents, like birth certificates, at the ready, and being prepared to seek a second legal opinion when necessary.
Sharma-Crawford said the immigration system was broken and that things were building to a chaotic crescendo. The administration’s goal, he said, is to artificially clog the system and then claim it is impractical to give every detainee a hearing. But as late Justice Antonin Scalia said, due process applies to everyone.
It’s something average Americans should take to heart, no matter where they were born. It’s something that is being lost among the current rhetoric about crime and immigration. The vast majority of ICE detainees, he said, are held on civil charges.
“I don’t defend people against criminal charges,” Sharma-Crawford said.
If we don’t protect the due process rights of migrants now, he said, we might be denying due process for everyday civil infractions tomorrow, such as allowing your grass to grow too high.
“At some point, this leads to abbreviated trials” and other erosions of due process, he said.
The prospect of CoreCivic opening a thousand-bed facility at Leavenworth terrifies him. The previous prison operated by CoreCivic in Leavenworth was described as a “hell hole” of abuse and mismanagement. The city of Leavenworth sued to stop the facility from being reopened as an ICE detention facility, but on Thursday a federal judge dismissed the case.
While Chase County did not provide answers to my questions about how lucrative its ICE contract was, a 2024 report by the American Immigration Council provides some clues. It estimated the average daily rate for detention to be $237 per person, with single adults spending an average of 55 days in detention. The rate for Chase County, of course, might differ. But with nobody willing to talk, who knows?
Communities such as Cottonwood Falls and Leavenworth must weigh the price of monetizing ICE detainment in the age of Trump against the fundamental American values of fairness and compassion. Leavenworth wouldn’t directly share in the per-day rate as Chase County does, but there is the lure of jobs and economic development. It is a devil’s bargain, a Faustian pact, the civic equivalent of 30 pieces of silver.
Back in 1943, Hoefgen pleaded guilty in Marion County District Court to the murder of K-State student Smoll. He was sentenced to death.
Hoefgen was hanged shortly after 1 a.m. Friday, March 10, 1944, on a newly constructed gallows in a warehouse at the Kansas State Penitentiary at Lansing. His last meal had been fried chicken. He declined requests to speak to reporters and showed little emotion as he was led up the 13 fated steps, an eyewitness from the Associated Press reported. Hoefgen was the first person to be executed by Kansas since 1870.
The death penalty is currently legal in Kansas, but it hasn’t been used since 1965. The most notorious murderers executed at the Lansing gallows were “In Cold Blood” killers Dick Hickok and Perry Smith.
While it’s easy to see the story of Hoefgen as that of a criminal who got what he deserved, it’s also a saga of Constitutional due process. He was repeatedly brought before the courts in the downward spiral of his life, afforded lawyers, treated humanely and even given fruit while in custody. Whether you agree with capital punishment or not, there was no abbreviation of justice.
County jails were typically places where criminal defendants were sent to await their trials or where those convicted of misdemeanor crimes served sentences of a year or less. They were not places for defendants in civil cases. Criminal cases can result in punishment that includes jail time, while civil cases typically involve settling disputes.
The migrants now being rushed through the deportation pipeline deserve the full protection of due process. If we deny them legal representation and access to courts by accelerating their cases through a broken system, we are betraying core American values. We risk turning justice into an unthinking machine run by idealogues and fueled by the monetization of detainment.
It is either due process for all, or due process for none.

You know what TOD is, right?  Transit Oriented Development… building homes and offices near mass transit facilities.  Well, I’m going to suggest you think about TOR… Transit Oriented Recreation.


Did you know you can travel to many state parks and beaches by train and a connecting bus shuttle?  Details on this year’s program are still to come, but the Connecticut Department of Transportation and Department of Energy and Environmental Protection have partnered since 2021 to offer ParkConneCT from Memorial Day through Labor Day.
In years past, beach and park shuttles meeting in-coming trains have been free on weekends and holidays, taking you to places like Sleeping Giant State Park in Hamden or Hammonasset Beach State Park in Madison.
While many state parks close their gates on weekends when their parking lots are full of cars, the shuttle buses can still deliver you to Mother Nature without the hassles.
The state’s modest marketing efforts to attract tourists seem to be working as the number of visitors was up 2% last year.  Officials say tourism brings Connecticut $18.5 billion each year… more than what’s seen in Maine, which bills itself as “Vacationland.”
And it’s clearly our beaches that are a main draw.  Who needs to endure I-95 when you can take the train to visit…
…. Sherwood Island State Park in Westport:  Just take Metro-North to Westport Station and grab the Sherwood Island Shuttle from the station to the park to enjoy swimming, picnicking and great views of LI Sound.

… Silver Sands State Park in Milford:  Metro-North gets you to Milford Station where a walk or bike ride to the beach presents newly refurbished boardwalks, pristine beaches and bird-watching spots.
… or Bluff Point State Park in Groton:  Take Shore Line East or Amtrak to New London Station, then grab the SEAT (Southeast Area Transit) Route 11 bus to the beach where you can enjoy walks along the coast, biking and fishing.
Beyond TOR, how about TOE…. Transit Oriented Entertainment?
You wouldn’t think of driving to New York City to see a Knicks or Rangers game. You’d take the train, right? Well, you can take Metro-North directly to Yankee Stadium, too.
…Or to Bridgeport to see Ringo Starr or Jerry Seinfeld at the Hartford HealthCare Amphitheater… also walking distance from Amtrak and the Port Jefferson Ferry.
Going to see a play at The Shubert in New Haven or Andrea Bocelli at the XL Center in Hartford? Ditch the car and try mass transit.
And if you’re a rail fan, visit the Essex Steam Train & Riverboat by training to Old Saybrook and hopping into a cab for the quick ride back into history.
If you’re city-bound, check out Metro-North’s “MTA Away” packages… train and event tickets, often at a discount… for venues both in New York City and the ‘burbs. You can go star gazing or catch an outdoor concert in Forest Hills without a car.
Whatever your destination for summer fun, think twice before enduring the traffic and maybe consider taking mass transit.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CT-park-connect-1024x442.jpg,,,2025-05-25 05:02:07.316359

(Photos by Andrew Harnik/Getty and Fran Baltzer, Danielle Richards, and Reena Rose Sibayan for New Jersey Monitor)TRENTON, N.J. – The U.S. government has sued Newark, Jersey City, Paterson and Hoboken – and their elected officials – for city policies prosecutors say interfere with the Trump administration’s immigration detention and deportation goals.
Prosecutors want a judge to declare the policies an unconstitutional violation of the Constitution’s supremacy clause, which holds that federal law prevails over state law. They also want an injunction to block the cities from protecting their residents and visitors from immigration enforcement.
“The United States is currently facing a crisis of illegal immigration, and the Federal Government is set to put a stop to it,” the lawsuit states. “While states and local governments are free to stand aside as the United States performs this important work, they cannot stand in the way. And where inaction crosses into obstruction, local governments break federal law. That is what is happening across New Jersey right now. It is past time it ends.”
The complaint, filed Thursday, names as defendants Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop, Paterson Mayor Andre Sayegh, Hoboken Mayor Ravi Bhalla and the cities’ council presidents (all four mayors are Democrats). Baraka and Fulop are among six Democrats running to become New Jersey’s next governor, and Baraka just two days ago beat another federal case against him over a contested immigration jail that recently opened in Newark.
Baraka blasted the latest prosecution as “absurd.”
“We are not standing in the way of public safety. We are upholding the Constitution, providing oversight, and following the laws and guidelines of the State of New Jersey,” he said in a statement. “Nothing in our policies prevents law enforcement from doing their jobs. What we refuse to do is turn our city into an arm of federal immigration enforcement, which the courts have already ruled is not our role.”
Fulop said he would not be “bullied” and vowed to fight the feds.
“Jersey City gets sued for being a sanctuary city — I guess MAGA ran out of conspiracy theories for the week,” he said. “Here is the truth: Jersey City’s policies protect families, reflect our values and have led to record low crime rates.”
And Sayegh dismissed the complaint as “a frivolous lawsuit and a flagrant affront to the rule of law.”
“We will not be intimidated, and we will fight this egregious attempt to score political points at Paterson’s expense,” Sayegh said.
Bhalla also said his city “will not back down.”
“The Trump administration’s treatment of immigrants, lawful residents, and countless citizens is truly disgraceful and often, unconstitutional. Families have been senselessly torn apart, and legal residents who have not been proven to have committed any crimes have been deported to jails overseas without due process. These actions of the federal government are truly barbaric, and Hoboken will not aid this lawlessness,” he said.
In the 24-page complaint, U.S. Justice Department prosecutors led by Yaakov M. Roth, acting assistant attorney general, accused the cities of denying federal immigration agents access to undocumented people in local jails, forbidding local police from delivering them to federal immigration agents, and barring “otherwise willing local officers from providing mission-critical information to federal immigration authorities.”
Prosecutors cite executive orders and police directives that the cities issued in 2017, 2018 and 2019 during President Trump’s first term, but that remain in effect. Such policies prohibit “even the most basic cooperation with federal officials” and undermine immigration enforcement work, prosecutors argue.
“These efforts to shield illegal aliens within the Garden State are unlawful,” the complaint states.
The complaint also accuses city officials of discrimination, because they bar local police and municipal officials from cooperating only with federal immigration agents, not any other entity. Singling out one agency for unfavorable treatment constitutes discrimination, the lawsuit says.
“Such discriminatory targeting of the Federal Government is unlawful,” the complaint says.
The complaint comes three weeks after federal authorities began detaining undocumented people at Delaney Hall, a 1,100-bed jail in Newark that has drawn protesters daily.
Jail officials initially had barred city officials from inspecting the facility, which led to Baraka’s arrest earlier this month when he visited the site seeking entry. Prosecutors on Monday dropped charges against Baraka but then charged Rep. LaMonica McIver (D-10) with assaulting officers by acting as a human shield to protect Baraka from arrest. She denies the charges, and Congressional Democrats from around the country have denounced that arrest.
Immigration advocates decried the lawsuit filed Friday as the feds’ attempt strong-arm local governments into carrying out federal immigration enforcement.
Amy Torres, executive director of the New Jersey Alliance for Immigrant Justice, said the cities’ policies don’t violate federal law but instead “reflect a clear separation between local and federal responsibilities.” She urged the cities to resist caving to federal “bullying.”
“Over the last few months, the Trump Administration’s DOJ has made it clear that they want to make an example out of New Jersey — first by raiding our cities, then by expanding ICE jails in defiance of local law, and most recently by arresting elected officials and charging sitting members of Congress with felonies,” Torres said in a statement. “It is clear that the DOJ remains hellbent on making a national example out of New Jersey. In return, NJAIJ calls upon the cities of Newark, Jersey City, Paterson, and Hoboken to be a national example of resistance, dissent, and champions for justice.”

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)A group of 19 community organizations have joined forces to push for oversight of police surveillance in Milwaukee. Together the groups signed an open letter addressed to the city’s common council, asking it to adopt a Community Control Over Police Surveillance (CCOPS) ordinance.
The measure would require existing surveillance technologies used by the Milwaukee Police Department (MPD) to receive a public hearing and be subject to approval by the Milwaukee Common Council.  The ordinance would also require the department to produce an annual report of surveillance gear. 
  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
“The proliferation of surveillance technology by the Milwaukee Police Department has occurred with virtually no transparency, no opportunities for community input and — without a real opportunity to reject surveillance techs or advocate for critical guardrails — presents significant threats to civil rights and civil liberties that hurts us all but disproportionately impact communities of color, queer communities, people seeking reproductive healthcare, immigrant communities, people fleeing violence, and low-income communities,” the coalition states in its letter. 
“While we trust our local elected officials in Milwaukee, in light of the current political climate and the uncertainty surrounding future administrations at both the federal and state levels (both in Wisconsin and in other states), it is critical that our community has a say in if and how invasive surveillance technologies are used, how they are deployed against residents, if and how their data is stored and shared with third parties, and whether spending our limited tax dollars on surveillance technologies is the best way to promote public safety,” the letter adds.
CCOPS ordinances have already passed in 26 cities nationwide, and calls to rein in the flow and development of police surveillance technologies have grown in recent years in Milwaukee. Last year, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Wisconsin began advocating for CCOPS ordinances in the Badger State, prompted by a lack of discussion on the issue and the impending Republican National Convention during the summer of 2024. 
As with the 2020 Democratic National Convention four years earlier, the RNC brought with it an influx of new equipment that allowed MPD to augment its surveillance network. Before the DNC the police department upgraded its mobile phone surveillance gear, expanded a camera network capable of using automatic license plate reader technology, and purchased vans equipped with cameras and drones. The RNC likewise opened the door for a new open source intelligence software, growing MPD’s social media surveillance capabilities. 
 
CCOPS Coalition Letter to Common Council
 
During the summer of 2020, many people who joined protests following the death of George Floyd witnessed these technologies, and reported suspicions that they were being monitored. As time passed, investigations revealed that local police departments monitored social media closely and drew information from confidential databases, with one agency funneling much of what it’d learned into a “target list” of nearly 200 people. The list had been shared with dozens of local, state, and federal agencies from Milwaukee to Kenosha. 
Since then more attention has been focused on intelligence units such as the MPD’s fusion center, the Milwaukee County Sheriff’s “MATRIX Group”, and on technologies including drones, wiretap devices, gunshot detection sensors like Shotspotter, and spyware. More recently, Milwaukee residents have begun to express concerns about MPD’s plans to acquire facial recognition technology.

The accumulation of these issues spurred the group of 19 community organizations to sign the letter calling for CCOPS. The coalition includes Planned Parenthood, Black Leaders Organizing Communities (BLOC), the ACLU of Wisconsin, Milwaukee Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression, Ex-Incarcerated People Organizing (EXPO), Voces de la Frontera Action, ComForce, Citizen Action of Wisconsin, the Milwaukee County League of Women Voters and others.  
The letter states that “policies are increasingly enacted, and local governments and their surveillance mechanisms will likely be used to target individuals seeking or providing these services. This scenario is particularly alarming given that Black, Brown, Muslim, queer, low-income, and immigrant communities are already disproportionately affected by law enforcement practices.” 
The letter suggests the stage is being set to repeat law enforcement spying scandals from the 1960s and ‘70s.
“Without robust oversight, we risk a resurgence of COINTELPRO-like tactics, where surveillance was used to suppress political dissent and target minority groups, including Dr. Martin Luther King Jr,” the letter states. “At a minimum, people who live, work, visit, or attend school in Milwaukee deserve to know if and how they’re being surveilled and who has access to that surveillance data.”",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_2403-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-24 11:04:53.093139
