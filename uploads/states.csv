Newark’s Parking Advisory Committee is recommending a 15-minute courtesy parking option as part of its first set of proposals to City Council, a change members say could make quick trips downtown easier. 
The proposal, presented at the Aug. 11 council meeting, would allow drivers to park free for up to 15 minutes while still using the Passport app or kiosks, enabling the city to track use without processing small payments.
Committee Chair Rob Gifford stated that short-term transactions currently generate little net revenue once credit card processing fees are factored in. 
“It just barely covers our costs,” Gifford said. 
The city estimates the program would result in an annual net revenue loss of about $17,000, or 0.58% of current parking revenue.
“We’re not trying to give away free parking right off the bat or anything like that,” Gifford told council. “We’re taking a serious approach. 15 minutes is a nice amount of time where somebody won’t have any issues saying, ‘Oh, I was just two minutes over.’”

The proposal would apply to both on-street and lot parking without reserving specific spaces. Gifford said the program could encourage more people to come downtown for quick errands, pickups, or deliveries. 
“Folks might find it as a positive thing — maybe they stay longer, or they feel like downtown is a great place to go,” he said.
Director of Planning and Development Renee Bensley praised the committee’s work, noting that members have taken a hands-on approach to problem-solving.
 “They recognize that there are issues with parking that they want to see corrected, but they come at it in both a collaborative spirit [and] a willingness to put boots to the ground and get the work done,” she said.
Other measures in the proposal include improving and standardizing downtown parking signage, monitoring lot usage with existing technology, and launching a new parking survey to better understand customer needs. The committee also intends to explore upgrades to the city’s parking app, develop a downtown parking marketing plan, and review the existing parking rate structure.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/elijah-mears-lZEvvh2HQcA-unsplash-scaled-e1755013410717-1024x654.jpg,,,2025-08-12 11:57:02.627857

“I’m running for U.S. Senate because the people of Alabama deserve a Senator who will always stand with Trump and defend our freedoms, our Christian values, and our constitutional rights,” Moore wrote in a Facebook post. “I was the first elected official in the country to endorse President Donald J. Trump back in 2015, and I will have his back and defend the MAGA agenda in the Senate, just like I have as a member of the Freedom Caucus in the House of Representatives.”

A message seeking comment was left with Moore on Tuesday. The congressman is seeking the seat held by U.S. Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Alabama, who is running for governor.
Moore has positioned himself with the more conservative faction of the Republican Party. He is the sole member of Alabama’s delegation to belong to the House Freedom Caucus, often seen as the most right-leaning group within the House Republicans. Moore, like nearly every Alabama Republican, voted in 2021 to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election, won by Democratic nominee Joe Biden.
Moore said in the video that if elected, his priorities are to “secure the border, to stop spending, defend our farmers and fight back against the Washington swamp.”
Moore served in the Alabama House of Representatives from 2010 to 2018. He entered the race to succeed outgoing U.S. Rep. Martha Roby, R-Montgomery, in what was then Alabama’s 2nd Congressional District in 2020. In a crowded and often bitter primary, Moore won the backing of the Washington D.C.-based Club for Growth and eventually the Republican nomination over Dothan business owner Jeff Coleman despite Coleman heavily outspending Moore, who went on to defeat Democratic nominee Phyllis Harvey-Hall that November.  
A new congressional map drawn in 2023 put Moore into a newly drawn 1st Congressional District, which takes in the Wiregrass, southern Alabama, Baldwin County and parts of Mobile County.
Moore challenged U.S. Rep. Jerry Carl, R-Mobile, the incumbent in the 1st district, for the party’s nomination in March 2024 and defeated Carl. Moore won the Wiregrass and Baldwin County while Carl took Mobile and Escambia County. Moore went on to defeat Democratic challenger Tom Holmes with 78.4% of the vote in the November general election.
Moore also made a point of distinguishing himself from other potential candidates in his announcement.
“I’m not one of those MAGA pretenders suddenly coming to be conservative,” he said. “I ain’t never been nothing but a Republican, and I stand up for our values and kind every day.”
Moore entered the race with about $250,000 cash-on-hand, according to the Federal Election Commission. Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall has also entered the Republican primary for the Senate seat.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Barry-Moore-Aug-4-2023-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-12 11:57:02.627857

(Photo by Shalina Chatlani/ Stateline)At least 12 states have received federal approval to restrict recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, from using their benefits to purchase certain foods such as soda and candy.
The states receiving waivers from the U.S. Department of Agriculture are overwhelmingly Republican. Colorado, Florida, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Texas and West Virginia received approval last week. The feds granted waivers to Arkansas, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Nebraska and Utah earlier this year.
South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said the Palmetto State will apply for a waiver as well. But state officials are taking their time on the application to “do it right.” The process involves reviewing other states’ policies, he said.
“We don’t want any surprises,” McMaster told reporters Monday, adding the policy needs to be “specific and not leave any loose ends out there that would be confusing.”
SNAP served on average nearly 42 million people a month in fiscal 2024, with about 12% of the U.S. population receiving benefits.
The trend is part of U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s agenda to “make America healthy again” by inviting states to apply for waivers to change SNAP rules to limit what types of food recipients can buy.
Kennedy said in a statement that SNAP has used taxpayer dollars to “fuel America’s diabetes and chronic disease epidemics.”
“These waivers help put real food back at the center of the program and empower states to lead the charge in protecting public health,” the statement said.
Critics of these waivers say the policy could harm people in places such as food deserts, where healthy options are limited, and take away recipients’ power to make their own food choices.
Responding to reporters Monday, McMaster said limiting what SNAP can purchase doesn’t stop people from making unhealthy choices.
“Anyone who wants to eat or drink whatever, they’ll still be able to do that if they want to. They just won’t be able to use taxpayer money to pay for it,” he said.
“Clearly, there’s a strong relationship between diet and health,” the governor continued. “I think we all realize that. That is the hallmark of our approach: common sense.”
Former Gov. Nikki Haley unsuccessfully sought a similar waiver from the Obama administration, saying food stamp restrictions could help fight obesity.
McMaster said opinions have changed since Haley’s effort failed more than a decade ago.
“There hadn’t been much support for this,” he said. “I think the public consensus has settled on ideas that there are things not particularly good for you and others that are. To the extent we can be reasonable about it and use common sense, it’d be a good idea to try to focus on that.”
Craig Gundersen, a professor in the Department of Economics at Baylor University, told Stateline that these changes could harm the integrity of the program.
“One of the main reasons why SNAP is such a successful program is because it gives dignity and autonomy to recipients. It gives dignity to recipients by allowing them to shop in the same manner as their neighbors, friends and family, and it gives autonomy to recipients by saying to families: You are the best ones to make decisions for your families about what to purchase,” Gundersen said.
Gundersen said he worries the restrictions could stigmatize SNAP, which he called one of the best programs for fighting food insecurity.

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)North Carolinians can provide public comment on a natural gas pipeline at a hearing Tuesday evening, the latest step in the MVP Southgate project cutting through the state.
The Department of Environmental Quality’s Division of Water Resources (DWR) is holding the hearing so members of the public can make their voices heard on Mountain Valley Pipeline’s LLC application for a 401 water quality certification.


Pipeline public hearing
The meeting will be held at Eden City Hall Council Chambers in Eden. Sign-in and speaker registration starts at 5:30 p.m., and the hearing begins at 6 p.m.
Members of the public can submit written comments by 5 p.m. on Sept. 12 by mail or through this link. Mail to Sue Homewood, 401 Permitting, 1617 Mail Service Center, Raleigh, NC, 27699-1617. More information is available here.


Running through Rockingham and Alamance counties, the pipeline has been controversial project for years. DEQ denied a water quality permit for the Southgate project in 2020, NC Newsline previously reported.
Out of roughly 150 comments received in advance of Tuesday’s hearing, only three were in favor of the project: one, a coalition of pipeliners, another an individual who is affiliated with the pipeliners union, and a third person who did not indicate their affiliation.
Hundreds of members of the Pipeliners Local Union 798 signed a letter backing the project.
“In addition to the tax revenue and job creation that MVP Southgate is poised to generate, this project’s approval is clearly in the region’s best interest, as it secures access to domestically sourced natural gas, safely and efficiently transporting it back to consumers that need it most,” Danny Hendrix, the union’s business manager, wrote in a supporting statement.
The union’s letter highlights the financial opportunities and jobs that could be created by the project.
MVP Southgate would invest $21 million into North Carolina’s economy and support more than 200 jobs in the state, according to the letter.
Hendrix also cited a rising need for natural gas in the region and said the project has “consistently demonstrated a commitment to environmental-sustainable goals” by adhering to feedback from members of the community.
“MVP Southgate is a central part of making a reliable supply of natural gas available for residents and small business owners in the region,” the letter continued.
The bulk of the submitted comments oppose the project, with some entries spanning dozens and even hundreds of pages.
Some came from organizations like the Southern Environmental Law Center or Wild Virginia. Others were submissions from individuals simply indicating  that they did not agree with the project.
Blakely Hildebrand, senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center, wrote the group’s opposition to the application.
She cited DWR’s denial of MVP’s original 401 water quality certification more than five years ago due to its “anticipated significant adverse impacts” to water quality in the state.
“MVP’s record of compliance with water quality laws and regulations in other states is abysmal,” Hildebrand wrote. “Virginia and West Virginia have issued dozens of notices of violation to MVP for its failure to project waterways in those states during construction of the MVP Mainline project.”
David Sligh, conservation director at Wild Virginia, focused on the proposed project’s impact to the environment in his letter on behalf of his group.
Pollutants from the project would enter Virginia since the Dan River flows downstream into the state from the project’s areas.
“While the direct discharges addressed in the application for MVP Southgate enter streams and wetlands in North Carolina, impacts from the project would affect Virginia waters and Wild Virginia’s interests,” he wrote.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Mountain-Valley-Pipeline-Photo-Ned-Oliver_Virginia-Mercury.jpg,,,2025-08-12 11:57:02.627857

(Photo by Dave Cummings/New Hampshire Bulletin)A few months after Helen Hanks was ousted from the role amid scandal, Gov. Kelly Ayotte announced on Tuesday she is nominating William Hart to serve as the state’s next corrections commissioner.
Hart currently serves as a U.S. Marshal for New Hampshire. He was appointed to the Marshal Service by President Joe Biden and confirmed by the Senate in June 2023. Prior to that he was Londonderry’s police chief and a county attorney for Rockingham County. He’s also a Marine Corps veteran and an alum of Merrimack College and Boston College Law School.
  William Hart
​​“Bill Hart has devoted his life to protecting the people of New Hampshire and strengthening our public safety system,” Ayotte said in a statement. “His decades of service reflect his commitment, integrity, and ability to lead with both strength and fairness. I am confident he will advance the Department of Corrections’ mission to enhance public safety and that he will bring the dedication, transparency, and expertise this critical role demands.”
The corrections commissioner is responsible for managing the state’s prison system. To assume the role, Hart will need to be confirmed by the state’s Executive Council.
Hanks resigned from the position in May. Court records filed allege she destroyed evidence in a murder investigation over a death inside one of the state’s prisons. At the same time, the department was facing major staffing issues; Hanks told the Bulletin last June that 47% of its positions were vacant and the department had incurred a $3.44 million deficit caused in large part by excessive overtime needed to cover the vacancies. Hanks had also spoken out after Republican lawmakers, seeking to cut costs amid a difficult fiscal environment, cut positions from the department, arguing these changes would create an unsafe environment in the state’s prisons. John Scippa, director of New Hampshire Police Standards and Training, has served as acting corrections commissioner since.
“I am honored to be nominated to serve as Commissioner of the Department of Corrections,” Hart said in a statement. “It has been my privilege to spend my career in service to the people of New Hampshire, and I look forward to working alongside the dedicated men and women of the Department to strengthen public safety, uphold the highest standards of professionalism, and advance our shared mission of rehabilitation and the security of all Granite Staters.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/dochart-1024x721.jpeg,,,2025-08-12 11:57:02.627857

To read more about the project, click here.

I am a son of Jackson. My roots run deep – cultivated over Sunday dinners at my grandmother’s house in Presidential Hills, life lessons in my mother’s salon on Bailey Avenue, visits to Fire Station 21 where my father worked and childhood adventures in Richwood Estates.
Jackson has never just been a place to me. It’s memory, rhythm and resilience. It’s where I first learned that community isn’t theoretical. It’s lived out daily through perseverance and love. I’ve always loved this city. But like many with ambition and vision, I left.
After graduating from high school and briefly attending community college, I enrolled in Mississippi State’s Building Construction Science program. That experience changed my trajectory. Through design studios, collaborative projects and field visits to cities like Miami and New York, my perspective expanded. I began to see what was possible beyond the bounds of Mississippi.
After graduation, I followed opportunity to cities where innovation in construction was thriving. I joined teams in markets actively investing in infrastructure, encouraging creative solutions and supporting inclusive leadership. In those environments, I sharpened my technical abilities, broadened my worldview and grew both professionally and personally.
Still, Jackson was never far from my mind. I came back often – for birthdays, holidays or just to surprise my parents. With each visit, though, I saw more signs of decline –  crumbling streets, aging infrastructure, a growing sense of resignation. The energy I remembered – the drive, the optimism – was dimming. Jackson felt tired. And too many of its people had stopped believing.
My decision to leave wasn’t just about chasing ambition. It was about necessity. In Jackson, the professional landscape – especially in fields like construction and program management – offered limited pathways for innovation or growth. Entrepreneurial opportunities were hard to find and even harder to sustain. But what worried me more than the visible decay was the emotional toll: a creeping hopelessness that tomorrow might not be better than today.

Between 2012 and 2022, I worked across the country – New York, San Diego, D.C., Atlanta and Lawton, Oklahoma – managing construction and real estate development projects. Each city challenged me in new ways. I adapted to different cultures, built new friendships and navigated fast-paced environments. I met my wife in New York, married in 2019 in San Diego, and in 2021, we welcomed our daughter and launched my business in Atlanta.
By many measures, life was full and successful. But something was missing.
During an extended visit home during the pandemic, I found myself buried in Zoom meetings that started at 7:30 a.m. and didn’t end until well after 7:00 p.m. I was physically present, but mentally detached – consumed by work. Over evening conversations with my parents, something shifted. I began asking different questions. What’s the point of success if it’s experienced in a silo? What value does achievement hold if not shared with the people who shaped you?
I missed Sunday dinners. I missed HBCU tailgates and SEC game days. My parents were aging, and I could feel time speeding up. My wife and I began to think seriously about where we wanted to raise our daughter – not just physically, but spiritually and culturally. We wanted her to grow up surrounded by family, faith and familiarity.
In the fall of 2022, we returned home to Jackson.
Some say you can’t change a system from within. Others argue that real change only happens when you’re inside it. I believe both are true. And I’ve seen what happens when forgotten neighborhoods are met with vision, capital and collaboration. They transform. I’ve seen abandoned buildings become cultural anchors and neglected corridors reborn as centers of pride.
That’s what I want for Jackson.
I didn’t come back to fix everything. No one person can. But I returned with a strategic vision and a commitment to be part of something bigger than myself. Through my firm, Richardson & Richardson (RxR), I’m working to help Jackson confront its biggest challenges – blight, failing infrastructure and fragmented development – by facilitating public-private partnerships and empowering local talent.
My mission isn’t just to complete projects. It’s to restore belief in ourselves, in our neighborhoods and in what this city can become.
To my surprise, returning has been revitalizing. Jackson’s professional landscape is more alive than I expected – full of builders, creators and entrepreneurs with the courage to take risks. There’s a scrappy energy here, driven by the reality that we have to make our own way. But there’s also a closeness that large cities can’t replicate.
Here, my name matters. It opens doors in ways no LinkedIn connection ever could. Opportunities have a way of finding me based on my parents and grandparents’ decades old relationships. This is my village.
Yes, I left. But leaving gave me the tools, clarity and conviction to return with purpose.
This city raised me. Now, I want to help raise it.

(Illustration by Alex Cochran for New Jersey Monitor)New Jersey received an eighth credit rating upgrade under Gov. Phil Murphy Monday, the outlook boosted by continued pension payments and a surplus that remains among the largest in state history despite recent reductions.
S&P Global Ratings raised New Jersey’s credit rating for New Jersey’s general obligation bonds from A to A+, citing the state’s full pension payments, $6.7 billion surplus, and local cybersecurity investments. This is the third credit upgrade it has given to New Jersey since 2022.
“The upgrade reflects our view of the meaningful improvement in the state’s balance sheet reflecting management’s commitment to rein in its comparatively large debt and pension liabilities while striving to achieve a structural budget balance longer-term,” the ratings agency said in a Monday release.
The news comes as Murphy’s two terms as governor wind to a close. Murphy, a Democrat, leaves office in January and is barred from seeking a third term in November.
Credit ratings reflect the risk of a given investment. Ratings rise as risk declines, and all else being equal, interest rates on bonds decrease, reducing the overall cost of borrowing for the state.
The increase S&P announced Monday is the eighth New Jersey has received since 2022 and only the 10th it’s seen since the 1960s, when it enjoyed AAA ratings from S&P and Moody’s Analytics. The state’s credit rating was downgraded 22 times between then and November 2020.
In its latest upgrade, S&P said the $7 billion-plus in annual pension payments and the $6.7 billion surplus approved in the state’s budget contributed to the ratings upgrade — but warned the scale of New Jersey’s longstanding pension obligations and other debts limit the chance of future ratings upgrades.
 Gov. Phil Murphy (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)
“Although there is much more work to do by the next governor, I’m proud that we’ve done right by taxpayers by tackling longstanding fiscal challenges that stacked up over decades,” Murphy said in a statement.
New Jersey’s pension debts are likely to persist for decades. The state’s pensions are among the worst funded in the country after 25 years of underpayment that began under Gov. Christine Todd Whitman in the 1990s and continued under governors of both parties until the state made its first full pension payment about four years ago.
Only Illinois, where low pension contributions and fallout from the Great Recession have swollen unfunded pension obligations, has a more precarious pension.
New Jersey’s pension payments are expected to remain at around $7 billion annually until 2050, though some pension systems that offer retirement benefits to State Police, local and county police or fire personnel, and the judiciary will take longer to recover, according to disclosures from the Division of Pension and Benefits.
That timeline could forestall future credit upgrades from S&P.
“Upward rating potential is limited at this point but would follow material progress in further reducing its long-term debt, pension, and [other post-employment benefit] liabilities, while retaining structural budget balance and maintaining healthy reserves,” the ratings agency said.

Some states have banned it entirely. Others have passed laws requiring age limits, labeling and lab testing.
At least half of the states and the District of Columbia have enacted some form of regulation on kratom or its components — building a patchwork of policies around a product largely unaddressed by the federal government.
But that may soon change. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is pushing to ban 7-hydroxymitragynine, or 7-OH — a powerful compound found in small amounts in kratom and sometimes concentrated or synthesized in products sold online, at smoke shops or behind gas station counters. Kentucky health officials in June advised the public not to consume 7-OH or kratom products, warning that it posed the risk of liver toxicity, seizures, addiction and other detrimental effects. Last year, the legislature passed a bill prohibiting the sale of kratom to those under the age 21 and ordering the Kentucky Department for Public Health to regulate it
Federal health officials announced last month that the compound poses serious public health risks and should be classified as a Schedule I controlled substance, alongside heroin and LSD.
The move marks a significant shift in how federal regulators are approaching kratom, which they attempted to ban in 2016. It also has sparked debate about how the change could impact the growing 7-OH industry and its consumers.

This year, at least seven states have considered bills to tighten kratom regulations, including proposals for bans, age restrictions and labeling requirements.
Kratom, which originates from the leaves of a tree native to Southeast Asia, can have a wide range of mental and bodily effects, according to federal officials, addiction medicine specialists and kratom researchers. Reports of fatal kratom overdoses have surfaced in recent years, though kratom is often taken in combination with other substances.
Kratom and 7-OH are distinct products with separate markets, but they are closely connected. 7-OH is a semi-synthetic compound derived from kratom and only emerged on the market in late 2023, while kratom itself has been available for decades.



Leading kratom researchers also say more research is needed to fully understand the long-term effects of using both substances.



“There’s much we don’t know, unfortunately, on all sides,” said Christopher R. McCurdy, a professor of medicinal chemistry at the University of Florida. McCurdy is a trained pharmacist and has studied kratom for more than 20 years.
Research suggests kratom may help with opioid withdrawal and doesn’t seem to cause severe withdrawal on its own. Smaller amounts seem to act as a stimulant, while larger doses may have sedative, opioidlike effects. Very little is known about the risks of long-term use in humans, according to McCurdy.
As for 7-OH, it shows potential for treating pain, but it hasn’t been studied in humans, and it may carry a high risk of addiction. Researchers don’t yet understand how much is safe to take or how often it should be used, McCurdy told Stateline.
While some leading kratom experts agree that kratom and 7-OH should be regulated, they caution that placing 7-OH under a strict Schedule I classification would make it much harder to study — and argue it should instead be classified as Schedule II like some other opioids.
A federal survey from 2023 estimated that about 1.6 million Americans age 12 and older used kratom in the year before the study. The American Kratom Association, a national industry lobbying group, estimated in 2021 that between 11 million and 16 million Americans safely consume kratom products each year.
Since gaining popularity in recent years, 7-OH has appeared in a growing number of products. Some researchers and addiction medicine specialists say many consumers, especially those new to kratom, sometimes don’t understand the difference between products.
“It’s a pure opioid that’s available without a prescription, so it’s akin to having morphine or oxycodone for sale at a smoke shop or a gas station,” McCurdy said. “This is a public health crisis waiting to happen.”
 Federal crackdown targets 7-OH, not kratom

In late July, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommended that the federal Drug Enforcement Administration place 7-OH in Schedule I, citing a high potential for abuse. The classification would not apply to kratom leaves or powders with naturally occurring 7-OH.
“We’re not targeting the kratom leaf or ground-up kratom,” FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said at a news conference. “We are targeting a concentrated synthetic byproduct that is an opioid.”
Makary acknowledged that there isn’t enough research or data to fully understand how widespread 7-OH’s use or impact may be. Still, he said the Trump administration wants to be “aggressive and proactive” in addressing the issue before it grows into a larger public health problem.
States stiffen penalties for fentanyl, despite public health concerns

While only small amounts of 7-OH occur naturally in the kratom plant, federal officials have raised concerns about U.S. products containing synthetic or concentrated forms of the compound because it’s more potent than morphine and primarily responsible for kratom’s opioidlike effects.
The FDA’s recommendation to schedule 7-OH will now go to the DEA, which oversees the final steps of the process — including issuing a formal proposal and opening a public comment period.
If finalized, the rule could affect both companies selling enhanced kratom products and consumers in states where those products are currently legal.
The DEA backed off scheduling kratom compounds in 2016 after widespread public opposition.
Kirsten Smith, an assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Johns Hopkins University who is studying kratom’s effects in humans, said she was surprised by the FDA’s push to schedule 7-OH.
“We don’t really have a public health signal of a lot of adverse events for either kratom or for 7-OH at this time,” she told Stateline. “I was, frankly, always surprised that kratom was pushed toward scheduling at an earlier time point. … I don’t know that we have data to support scheduling even now.”
Still, some advocacy groups, including the Holistic Alternative Recovery Trust, argue the push to schedule 7-OH is driven more by corporate interests than public health, suggesting the kratom industry is trying to sideline competition from 7-OH products.
“We think that this is just happening because of the legacy kratom manufacturers losing market share and wanting to gin up a crisis with this,” said Jeff Smith, the national policy director for the group, who said he has used 7-OH for sleep and pain management.
While his organization supports regulation and safe consumption, members worry the federal government’s move could drive people to riskier substances or push the market underground.
“It’s made a profound difference in my life,” Smith said. “We think it would be tragic to cut it off based on such a paucity of data when there’s so much potential for this product to help people.”
 Public health concerns

Federal health officials say a key concern is the growing use of kratom and 7-OH products among teens and young adults.
Some officials and addiction medicine specialists have pointed out that these products often come in flavors and packaging designed to appeal to younger buyers, with few controls over where or how they’re sold. In some states without clear regulations, kratom and 7-OH products are available at gas stations or online, sometimes without any age verification.

“Whenever you go into a gas station and even though it’s behind the glass, it’s kind of eye level, and it has all of these bright colors — it has all of these things that really attract the visual of a kiddo,” said Socorro Green, a prevention specialist with Youth180, a nonprofit focused on youth substance use prevention in Dallas.
Green added that kratom and 7-OH products may be even more accessible to young people in rural communities, where gas stations and convenience stores are often among the few available retailers.
Some researchers and experts say that certain products may not clearly or accurately disclose their 7-OH content and are sometimes marketed or mistaken for traditional kratom.
As Kratom Use Surges, Some States Enact Bans

Some cities, counties and states have responded by banning kratom or raising the minimum purchase age to 18 or 21. But in many areas, enforcement remains inconsistent, and some addiction specialists say clearer federal and state guidance is needed — especially as more people are using kratom and 7-OH to manage pain, anxiety or withdrawal symptoms on their own.
“There needs to be some kind of oversight, including some way of maybe helping to ensure that people know what they’re getting,” said Terrence Walton, the executive director and chief executive officer of NAADAC, the Association for Addiction Professionals.
 State regulations

At least seven states have considered or enacted legislation this year related to kratom — ranging from age restrictions and labeling requirements to outright bans.
In New York, lawmakers passed two bills: one requiring warning labels and prohibiting kratom products from being labeled as “all natural,” and another raising the minimum purchase age to 21. Neither has been sent to the governor.
In Colorado, a new measure, which was signed into law in May, prohibits kratom from being sold in forms that resemble candy or appeal to children, increases labeling requirements, limits concentrations of 7-OH, and bans the manufacture and distribution of synthetic or semi-synthetic kratom.
In Mississippi, a new law that took effect in July raised the minimum purchase age for kratom to 21. It also bans synthetic kratom extracts and products with high concentrations of 7-OH. Lawmakers in Montana and Texas introduced similar legislation this year, but neither proposal advanced.
Louisiana is the latest state to enact a kratom ban, which took effect Aug. 1. Meanwhile, in July, Rhode Island became the first state to reverse its ban. The new law establishes a regulatory framework for the manufacturing, sale and distribution of kratom products, set to take effect in April 2026.
As of this year, Washington, D.C., and seven states — Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Louisiana, Rhode Island (until April 2026), Vermont and Wisconsin — have banned kratom. At least half of U.S. states now regulate kratom or its components in some way.

Gretchen Whitmer in the Executive Office in December 2022 | Andrew RothAfter more than seven months without representation in the Michigan Senate, several residents of Michigan’s 35th Senate District are taking legal action against Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, in hopes of compelling  the governor to call a special election in the district. 
The suit, filed in the Michigan Court of Claims by Outside Law PLC on Sunday, was brought on behalf of seven residents from Saginaw, Midland and Bay counties. The complaint seeks a writ of mandamus from the court compelling the Democratic governor to initiate a special election for the open Senate seat.
The suit is also seeking a declaratory judgment that a failure to call the special election violates the Michigan Constitution, and an injunction requiring the scheduling of a special election at the earliest practicable time. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“This isn’t about politics; it’s about the Constitution and the Michigan Constitution isn’t optional,” Philip L. Ellison, the attorney for the plaintiffs said in a statement. “Every day this seat stays empty with no plan for fulfillment is another day 270,000 people are silenced in Lansing.”
Complaint
Michigan’s 35th Senate District was previously represented by U.S. Rep. Kristen McDonald Rivet (D-Bay City); however, the district has been left vacant since McDonald Rivet stepped down to serve in Congress, with the representative sworn into her new office on Jan. 3.
More than eight months later, the seat remains vacant as Whitmer draws criticism from several Republicans and some Democrats who are demanding the governor call a special election in the district. 
The district serves as a key battleground seat for the state Senate, and a special election could potentially shake up the chamber’s Democratic majority. While Democrats currently hold a 19-seat majority in the chamber, a Republican victory in the district would split the chamber.

Although Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist, a Democrat and president of the Senate, could cast a tie-breaking vote, all members would need to be present and voting. If any member of the chamber is absent, a 19-18 vote would leave Gilchrist unable to vote, and any legislation would fail without the 20 votes needed to pass through the chamber. 
While Whitmer’s press secretary told the Advance they do not comment on pending litigation, Steve Liedel, an attorney with Dykema and former legal counsel to Gov. Jennifer Granholm, called the case a “frivolous lawsuit.”
“Since 1874 the Michigan Supreme Court has held that a mandamus action to compel the governor to perform some constitutional duty is not enforceable by the courts,” Liedel said, noting the ruling has been repeatedly affirmed over the decades, most recently in 2022. 
Liedel said he suspects there will be a motion to dismiss, most likely filed by the attorney general representing the governor, with the Court of Claims obligated to follow the precedent.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/AMR0899-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-12 10:56:33.999591

Mike Braun talks to the Indiana Capital Chronicle during an event in Henry County on Tuesday, August 12, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Gov. Mike Braun hasn’t yet decided if he’ll call a special session to redraw Indiana’s congressional map early — but said he and GOP legislative leaders are “considering it seriously” as they wait to see redistricting results out of Texas.
“It’ll be interesting to see what Texas does because they don’t have a supermajority, so … if that gets tripped up, it’s gonna probably impact what happens elsewhere, because the rest of it doesn’t add up to much,” he told the Capital Chronicle on Tuesday.
“I think mostly what happens here is going to depend on where Texas goes, because I think they’ve got five seats in play,” he said.
Indiana lawmakers redraw districts after each decennial census. They last did so in 2021. Congressional Republicans currently hold seven seats to Democrats’ two.
VP Vance meets with Indiana GOP leadership on redistricting; Democrats denounce effort

But President Donald Trump is pushing Texas and other GOP-led states to redistrict early to secure Republican majorities in the U.S. House of Representatives for the remainder of his second term. The midterm election is November 3, 2026.
Indiana is among the other states Trump’s administration has eyed, along with Florida, Ohio, Missouri, South Carolina and Nebraska, according to CNN.
Braun said he didn’t feel financial pressure from Trump’s administration to call a special session; the next regular legislative session is set to begin in January.
“I don’t think so. I think federal funding has maybe some discretion, and we’ve got an excellent relationship with the administration,” Braun said. “You see that when it comes to education, healthcare, energy, they’ve been in Indiana more than any other state, so I take that as the main dynamic at play.”
He harkened back to his days as a U.S. senator, adding, “I know how that game is played, and I think the relationship, regardless, will be good with the administration.”
Legislators will need to weigh in
Braun’s comments came days after Vice President JD Vance visited him and other Hoosier Republican leaders to discuss redistricting amid a large protest against such a move.
“We talked about several things, but that would have probably been the main topic,” Braun said. “And I think he left feeling like we were going to consider it seriously.”
He’s not just waiting on Texas, however — it’s also about the Statehouse’s dual Republican supermajorities and the two men who’d marshal their members through redistricting legislation.

House Speaker Todd Huston and Senate Pro Tem Rodric Bray have released statements that didn’t make clear their stance.
“Obviously that’s going to be something the Legislature has to see if they’ve got the appetite for,” Braun said. “Because as governor, you can call a session, and you can gavel in and out easily. (But) if it doesn’t have broad support, a governor’s veto doesn’t mean much either.”
“It’ll be up to our legislators to to see what they want to do,” he continued, adding that his  “eyes and ears (are) wide open” to his counterparts in the legislative branch.
Overtly partisan redistricting in Indiana would likely target 1st District U.S. Rep Frank Mrvan to the northwest. But it could also include 7th District U.S. Rep. André Carson, whose district includes much of heavily Democratic Indianapolis.
The national effort has found a prominent backer in Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith, who wrote on X after Vance’s visit that he “fully support(s)” the redistricting effort.
Voting rights advocates have already vowed to challenge any Indiana redistricting efforts.

Supporters of the law, passed as part of House Bill 2, say it will remove policies that are discriminatory and will require school districts and governments to treat people by merit and not identity.
But plaintiffs in the lawsuit — filed in the U.S. District Court of New Hampshire Thursday by the American Civil Liberties Union of New Hampshire, the National Education Association of New Hampshire, GLBTQ Legal Advocates and Defenders, and attorneys from Drummond Woodsum & MacMahon — say the law is vague and unconstitutional, and would prevent schools from providing an “inclusive education.”
“Given HB 2’s vague and far-reaching scope in the education context, enforcers undoubtedly will arbitrarily decide when HB 2 applies and when it does not,” the lawsuit contends. “To the extent enforcers believe that any of this conduct is exempt from HB 2, this merely underscores the vague, irrational, and incomprehensible parameters of the law.”
The Department of Justice is likely to file a motion responding to this month’s lawsuit in the coming weeks. “We will review the complaint and will respond as appropriate in court,” a spokesman, Michael Garrity, said in a statement Friday.
The lawsuit echoes similar legal action in 2021 against the state’s so-called “divisive concepts law,” which barred public school teachers from advocating certain concepts about racial and gender disparities and oppression. That lawsuit led the U.S. District Court to strike down that law in May 2024, after the court agreed with plaintiffs that it was too vague for teachers to follow. The state has since appealed that decision to the 1st Circuit Court of Appeals, which heard oral arguments in April.
What the new law does
The language in HB 2 seeks to prevent any diversity, equity, and inclusion programs at the state and local governmental levels.
Under the new law, no public entity may “implement, promote, or otherwise engage in” any DEI-related programs, trainings, or policies. That includes implicit bias training, DEI assessments, critical race theory, or race-based hiring or promotion.
The law defines DEI as “any program, policy, training, or initiative that classifies individuals based on a classification identified under RSA 354-A:1 for the purpose of achieving demographic outcomes, rather than treating individuals equally under the law.” Those classifications include age, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, race, creed, color, marital status, familial status, physical or mental disability, and national origin.
In addition to school districts, the law applies to municipal government departments, offices, boards, and subdivisions. It also applies to vendors. Local government entities are required to review their existing contracts “for the presence of DEI-related provisions,” a process that will be overseen by the state’s Department of Justice.
The law requires all public school districts to carry out a review of their vendor contracts by Sept. 30 and identify any DEI provisions, and it requires the Department of Education to monitor that review process and submit a report aggregating all school district contracts to the Legislature by Oct. 1.
And the potential consequences for school districts are steep.
“Should a public school fail to abide by any section of this subdivision, either knowingly or unknowingly, the commissioner of the department of education shall immediately halt all sources of public funding to that public school, until such time as the school comes into compliance with all sections of this subdivision,” the law states.
Debate over impact
For supporters of the new law, the anti-DEI prohibition is designed to make schools and state and local governments fairer to all. Rep. Jess Edwards, an Auburn Republican, likened DEI programs to affirmative action programs, and said eliminating them would require school districts to be more objective.
“Aren’t we supposed to be judged by the content of our character and not our skin?” Edwards said at a hearing in April in which the language was first added to the state budget.
But plaintiffs in this month’s lawsuit say the breadth of the DEI ban could affect programs the laws supporters do not intend to target.
For instance, plaintiffs argue, a school district could interpret the law to prevent them from creating sports teams specifically for girl; from making menstrual hygiene products available at no cost to female students; from teaching Holocaust classes that consider how intolerance and bigotry can be combatted; and from attempting to create greater access for Black and Latino students to comply with the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
And the law could entangle special education plans under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, plaintiffs allege, because school districts might interpret the ban to prevent them from treating people with a “physical or mental disability” differently.
“These concepts are, at their core, about addressing the individualized needs of specific disabled people — namely, providing individualized services, accommodations, and supports that, by definition, are not provided to others,” the lawsuit states.
Those outcomes are not guaranteed, but they are possible given the vagueness of the new law and the challenge for school districts to interpret how to comply with it, the plaintiffs argued, especially with the risk of severe financial penalties if they are deemed to be noncompliant.
The plaintiffs also note that the law does not affect just public school districts or public colleges and universities. According to letters sent by the state Department of Education and cited in the lawsuit, any private school receiving public education freedom account dollars could be subject to the law, as well as any private college.
Charges of vagueness were at the heart of the 2021 lawsuit against the state “divisive concepts” law. In that case, attorneys for the state argued that the law, and subsequent guidance from the state Department of Justice to teachers, was not overly vague and that the lines of what should be allowed or not allowed in a classroom were clear.
In response to that lawsuit, some Republican state lawmakers proposed amending the “divisive concepts” law this year to clarify that it applies only when teachers “knowingly” teach concepts that are not allowed. Those bills, House Bill 50 and Senate Bill 100, both died after the House and Senate could not find agreement
The 2025 anti-DEI law does not include that limitation: It applies to situations where school districts allow DEI programs to continue “either knowingly or unknowingly.”
Other free speech challenges
The latest federal lawsuit dovetails slightly with another filed by the National Education Association in March, also in the U.S. District Court of New Hampshire. That lawsuit challenges the U.S. Department of Education’s February “Dear Colleague” letter in which federal officials called on schools to eliminate DEI programs or face the denial of federal funding.
That threat has been paused since April, when Judge Landya McCafferty issued a preliminary injunction against any enforcement of the letter.
Plaintiffs have shown irreparable harm,” McCafferty wrote in her preliminary injunction order.  “Plaintiffs’ members are presently suffering First Amendment violations as a result of defendants’ coercion of educational institutions into censoring their members’ speech.”
Meanwhile, schools and state officials are waiting for the appeals court in Boston to rule on the state’s appeal of the order striking down the “divisive concepts” law.

Housing and real estate developers are beginning to feel the effects of President Trump’s taxes on imports – a move the administration claims will boost American-made products, but market experts say will hike already-elevated real estate production costs. Some are struggling to factor uncertain material costs into their current project plans.
The post Real[...]","MARCO AND DENIS LUZURIAGA’S restoration of an old meat-packing building in Holyoke will soon bring a new restaurant and coworking office space downtown – something officials say is vital for the city’s efforts to grow and revitalize. But the Trump administration’s new 50 percent tariff on steel and aluminum imports – which went into effect in June after being raised from 25 percent – will undoubtedly add to their construction costs.  
Because their project is small, the brothers are luckier than most.  
“The little steel we still need to buy is going to be probably 50 percent more expensive, but we don’t need that much, so we’re talking an extra $5,000,” Marco Luzuriaga said. “If it was a huge building, it could completely stop the project.” 
Housing and real estate developers both big and small are beginning to feel the effects of President Trump’s taxes on imports – a move the administration claims will boost American-made products, but market experts say will hike already-elevated real estate production costs. But because federal tariff policies continue to change, some say the biggest challenge has been figuring out how to factor uncertain material costs into their current project plans.  
In Gateway Cities – where half of all renters spend more than 30 percent of their income on rent and housing production is already only half of what it needs to be to meet rising demand – increasing the cost of construction materials threatens an already tenuous housing market. High interest rates, land prices, and a shortage of construction workers have already strained developers’ budgets in recent years.  
Marco Luzuriaga, a local Holyoke resident and small-scale real estate developer, said many developers are still reeling from the pandemic, when nearly all construction costs increased. Material prices are still 40 percent higher than they were before the start of the pandemic, according to the Producer Price Index, a US Bureau of Labor Statistics program that tracks the change in selling prices domestic producers receive for their goods.

Tariffs are taxes on foreign goods and shipments. They are paid by importers, but the cost usually gets passed to consumers as manufacturers and sellers raise their prices to offset the levies. Massachusetts imports goods and materials from Canada more than any other country. (Last year, the state purchased $10.6 billion worth of goods from Canada.) Steel and iron are two of Massachusetts’ top imports from Canada, at $270 million annually.  
Canada is the largest importer of steel and aluminum to the US. Additionally, it supplies approximately 30 percent of the lumber used nationwide. Trump recently signed an executive order increasing the tariff on Canadian goods from 25 percent established in March to 35 percent – although the administration, for now, carved out an exception for most products under the new percentage, which went into effect this month. 
The National Association of Home Builders estimated in their March 2025 Housing Market Index that tariffs on lumber and other construction materials could raise the average cost of a home by $9,200. 
“How could this have gone up so much? And then I think, ‘oh, tariffs,’” Denis Luzuriaga said. “We’re noticing things going up by about 30 percent.”  
Cassandra Witthaus, associate director of real estate at The Neighborhood Developers (TND), a nonprofit affordable housing developer in Chelsea, Revere, and Everett, said due to the uncertainty around tariffs, it has been difficult to plan budgets for current housing projects. 
“We have had conversations about making sure that subcontractors are only including the known tariffs as of the date of our contract,” she said. “It has been challenging with the tariffs changing seemingly daily.”  
The tariffs may also negate a change to the federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program, which helps organizations like TND finance their projects, enacted through Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Before the bill was signed, the LIHTC program required that 50 percent of a developer’s land and building costs be financed by tax-exempt bonds. But the bill lowered that threshold to 25 percent.  
Like others, Witthaus said she expected this to help clear the LIHTC backlog created by the rising costs – which often make it difficult for developers to meet the 50-percent test – of housing production. But ever-changing tariffs are simultaneously increasing project expenses and making it hard to predict potential cost overruns. 
“They’ve had projects in the pipeline that they want to fund and they can’t, because the costs of the projects ahead of them have gone up so substantially that we have this backlog that’s created,” Witthaus said. 
“That automatically frees up the queue and allows projects to get moving, but those projects have to then be able to have state funding,” Witthaus said. “I think that things will start to speed up, but the things that are working against that are construction costs due to tariffs going up.”  
Other housing developers like Gordon Pulsifer – president of First Resource Development Company – are avoiding foreign imports, although American-made building materials are often more expensive.  
“We’ve been very focused on sourcing products in the United States now – not Canada, and not overseas,” Pulsifer said. “With construction costs on the rise, obviously tariffs don’t help.”

(Shalina Chatlani/Stateline)NEW YORK — After a year in the U.S. Navy, Loceny Kamara said he was discharged in 2023, because while on base he had developed mental health issues, including severe anxiety and nightmares, and had fallen into alcoholism.
Kamara, 23, went to rehab and managed to get sober for some time while living with family in the Bronx, he said. But after he lost his job as a security guard in December, Kamara was kicked out of his home. Now he lives at a veterans homeless shelter in Long Island City, a neighborhood in Queens, New York, and he relies on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program — commonly known as food stamps — and odd jobs to make ends meet.
Each month, nearly 42 million people receive SNAP benefits to help supplement their grocery budgets. Able-bodied SNAP recipients who are between 18 and 54 and don’t have children have always been required to work. Veterans, however, have been exempt from those rules — but that’s about to change.
The giant domestic policy measure that President Donald Trump signed on July 4 eliminates that exemption. Beginning in 2026, veterans will have to prove they are working, volunteering, participating in job training, or looking for work for at least 80 hours a month to keep their food stamps beyond three months, unless they qualify for another exemption, such as having certain disabilities.
Republicans in Congress and conservatives who helped formulate the law say these eligibility changes are necessary to stop people who could be working from abusing the system. But critics say the change fails to take into account the barriers many veterans face, and that the new work rules will cause thousands of veterans to go hungry.
“I’m pissed. I mean, I cannot get a job. Nowhere to live,” said Kamara. As he spoke, Kamara pointed to his collared shirt, noting that he had just dressed up to interview for a job as a security guard. He learned that morning he hadn’t gotten the job.
“I’ve been out of work for eight months,” Kamara told Stateline. “It’s hard to get a job right now for everybody.”

Veterans depend on SNAP
Nationally, around 1.2 million veterans with lower incomes, or about 8% of the total veteran population of 16.2 million, rely on food stamps for themselves and their families, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning research group.
An analysis by the group found veterans tend to have lower rates of employment because they are more likely to have health conditions, such as traumatic brain injuries, that make it difficult for them to work. They also tend to have less formal education, though many have specialized skills from their time in the military.
There has been a work requirement for most SNAP recipients since 1996. But Robert Rector, a senior research fellow at The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, said the rules have “never really been enforced.” Rector argued that able-bodied people who have been exempt from the work requirement, such as veterans and homeless people, create an unnecessary burden on the system if they are capable of working but don’t.
“Most of the people that are in this category live in households with other people that have incomes, and so there really isn’t a chronic food shortage here,” Rector said in an interview. “We have tens of thousands of free food banks that people can go to. So it’s just a requirement to nudge these people in the proper direction, and it should no longer go unenforced.”

Darryl Chavis, 62, said that view ignores the difficulties that many veterans face. When Chavis left the U.S. Army at 21 after two years of service, he said, he was “severely depressed.”
“Nobody even came to help me,” said Chavis, who served as a watercraft operator, responsible for operating and maintaining tugboats, barges and other landing craft.
Chavis said he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, which has made it difficult for him to keep a job. He just moved back to New York from Virginia after leaving a relationship. He’s been at the housing shelter in Long Island City since January.
“What I’m trying to do is get settled in to, you know, stabilize into an apartment. I have the credentials to get a job. So it’s not like I’m not gonna look for a job. I have to work. I’m in transition, and the obstacles don’t make it easy,” Chavis said.
The new SNAP work rules apply to all able-bodied adults between 55 and 64 who don’t have dependents, and parents with children above the age of 14. Some groups, such as asylum-seekers and refugees, are no longer eligible for the program.
Barbara Guinn, commissioner of the New York State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, estimates that around 300,000 New Yorkers could lose SNAP benefits due to work requirements. Of those, around 22,000 are veterans, homeless or aging out of foster care, she said. Almost 3 million New Yorkers relied on SNAP as of March 2025.
Veterans in other states are in a similar situation. In California, an estimated 115,000 veterans receive SNAP benefits, according to a study by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The number is nearly 100,000 in Florida and Texas, and 49,000 in Georgia.
Between 2015 and 2019 about 11% of veterans between the ages of 18 and 64 lived in food insecure households, meaning they had limited or uncertain access to food, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees SNAP.
“We know that SNAP is the best way to help address hunger. It gets benefits directly to individuals,” Guinn said. “There are other ways that people can get assistance if they need it, through food banks or other charitable organizations, but we do not think that those organizations will have the capacity to pick up the needs.”
A greater burden on states
In addition to the work rule changes, the new law reduces federal funding for SNAP by about $186 billion through 2034 — a cut of roughly 20%, according to the Congressional Budget Office, an independent research arm of Congress. The federal government expects the new work requirements to reduce SNAP spending by $69 billion as people who don’t comply are dropped from the rolls.
SNAP has historically been funded by the federal government, with states picking up part of the cost of administering the program. Under the new law, states will have to cover between 5% and 15% of SNAP costs starting in fiscal year 2028, depending on how accurately they distribute benefits to people who are eligible for the program.










This has been a strategic agenda to dismantle SNAP and to blame states for doing so.


– Gina Plata-Nino, Food Research & Action Center SNAP deputy director


“This has been a strategic agenda to dismantle SNAP and to blame states for doing so, because they knew they are making it so incredibly burdensome to run and operate and unaffordable,” said Gina Plata-Nino, SNAP deputy director at the Food Research & Action Center, a poverty and hunger advocacy group.
“States are going to have to cut something, because there’s no surplus. There are no unlimited resources that states may have in order to be able to offset the harm.”
Guinn said New York expects to see a new cost burden of at least $1.4 billion each year. In California, new state costs could total as much as $3.7 billion annually, according to the California Department of Social Services.

Kaitlynne Yancy, director of membership programs at Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, said many veterans with disabilities will not be able to fulfill the work requirements or find resources elsewhere. And it’s unclear whether states will be able to provide their own relief to people who are no longer exempted from work requirements or will be excluded from the program.
“It is a frustrating thing to see, especially for those that have been willing to put everything on the line and sacrifice everything for this country if their country called them to do so,” she said.
Yancy, 35, served in the U.S. Navy from 2010 to 2014. She began to use food stamps and the Medicaid program, the public health insurance program for people with lower incomes, as she navigated life’s challenges. They included going back to school to pursue her bachelor’s degree, becoming a single mother, and a leukemia diagnosis for one of her children. Frequent trips to the hospital made it hard for her to work steadily or attend school for 20 hours each week, she said.
Guinn said the new rules will create significant administrative challenges, too; even SNAP recipients who are working will struggle to prove it.
“Maybe they’re working one month, they have a job, and then their employer cuts their hours the next month,” Guinn told Stateline. “There are mechanisms for people to upload documentation as needed to demonstrate compliance with the program, but from an administrative standpoint, right now, we don’t have any super-high-tech automated way of doing this.”

States have led the way in regulating kratom, and now federal officials want to ban 7-OH, a powerful compound found in some kratom products (Amanda Hernández/Stateline).For years, state lawmakers have taken the lead on regulating kratom — the controversial herbal supplement used for pain relief, anxiety and opioid withdrawal symptoms. Some states have banned it entirely. Others have passed laws requiring age limits, labeling and lab testing.
At least half of the states and the District of Columbia have enacted some form of regulation on kratom or its components — building a patchwork of policies around a product largely unaddressed by the federal government.
But that may soon change. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is pushing to ban 7-hydroxymitragynine, or 7-OH — a powerful compound found in small amounts in kratom and sometimes concentrated or synthesized in products sold online, at smoke shops or behind gas station counters.
Federal health officials announced last month that the compound poses serious public health risks and should be classified as a Schedule I controlled substance, alongside heroin and LSD.
The move marks a significant shift in how federal regulators are approaching kratom, which they attempted to ban in 2016. It also has sparked debate about how the change could impact the growing 7-OH industry and its consumers.
This year, at least seven states have considered bills to tighten kratom regulations, including proposals for bans, age restrictions and labeling requirements. The Missouri House advanced a bill that would enact new regulations on kratom products, but the legislation didn’t clear the Senate.
Kratom, which originates from the leaves of a tree native to Southeast Asia, can have a wide range of mental and bodily effects, according to federal officials, addiction medicine specialists and kratom researchers. Reports of fatal kratom overdoses have surfaced in recent years, though kratom is often taken in combination with other substances.
Kratom and 7-OH are distinct products with separate markets, but they are closely connected. 7-OH is a semi-synthetic compound derived from kratom and only emerged on the market in late 2023, while kratom itself has been available for decades.
Leading kratom researchers also say more research is needed to fully understand the long-term effects of using both substances.
“There’s much we don’t know, unfortunately, on all sides,” said Christopher R. McCurdy, a professor of medicinal chemistry at the University of Florida. McCurdy is a trained pharmacist and has studied kratom for more than 20 years.
Research suggests kratom may help with opioid withdrawal and doesn’t seem to cause severe withdrawal on its own. Smaller amounts seem to act as a stimulant, while larger doses may have sedative, opioidlike effects. Very little is known about the risks of long-term use in humans, according to McCurdy.
As for 7-OH, it shows potential for treating pain, but it hasn’t been studied in humans, and it may carry a high risk of addiction. Researchers don’t yet understand how much is safe to take or how often it should be used, McCurdy told Stateline.
While some leading kratom experts agree that kratom and 7-OH should be regulated, they caution that placing 7-OH under a strict Schedule I classification would make it much harder to study — and argue it should instead be classified as Schedule II like some other opioids.
A federal survey from 2023 estimated that about 1.6 million Americans age 12 and older used kratom in the year before the study. The American Kratom Association, a national industry lobbying group, estimated in 2021 that between 11 million and 16 million Americans safely consume kratom products each year.
Since gaining popularity in recent years, 7-OH has appeared in a growing number of products. Some researchers and addiction medicine specialists say many consumers, especially those new to kratom, sometimes don’t understand the difference between products.
“It’s a pure opioid that’s available without a prescription, so it’s akin to having morphine or oxycodone for sale at a smoke shop or a gas station,” McCurdy said. “This is a public health crisis waiting to happen.”
 Federal crackdown targets 7-OH, not kratom

In late July, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommended that the federal Drug Enforcement Administration place 7-OH in Schedule I, citing a high potential for abuse. The classification would not apply to kratom leaves or powders with naturally occurring 7-OH.
“We’re not targeting the kratom leaf or ground-up kratom,” FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said at a news conference. “We are targeting a concentrated synthetic byproduct that is an opioid.”
Makary acknowledged that there isn’t enough research or data to fully understand how widespread 7-OH’s use or impact may be. Still, he said the Trump administration wants to be “aggressive and proactive” in addressing the issue before it grows into a larger public health problem.
While only small amounts of 7-OH occur naturally in the kratom plant, federal officials have raised concerns about U.S. products containing synthetic or concentrated forms of the compound because it’s more potent than morphine and primarily responsible for kratom’s opioidlike effects.
The FDA’s recommendation to schedule 7-OH will now go to the DEA, which oversees the final steps of the process — including issuing a formal proposal and opening a public comment period.
If finalized, the rule could affect both companies selling enhanced kratom products and consumers in states where those products are currently legal.
The DEA backed off scheduling kratom compounds in 2016 after widespread public opposition.
Kirsten Smith, an assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Johns Hopkins University who is studying kratom’s effects in humans, said she was surprised by the FDA’s push to schedule 7-OH.
“We don’t really have a public health signal of a lot of adverse events for either kratom or for 7-OH at this time,” she told Stateline. “I was, frankly, always surprised that kratom was pushed toward scheduling at an earlier time point. … I don’t know that we have data to support scheduling even now.”
Still, some advocacy groups, including the Holistic Alternative Recovery Trust, argue the push to schedule 7-OH is driven more by corporate interests than public health, suggesting the kratom industry is trying to sideline competition from 7-OH products.
“We think that this is just happening because of the legacy kratom manufacturers losing market share and wanting to gin up a crisis with this,” said Jeff Smith, the national policy director for the group, who said he has used 7-OH for sleep and pain management.
While his organization supports regulation and safe consumption, members worry the federal government’s move could drive people to riskier substances or push the market underground.
“It’s made a profound difference in my life,” Smith said. “We think it would be tragic to cut it off based on such a paucity of data when there’s so much potential for this product to help people.”
 Public health concerns

Federal health officials say a key concern is the growing use of kratom and 7-OH products among teens and young adults.
Some officials and addiction medicine specialists have pointed out that these products often come in flavors and packaging designed to appeal to younger buyers, with few controls over where or how they’re sold. In some states without clear regulations, kratom and 7-OH products are available at gas stations or online, sometimes without any age verification.
“Whenever you go into a gas station and even though it’s behind the glass, it’s kind of eye level, and it has all of these bright colors — it has all of these things that really attract the visual of a kiddo,” said Socorro Green, a prevention specialist with Youth180, a nonprofit focused on youth substance use prevention in Dallas.
Green added that kratom and 7-OH products may be even more accessible to young people in rural communities, where gas stations and convenience stores are often among the few available retailers.
Some researchers and experts say that certain products may not clearly or accurately disclose their 7-OH content and are sometimes marketed or mistaken for traditional kratom.
Some cities, counties and states have responded by banning kratom or raising the minimum purchase age to 18 or 21. But in many areas, enforcement remains inconsistent, and some addiction specialists say clearer federal and state guidance is needed — especially as more people are using kratom and 7-OH to manage pain, anxiety or withdrawal symptoms on their own.
“There needs to be some kind of oversight, including some way of maybe helping to ensure that people know what they’re getting,” said Terrence Walton, the executive director and chief executive officer of NAADAC, the Association for Addiction Professionals.
 State regulations

At least seven states have considered or enacted legislation this year related to kratom — ranging from age restrictions and labeling requirements to outright bans.
In New York, lawmakers passed two bills: one requiring warning labels and prohibiting kratom products from being labeled as “all natural,” and another raising the minimum purchase age to 21. Neither has been sent to the governor.
In Colorado, a new measure, which was signed into law in May, prohibits kratom from being sold in forms that resemble candy or appeal to children, increases labeling requirements, limits concentrations of 7-OH, and bans the manufacture and distribution of synthetic or semi-synthetic kratom.
In Mississippi, a new law that took effect in July raised the minimum purchase age for kratom to 21. It also bans synthetic kratom extracts and products with high concentrations of 7-OH. Lawmakers in Montana and Texas introduced similar legislation this year, but neither proposal advanced.
Louisiana is the latest state to enact a kratom ban, which took effect Aug. 1. Meanwhile, in July, Rhode Island became the first state to reverse its ban. The new law establishes a regulatory framework for the manufacturing, sale and distribution of kratom products, set to take effect in April 2026.
As of this year, Washington, D.C., and seven states — Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Louisiana, Rhode Island (until April 2026), Vermont and Wisconsin — have banned kratom. At least half of U.S. states now regulate kratom or its components in some way.

(Grace Hills/Kansas Reflector) KANSAS CITY, Kan. — A federal judge sentenced six leaders of a Kansas City, Kansas, based quasi-religious group who forced children to endure abuse and work long, unpaid hours.
Kansas City officials helped ‘cult’ flourish despite warnings of child abuse

Kaaba Majeed — the second in command to Royall Jenkins, who founded the United Nation of Islam and died in 2021 — was sentenced to 10 years in prison and three years of supervised release. Co-defendants James Staton and Randolph Rodney Hadley were sentenced to five years in prison and one year of supervised release; Daniel Aubrey Jenkins and Dana Peach to four years in prison and one year of supervised release; and Yunus Rassoul to five years of probation.
The defendants spent 26 days on trial last August and September, and after deliberation the jury found all defendants guilty of conspiracy to commit forced labor. Majeed also was convicted of five counts of forced labor.
Etenia Kinard and Jacelyn Greenwell, who pleaded guilty to the charges, will be sentenced on Sept. 22. Sentencing for the defendants who went to trial was scheduled for Feb. 18, but was pushed back six months.

Life inside UNOI 
The group, which was deemed a cult by a federal judge in 2018, moved to Kansas City in 1996 to “create a heaven on earth for Black people to live and thrive in anticipation of the ultimate rapture,” court documents show. The group was spearheaded by Royall Jenkins — who claimed to be Allah, have the power to create natural disasters, decide if members would burn in hell, and marry multiple women.
UNOI operated in 12 states and had 3,000 to 4,000 members, according to court documents. Royall Jenkins and some defendants convinced members to give all of their possessions to UNOI — including their children.
Children were sent to Kansas City — often without warning and late at night, one former member told Kansas Reflector — to attend the “University of Islam,” where officials promised life skills and education. Instead, children were taught UNOI ideology and how to treat members of the “Royall Family,” to which most defendants belonged. At the trial, one victim testified they were taught that “women were not needed.” Multiple victims testified that it took years to catch up on education after leaving UNOI.
Members as young as 8 years old were forced to work up to 16-hour days at UNOI’s various businesses — with names like “Your Diner,” “Your Bakery,” or “Your Gas Station” — without pay, according to court documents. 
Some defendants instructed the children to tell suspicious customers they were doing an internship for school, U.S. District Judge Julie Robinson wrote in an order that denied all defendants’ motions for acquittal or a new trial. 
Court documents said children were “rarely allowed to live with their families.” Victims at the trial testified that members were forced to live in crowded conditions and follow strict diets, and sometimes were denied permission to purchase items like underwear. 
In comparison, the defendants lived in nicer homes with their own families. Court documents show that Majeed, Rassoul, Hadley and Staton all had minor female members as live-in help for child care, cooking, and cleaning on top of their regular work duties. Although members had given up their vehicles upon entering UNOI, the defendants had access to transportation. Hadley drove a Harley-Davidson motorcycle. 
“Royall and his leadership, including Defendants, obtained the labor of minor children and adult members by creating a climate of fear and coercion,” Robinson wrote. 
On Friday nights, members would attend “math” class at the school from two to six hours. Children would be publicly humiliated and reprimanded for breaking UNOI rules — such as walking the wrong way down the street, weighing too much according to Royall Jenkins’ standards, or using the word “hi,” which Royall Jenkins said was connoted with hell. Their “disciplinary action” would be physical assault, with members of the group punching the subject in the chest in front of the auditorium. Court documents show that each defendant except for Peach spoke at “math” class. 
“The climate of fear was created by not only subjecting someone to discipline, but by subjecting others to witnessing or even hearing about the discipline of someone else,” Robinson wrote. 
At the trial, victims testified of beatings — with one testifying that Hadley and Daniel Aubrey Jenkins held him over train tracks. 
One testified at age 8 she was forced to fast for two days, and from ages 7 to 12 she was forced to receive twice-weekly colonics. 
Peach, who did not have any medical training, ran the “Kansas City Wellness Center” where these colonics were administered. Members needed permission to receive outside medical care and rarely received it. Instead, they would receive “treatments” from Peach. 
Court documents show that multiple members died because they were denied proper medical care. One of those members was Shaquanta Williams, a 14-year-old girl who had begged Royall Jenkins to allow her to go to the hospital. 
Royall Jenkins believed sickness was brought on by personal will, and ensured his members immortality. He said he could spiritually heal them. He died from complications of COVID-19.

While on trial, Majeed said that members of the board — including Majeed, Rassoul, and Staton — planned to shut down the organization after learning that Royall Jenkins had been using the funds for his lavish lifestyle and forcing his wives to have sex with one another. 
“We tried to do a stealth breakdown, remove everything, then have Royall find out,” Majeed testified. “Our attempt was to make sure this didn’t happen again. Period.”
But Majeed said there was nothing he could do to stop Royall Jenkins. 
“Going to the police would’ve stopped him,” said Maryam Zhuravitsky, an attorney with the Civil Rights Division’s Human Trafficking Prosecution Unit, during cross-examination.
Robinson found that each of the defendants’ roles were essential to maintain the forced labor. 
“This included but was not limited to Majeed’s leadership role as the second-in-command under Royall, directing UNOI officials in running its many businesses,” Robinson wrote in an order that denied the defendants new trials. 
Majeed, 51, faced a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.
While all defendants faced charges of forced labor involving specific victims, Majeed was the only one charged beyond conspiracy. Majeed and Rassoul were the only defendants to testify at trial.
The victims testified that Majeed and Rassoul separated and isolated siblings and that he coached minors to lie about their age to Department of Labor investigators. 
Robinson wrote that “Rassoul’s role as the Supreme Minister, teaching UNOI adult and minor children the ideology and rules of UNOI and making dispatch decisions about minors” was essential to maintain the forced labor.
Rassoul, who at 39 is the youngest defendant, faced up to five years in prison.
“All the witnesses with knowledge of Yunus’ youth acknowledged their belief that Yunus had been brought into the cult at a very young age by his parents and had worked in the cult’s businesses (as a child, for free) just as they had,” wrote Tricia Bath, Rassoul’s attorney, in a court document. 
The government argued that when Rassoul became a member of the board he “was no longer youthful at age 26.” 
Robinson wrote that Rassoul was raised in UNOI. He married Royall Jenkins’ granddaughter and was adopted to the “Royall” family. 
Robinson found that “Staton’s role as the CFO, overseeing marketing, public relations, and being the primary leader of ‘math class’ where teachings were applied and discipline ordered,” made him essential to maintain the forced labor.
Staton, 63, faced up to five years in prison.
Robinson wrote that “Hadley’s role in developing and running the biodiesel lab, teaching at the University of Islam, and directly imposing discipline, including severe punishments such as beat downs” made him essential to maintain the forced labor. 
Hadley, 50, faced up to five years in prison.
Robinson wrote that Daniel Aubrey Jenkins’ role in “developing business and imposing severe discipline” made him essential to maintain the forced labor.
Daniel Aubrey Jenkins, 44, faced up to five years in prison.
Robinson found that “Peach’s role in developing and running the Wellness Centers and imposing discipline” made her essential to maintain the forced labor.

(John Cole/Capital-Star)Jonas Nissley is the third-generation of his family to lead Nissley Vineyards in Bainbridge, Lancaster County. His father and grandfather opened the winery in 1978. His grandfather also helped found the Pennsylvania Wine Association, serving as its first president.
“I think small wineries like ours and others are really economic and cultural anchors where we are,” said Jonas, who serves as Nissley’s president and general manager. “Many of us are in rural areas and so in a sense, we’re like a watering hole for people near us.”
Pennsylvania ranks fourth in the nation for wine production, up a notch since 2018. It has more than 400 wineries operating over 14,000 acres of vineyards and producing more than 2 million gallons of wine each year.
Nissley noted that Pennsylvania’s wine industry has been around for roughly 50 years.
“Keep in mind that the California wine industry has been producing wine and growing grapes for about 100 years,” Nissley said. “So, we’re a young industry.”
“And I think that in the short time, we’ve made a lot of strides to grow the industry and make it what it is,” he added.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
A recent Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture study showed that the grape and wine industry supports more than 10,700 jobs, paying more than $518 million in wages, and directly contributing more than $1.7 billion to the state’s economy each year. The industry also draws millions of visitors annually, which generates hundreds of millions of dollars in tourism revenue.
However, Nissley sees dark clouds on the horizon.
“And that threat is out-of-state wineries who are coming in and are acquiring a limited winery license,” Nissley said. “That license was designed to support PA wineries and PA agriculture and wineries who are purchasing PA grapes and PA fruits to create authentic Pennsylvania wines.”
“We’re seeing this more and more over the past 15 years and we’re trying to create legislation to give those businesses an opportunity to operate,” he said. “But not reap the rewards that the PA wineries should be reaping for protecting PA agriculture and an authentic PA wine brand.”

Nissley isn’t the only one concerned.
Robert “Bob” Mazza is the founder and CEO of Mazza Vineyards in North East, a borough in Erie County. Established in 1972, it’s one of the state’s oldest wineries and by producing nearly 500,000 gallons of wine and juice, it is Pennsylvania’s largest limited winery.
Last year, Mazza’s The Perfect Rosé was one of only 20 U.S. wines to win a Gold Medal at the Decanter World Wine Awards, becoming the first and only Pennsylvania wine to earn the prestigious award.
But, he warned regulatory hurdles have been a roadblock for growth.
“We’re not fostering growth in the grape industry today with the way the regulations and the laws are being enforced, or lack thereof,” Mazza said.
Late last month, the state House Majority Policy Committee visited Nissley Vineyards for a tour and roundtable discussion about the most pressing issues facing the wine industry in the commonwealth.
Rep. Ryan Bizzarro (D-Erie), who serves as the chairman of the panel, told the Capital-Star he’s familiar with wineries in the state, noting that Erie County is home to several other large wineries, in addition to Mazza’s.
“It’s a huge industry. Agriculture is a big industry in Pennsylvania,” he said. “These wineries are drawing in people. They’re making money, and we’ve got to do everything we can to protect the integrity of Pennsylvania wineries and grapes.”
In 1968, the Limited Winery Act went into effect in Pennsylvania. The law permitted wineries to make up to 50,000 gallons of wine using fruit grown in Pennsylvania and allowed them to sell their wine directly to the public, hotels, restaurants, clubs, and the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board (PLCB).
“The intent was very simple,” Mazza said. “It was to foster growth in the wine and grape industry in Pennsylvania.”
“And the reason I emphasize that is because that isn’t the case today,” he added. “So, that’s very, very critical.”
To acquire a limited winery license, according to the PLCB, an in-state or out-of-state winery has to produce less than 200,000 gallons per year of alcoholic ciders, wines, meads, wine coolers and fermented fruit beverages. Each operation may have up to five board-approved locations and up to two storage areas.
But Mazza points to a U.S. Supreme Court case, which led to what he calls “the wild, wild west” in their industry.
In 2005, the Granholm v Heald Supreme Court case ruled that laws in Michigan and New York restricting out-of-state wineries to make direct sales to consumers was unconstitutional.
“We have wineries that are being given limited winery licenses that are out of state and I dare say out of the country,” Mazza said. “They have no investment in Pennsylvania. They have no incentive to follow Pennsylvania rules and regulations and the Liquor Control Board can’t enforce anything.”
Out-of-state wineries also do not pay the assessment of 20 cents per gallon tax on wine sold to the Pennsylvania Wine Marketing and Research program that promotes the wine industry in the state. In contrast, in-state wineries that pay thousands of dollars a year into that marketing order.
That’s where the Pennsylvania General Assembly can intervene with legislation, they argue.

“We need to create multiple license classes, just like all the surrounding states,” Zach Waltz, director of Operations at Waltz Vineyards Estate Winery in Manheim, Lancaster County, told the Capital-Star.
This would differentiate in-state wineries from out-of-state wineries who don’t primarily use Pennsylvania grapes.
“New York. Maryland. New Jersey. They all have created these different license types to address the need for out-of-state and out-of-country wineries,” Waltz said.
In New York, for example, this distinction is made with out-of-state wineries who apply for a winery license, while in-state wineries, which are required to use 75% New York state grapes and other fruits for its wine and wine products, apply for a farm winery license.
WineAmerica is a national association that aims to improve the wine industry across the country, by improving federal legislation regulating winemaking, sales and distribution. Michael Kaiser, the organization’s executive vice president, told the Capital-Star that WineAmerica isn’t involved in state-related legislation like this but, “it seems like a natural progression for their state to want to institute a new law like that to give these in-state producers certain advantages.”
Zach Waltz said an enforcement division that takes it seriously would be key in helping these in-state wineries grow. He added that Act 39, which passed in 2016, promised PA wineries benefits that out-of-state wineries are currently taking advantage of, as well.
“Now, we have to also take care of these folks that, to a certain extent, have invested a few dollars in either retail locations or distribution centers, so there will be a place for that,” Mazza said. “It’s a different class, a different license that exists right now that they won’t have the limited winery license that Pennsylvania wineries should be offered and that’s very key.”
“They will not have the ability to self-distribute,” he added. “And that’s going to be the benefit that was awarded to the Pennsylvania wine industry with the Limited Winery Act and we need to bring that back.”
There are roughly 80 out-of-state wineries that have acquired a limited winery license, according to data provided to the Capital-Star by the PLCB. Just over half of those appear to be based in other states, while the rest are from out of the country.
Mazza said they hope to draft a bill, with the help of the executive director of the Liquor Control Board that can be supported by both Democrats and Republicans.
“Ultimately, this bill can be one of the most transformational things that we’ve done in our industry since the 1968 passage of the Limited Winery Act, which created this industry,” Mazza said.
They hope to have legislation drafted within the next 30 to 60 days.
“We heard loud and clear from winemakers about some of the issues they are facing,” said Rep. Manny Guzman (D-Berks), who serves as the chairman of the Central Pennsylvania House Delegation. “Winemakers are looking for legislation to support, promote and protect our homegrown wines and local businesses.”
“This should be a bipartisan piece of legislation,” Bizzarro said to the Capital-Star. “Most of these wineries are actually in Republican districts.”
“So, they have just as much skin in the game as we do and they should do whatever they can do to help preserve these wineries,” he added.

Climate change’s impact on winemaking
During the tour, Nissley noted that due to agriculture’s significant role with the winemaking process, climate change is something on their minds, especially with “climate events becoming more common.”
“You may wonder, ‘Well, how’s climate change affecting the PA grape industry?’” Nissley said to the group of lawmakers.
“In some ways, the warming climate benefits us because grapes like sunshine and dry. However, that is probably a smaller piece of the puzzle compared to the fact that we are getting more extreme events,” he said. “And it’s the extreme events that really take a toll on your vineyard.”
“But it is something that we’re concerned about,” Nissley added. 
Nissley isn’t alone.
Davide Creato, Vineyard Manager of Penns Woods Winery in Chester County, told PennsylvaniaWine.com that he might have to move his cover crop planting season in response to climate change.
“With less precipitation, the cover crop may need to be planted earlier than the spring,” he said. “If we have a dry year, they absorb too much from the soil, stressing the vineyard. With the dry weather pattern we’re seeing, we may have to start planting in the fall.”
Tariffs on the minds of PA wineries
Tariffs implemented by President Donald Trump’s administration have impacted a wide variety of industries across the nation, including the wine industry.
Waltz said that tariffs are definitely a part of the increasing cost of goods.
“It’s not as easy for us to buy everything within the United States,” he told the Capital-Star. “There are just certain products. For instance, corks are only made in Portugal. French oak barrels, which are a very fundamental part of our process, are only made in France.”
“And there is no other alternative in the United States for that,” he added.
Mazza said that he gets his glass from three primary sources: Canada, China, and Mexico.
“It doesn’t take a genius to figure out those are the ones that were targeted for tariffs,” he said.
The greatest impact, to him, was with tariffs on Canada, who he said retaliated against the beverages exported from the United States.
“And now those manufacturers that were exporting to Canada got a bunch of inventory back. And what are they going to do with it,” Mazza said. “They’re going to discount it, and they’re going to take shelf space away from smaller producers such as ourselves, because they’re going to discount those products in order to remove them.”
“That puts us at a disadvantage,” he added. “That was the immediate impact that we saw from the tariff situation. And there’ll be more to come.”
Federal immigration policies play a role in Pa.’s wine industry, too.
According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, about 20% of the nation’s farmworkers are working through the H2-A program. The 378,000 positions certified by the U.S. Department of Labor for the H2-A program, Reuters reports, is three times more than the number of people working through this program in 2014.
The temporary agricultural program allows agricultural employers who are anticipating a shortage of domestic workers to bring nonimmigrant foreign workers to the U.S. to perform labor or services of a temporary or seasonal nature, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. The temporary positions are not supposed to last longer than one year.
As the agriculture industry has become more reliant on the H2-A program, so has Pennsylvania’s wine industry.
Waltz said it’s been a big part of the vineyard management.

“For me personally, and I know for a lot of other wineries in the state, the H-2A program has been a lifesaver for us,” he told the Capital-Star. “When we were to the point where we could not get sufficient labor, that program saved us in that operation.”
“And not only saved us a sense of having labor, but it’s increased our efficiency,” he added. “It’s allowed us to expand and have that peace of mind that we know we will have that labor that when we need it.”
U.S. Rep. Glenn ‘GT’ Thompson (R-Centre) is the chair of the U.S. House Agriculture Committee. He told the Capital-Star in March that the program needs to be reformed because it currently does not help year-round agriculture needs and said one of the reforms could be making it work for year-round work.
Mazza mentioned that during Trump’s first term, his winery had a labor challenge. He said that Trump cancelled a lot of work visas and that forced one of the assistant wine makers, from the Mendoza region of Argentina, to go back.
However, noting how important this worker was for the organization, Mazza decided to keep the person on board in a remote consulting role.
“He’s back with us now,” Mazza told the Capital-Star. “He’s got a green card, and he’s working towards citizenship in this country.”
The Trump administration has directed U.S. Immigration Customs and Enforcement (ICE) to conduct raids on farms in some states, which has resulted in sharp criticism from some Pennsylvania lawmakers and agricultural organizations.
It has not happened in Pennsylvania as of early August, but the concern remains among some in the agriculture and hospitality industry.
“We haven’t seen that in our area,” Mazza told the Capital-Star. “But that’s not to say it’s not going to come, and if it does, it’s going to hurt.”
“But I think just the fact that it’s being done in other areas is having an impact, already in the workforce in our area,” he added. “It has had an impact, I have friends that are in the restaurant industry, it’s had a definite impact on them that a lot of their labor force is not showing up to work, and they’ve gone elsewhere. They’re kind of in hiding, if you will, because they’re afraid of the possibilities.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/nissley_wine_4_720.jpg,,,2025-08-12 09:56:09.796054

After a year in the U.S. Navy, Loceny Kamara said he was discharged in 2023, because while on base he had developed mental health issues, including severe anxiety and nightmares, and had fallen into alcoholism.
Kamara, 23, went to rehab and managed to get sober for some time while living with family in the Bronx, he said. But after he lost his job as a security guard in December, Kamara was kicked out of his home. Now he lives at a veterans homeless shelter in Long Island City, New York, and he relies on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as food stamps, and odd jobs to make ends meet.
Each month, nearly 42 million people receive SNAP benefits to help supplement their grocery budgets. Able-bodied SNAP recipients who are between 18 and 54 and don’t have children have always been required to work. Veterans, however, have been exempt from those rules — but that’s about to change.
The giant domestic policy measure that President Donald Trump signed on July 4 eliminates that exemption. Beginning in 2026, veterans will have to prove they are working, volunteering, participating in job training, or looking for work for at least 80 hours a month to keep their food stamps beyond three months, unless they qualify for another exemption, such as having certain disabilities.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Republicans in Congress and conservatives who helped formulate the law say these eligibility changes are necessary to stop people who could be working from abusing the system. But critics say the change fails to take into account the barriers many veterans face, and that the new work rules will cause thousands of veterans to go hungry.
“I’m pissed. I mean, I cannot get a job. Nowhere to live,” said Kamara. As he spoke, Kamara pointed to his collared shirt, noting that he had just dressed up to interview for a job as a security guard. He learned that morning he hadn’t gotten the job.
“I’ve been out of work for eight months,” Kamara told Stateline. “It’s hard to get a job right now for everybody.”

Veterans depend on SNAP
Nationally, around 1.2 million veterans with lower incomes, or about 8% of the total veteran population of 16.2 million, rely on food stamps for themselves and their families, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning research group.
An analysis by the group found veterans tend to have lower rates of employment because they are more likely to have health conditions, such as traumatic brain injuries, that make it difficult for them to work. They also tend to have less formal education, though many have specialized skills from their time in the military.
There has been a work requirement for most SNAP recipients since 1996. But Robert Rector, a senior research fellow at The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, said the rules have “never really been enforced.” Rector argued that able-bodied people who have been exempt from the work requirement, such as veterans and homeless people, create an unnecessary burden on the system if they are capable of working but don’t.
“Most of the people that are in this category live in households with other people that have incomes, and so there really isn’t a chronic food shortage here,” Rector said in an interview. “We have tens of thousands of free food banks that people can go to. So it’s just a requirement to nudge these people in the proper direction, and it should no longer go unenforced.”
More than 3 million people would lose SNAP benefits under GOP bill, nonpartisan report says

Darryl Chavis, 62, said that view ignores the difficulties that many veterans face. When Chavis left the U.S. Army at 21 after two years of service, he said, he was “severely depressed.”
“Nobody even came to help me,” said Chavis, who served as a watercraft operator, responsible for operating and maintaining tugboats, barges and other landing craft.
Chavis said he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, which has made it difficult for him to keep a job. He just moved back to New York from Virginia after leaving a relationship. He’s been at the housing shelter in Long Island City since January.
“What I’m trying to do is get settled in to, you know, stabilize into an apartment. I have the credentials to get a job. So it’s not like I’m not gonna look for a job. I have to work. I’m in transition, and the obstacles don’t make it easy,” Chavis said.
The new SNAP work rules apply to all able-bodied adults between 55 and 64 who don’t have dependents, and parents with children above the age of 14. Some groups, such as asylum-seekers and refugees, are no longer eligible for the program.
Barbara Guinn, commissioner of the New York State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, estimates that around 300,000 New Yorkers could lose SNAP benefits due to work requirements. Of those, around 22,000 are veterans, homeless or aging out of foster care, she said. Almost 3 million New Yorkers relied on SNAP as of March 2025.
Veterans in other states are in a similar situation. In California, an estimated 115,000 veterans receive SNAP benefits, according to a study by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The number is nearly 100,000 in Florida and Texas, and 49,000 in Georgia.
Between 2015 and 2019 about 11% of veterans between the ages of 18 and 64 lived in food insecure households, meaning they had limited or uncertain access to food, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees SNAP.










This has been a strategic agenda to dismantle SNAP and to blame states for doing so. 


– ina Plata-Nino, SNAP deputy director at the Food Research & Action Center


“We know that SNAP is the best way to help address hunger. It gets benefits directly to individuals,” Guinn said. “There are other ways that people can get assistance if they need it, through food banks or other charitable organizations, but we do not think that those organizations will have the capacity to pick up the needs.”
A greater burden on states
In addition to the work rule changes, the new law reduces federal funding for SNAP by about $186 billion through 2034 — a cut of roughly 20%, according to the Congressional Budget Office, an independent research arm of Congress. The federal government expects the new work requirements to reduce SNAP spending by $69 billion as people who don’t comply are dropped from the rolls.
SNAP has historically been funded by the federal government, with states picking up part of the cost of administering the program. Under the new law, states will have to cover between 5% and 15% of SNAP costs starting in fiscal year 2028, depending on how accurately they distribute benefits to people who are eligible for the program.
“This has been a strategic agenda to dismantle SNAP and to blame states for doing so, because they knew they are making it so incredibly burdensome to run and operate and unaffordable,” said Gina Plata-Nino, SNAP deputy director at the Food Research & Action Center, a poverty and hunger advocacy group.
“States are going to have to cut something, because there’s no surplus. There are no unlimited resources that states may have in order to be able to offset the harm.”
Guinn said New York expects to see a new cost burden of at least $1.4 billion each year. In California, new state costs could total as much as $3.7 billion annually, according to the California Department of Social Services.
A dozen states win approval to restrict soda, candy for SNAP recipients

Kaitlynne Yancy, director of membership programs at Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, said many veterans with disabilities will not be able to fulfill the work requirements or find resources elsewhere. And it’s unclear whether states will be able to provide their own relief to people who are no longer exempted from work requirements or will be excluded from the program.
“It is a frustrating thing to see, especially for those that have been willing to put everything on the line and sacrifice everything for this country if their country called them to do so,” she said.
Yancy, 35, served in the U.S. Navy from 2010 to 2014. She began to use food stamps and the Medicaid program, the public health insurance program for people with lower incomes, as she navigated life’s challenges. They included going back to school to pursue her bachelor’s degree, becoming a single mother, and a leukemia diagnosis for one of her children. Frequent trips to the hospital made it hard for her to work steadily or attend school for 20 hours each week, she said.

Guinn said the new rules will create significant administrative challenges, too; even SNAP recipients who are working will struggle to prove it.
“Maybe they’re working one month, they have a job, and then their employer cuts their hours the next month,” Guinn told Stateline. “There are mechanisms for people to upload documentation as needed to demonstrate compliance with the program, but from an administrative standpoint, right now, we don’t have any super-high-tech automated way of doing this.”

The Democratic primary to replace late Rep. Melissa Hortman is Tuesday.
Voters in House District 34B, which covers parts of Brooklyn Park, Champlin and Coon Rapids, will decide which of three Democratic candidates will face Republican Ruth Bittner in the general election on Sept. 16.
Hortman, who served as House speaker from 2019 to 2024, and her husband, Mark, were killed two months ago in a political assassination.
Hortman first ran for office in 1998 and 2002 but didn’t win the former swing district until 2004. The district has since become strongly Democratic, with Hortman winning last year’s election by 26 percentage points. Vice President Kamala Harris won the district by 27 percentage points. 
Here’s how to find out if you live in the district. Minnesota has same-day voter registration, so if you live in the district, you just need to show up with a proof of residence. Acceptable forms can be found here.
The three Democratic-Farmer-Labor candidates running in the primary Tuesday are Xp Lee, Christian Eriksen and Erickson Saye.
Lee, the DFL-endorsed candidate, is a health equity strategist for the Minnesota Department of Health. He served on the Brooklyn Park City Council from 2022 to 2024.
Eriksen is also a Brooklyn Park City Council member — first elected in 2022 — and is a former chair of the city’s Human Rights Commission.
Saye is a Hennepin County prosecutor who worked as the lead DFL organizer in the 3rd Congressional District in 2018. Saye also worked in the Walz administration on constituent services and veteran affairs and served as the policy director of Minnesota Voice, a nonprofit focused on voter engagement.
Bittner, the sole Republican in the race, currently works as a real estate agent. She has never held public office, and she was formerly a food scientist.
There are three empty seats in the Minnesota Legislature following the resignation of Sen. Nicole Mitchell, DFL-Woodbury, and the death of Sen. Bruce Anderson, R-Buffalo.
DFL House Reps. Amanda Hemmingsen-Jaeger and Ethan Cha are running as candidates to replace Mitchell. If one of them wins, Gov. Tim Walz will need to call yet another special election to fill the empty House seat.
Voters in the two Senate districts will go to the polls on Nov. 4 to replace the senators.

The resounding message of the administration? Free speech comes with a steep price.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Jack Pitblado: The Trump administration’s attack on free speech is alive in Milton.","This commentary is by Jack Pitblado, of Burlington. He is the climate action coordinator for the Vermont Natural Resources Council.


When I started my new job at the Vermont Natural Resources Council this spring, I stepped into the middle of a legislative session unlike any other. President Donald Trump was hacking his way through our government institutions and slashing investments in climate and energy programs. 
We saw the trickle-down effects of these actions. In the weeks after Trump signed an executive order aimed at Vermont’s Climate Superfund Law, our opponents in the House and Senate called to repeal fundamental provisions of the Global Warming Solutions Act and to strip funding to implement the superfund. These are two backbone climate laws that put Vermont on a path to climate resilience and lay the groundwork to reduce fossil fuels and electrify our communities. 
To help fight against these attacks on critical climate policy, I urged Vermonters through countless calls and emails to reach out to their representatives and senators to ask that they vote against these proposed rollbacks. 
One of the people I spoke to was Henry Bonges, a resident of Milton, 10-year community volunteer on Milton’s Energy Committee and former Democratic candidate for state representative.

READ MORE

Bonges’ email to the Milton delegation, to which I was also a recipient, was not so different from most communications between legislators and concerned constituents. He asked them to support meaningful climate action and to embrace the scientific evidence that forebodes existential threats. 
In doing so, he appealed to his representatives to stand against this wave of attacks, and to think independently and clearly, unlike their peers in Congress and the White House. 
His appeal did not move his representatives into action. Instead, Bonges was ousted from his board and commission posts by the Milton Selectboard for speaking out.
Some of the members who voted him out happened to be on the receiving end of that email: Reps. Leland Morgan, R-Milton, and Brenda Steady, R-Milton. These two also co-sponsored H.518, the bill to repeal Vermont’s landmark Climate Superfund Law.
Bonges’s removal was a shock. But, when looking at it closely, it is clear that many Vermont elected officials are willing to follow Trump’s lead in pushing for major climate rollbacks. It was only a matter of time before our local leaders adopted Trump’s framework for shutting down the opposition.
Trump’s approach to handling dissent is relatively new (or perhaps resurgent) in American politics — shutting up the opposition. It is a simple three-step playbook: consecrate power into the hands of friends, bend the rules to your will and make your doubters pay.
He deployed Marines to tamp down protests on the streets of Los Angeles. He fired General Charles Q. Brown from his position as chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in February for producing a video five years earlier that Trump deemed too focused on diversity. He has unlawfully detained Palestinian rights activists and pursued deportation for those who speak out.
The resounding message of the administration? Free speech comes with a steep price.
The parallels between Trump’s actions and those of the Milton Selectboard are clear.
I believe the Milton Selectboard has become a social club for the town’s Republican caucus, with Rep. Michael Morgan, Leland Morgan and Steady serving as members, and Rep. Chris Taylor, in a paid capacity as town manager after leaving the selectboard for the position in May.
With the state delegation taking a majority on the selectboard, decisions to hire and fire, commission and decommission are up to their majority votes.
Since power is so consolidated, the rules are subject to their administrators. There is nothing unethical about an engaged community member pleading to his representatives on how they should vote in Montpelier, even if Steady and Leland Morgan did not like his terse choice of words. 
There are, however, serious ethical concerns with local elected officials mixing their duties to be responsive to community input with their political apprehensions about the necessity of climate action — and personal disputes with a former Democratic legislative candidate in Milton.
They may disagree with Bonges, and that’s their prerogative. But disagreement doesn’t warrant retribution. Just because the president does it, doesn’t mean they should.
The primary consequence of Bonges’ removal is intimidation.
So many of the most politically active members of our communities serve on several town boards and commissions. They truly care about their neighbors and they want to live out their values, not just pay lip service to them. 
Removing a committed public servant for his views only sends a message to others that they should get in line or get out. It’s undemocratic and unacceptable.
This kind of vindictive behavior is not fitting for the peoples’ representatives. For the sake of Milton, I hope all residents concerned with the state of our democracy and freedom of speech speak up for Henry to be reinstated to his posts.

For consumers who want their personal data scrubbed from data brokering companies, removing your information isn’t always clear cut — despite a state law that aims to assist with just that.
As CalMatters and The Markup’s Colin Lecher and Tomas Apodaca explain, California requires companies that make most of their money from selling consumer data to provide customers a way to request their data be deleted.
But among the state’s most recent database of nearly 500 data brokers, Colin and Tomas found that 35 companies had code that hid their deletion instructions from showing up in Google searches.
Telesign, for example, which advertises fraud-prevention services for businesses, buried the link to its “Data Deletion” and “Opt Out / Do Not Sell” form about 7,000 words deep into its legalese-ridden privacy policy. This form is also hidden from search engines and isn’t linked on its homepage. 
To help Californians protect their privacy, lawmakers in 2023 passed the Delete Act, which established the creation of the “Delete Request and Opt-out Platform.” Beginning 2026, DROP will enable consumers to send a single request to data brokers on the registry for their data to be deleted.

CA may be on the hook for PG&E loan

To keep California’s last nuclear power plant running, the Newsom administration in 2022 successfully requested a $1.4 billion loan from the Legislature in 2022. But while lawmakers expected a federal award to fully cover the loan down the road, an analysis by CalMatters’ Malena Carollo found that nearly half may not get repaid.
Diablo Canyon is run by Pacific Gas and Electric and provides roughly 8% of the state’s total energy. Though it was slated to shut down this year due to economic reasons, state regulators voted to extend its operations until 2030.
While seeking approval for the loan, Newsom’s administration said a federal program from the U.S. Department of Energy would pay for the loan. But by law, the department could only award $1.2 billion each cycle, and PG&E applied for a $1.1 billion loan that was shy of that maximum. The utility company is also unlikely to use profits from the plant to make up the difference, since PG&E said it expects its costs for the plant to exceed the loan.

CA congressmember faces constituents’ wrath

Leaders in the GOP in recent months have been discouraging Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives from hosting face-to-face forums after a series of town hall confrontations went viral earlier this year. But Rep. Doug LaMalfa, who represents parts of California’s rural north, held one anyway — and it was about as raucous as one would expect.
More than 650 people attended LaMalfa’s town hall in Chico on Monday, reports CalMatters’ Maya C. Miller. For nearly 90 minutes, the crowd interjected, booed and jeered the congressmember, slamming LaMalfa’s vote for President Donald Trump’s budget bill. The budget guts Medicaid spending by more than $1.1 trillion over the next 10 years, a move that will harm rural hospitals and people, the crowd said.
During the event, Navy veteran Ryan Rogoski told LaMalfa that he must drive three hours round-trip to see a therapist for PTSD due to the lack of mental health providers in the Chico area. Though LaMalfa acknowledged that Rogoski’s situation was unacceptable, LaMalfa blamed local Chico VA leadership for mismanagement.
Rogoski left the meeting in tears, and later told CalMatters that LaMalfa’s answer was “extremely false.”

Some companies are making it extra difficult,Colin Lecher and Tomas Apodaca,,,,,https://calmatters.org/economy/technology/2025/08/companies-make-it-hard-to-delete-personal-data/,The Markup and CalMatters found dozens of sites preventing their legally required opt-out pages from being indexed.,"In summary
The Markup and CalMatters found dozens of sites preventing their legally required opt-out pages from being indexed.


Data brokers are required by California law to provide ways for consumers to request their data be deleted. But good luck finding them.
More than 30 of the companies, which collect and sell consumers’ personal information, hid their deletion instructions from Google, according to a review by The Markup and CalMatters of hundreds of broker websites. This creates one more obstacle for consumers who want to delete their data. 
Many of the pages containing the instructions, listed in an official state registry, use code to tell search engines to remove the page entirely from search results. Popular tools like Google and Bing respect the code by excluding pages when responding to users.
Data brokers nationwide must register in California under the state’s Consumer Privacy Act, which allows Californians to request that their information be removed, that it not be sold, or that they get access to it. 
After reviewing the websites of all 499 data brokers registered with the state, we found 35 had code to stop certain pages from showing up in searches.
While those companies might be fulfilling the letter of the law by providing a page consumers can use to delete their data, it means little if those consumers can’t find the page, according to Matthew Schwartz, a policy analyst at Consumer Reports who studies the California law governing data brokers and other privacy issues. 
“This sounds to me like a clever work around to make it as hard as possible for consumers to find it,” Schwartz said.
After The Markup and CalMatters contacted the data brokers, seven said they would review the code on their websites or remove it entirely, and another two said they had independently deleted the code before being contacted. The Markup and CalMatters confirmed eight of the nine companies removed the code. 
Two companies said they added the code intentionally to avoid spam at the recommendation of experts and would not change it. The other 24 companies didn’t respond to a request for comment; however, three removed the code after The Markup and CalMatters contacted them. 
(See the data on our GitHub repo.)
“This sounds to me like a clever work around to make it as hard as possible for consumers to find it.”Matthew Schwartz, policy analyst, Consumer Reports
Most of the companies that did respond said they were unaware the code was on their pages. 
“The presence of the [code] on our opt-out page was indeed an oversight and not intentional,” May Haddad, a spokesperson for data company FourthWall, said in an emailed response. “Our team promptly rectified the issue upon being informed. As a standard practice, all critical pages—including opt-out and privacy pages—are intended to be indexed by default to ensure maximum visibility and accessibility.” The Markup and CalMatters confirmed that the code had been removed as of July 31.
Some companies that hid their privacy instructions from search engines included a small link at the bottom of their homepage. Accessing it often required scrolling multiple screens, dismissing pop-ups for cookie permissions and newsletter sign-ups and then finding a link that was a fraction the size of other text on the page. 
So consumers still faced a serious hurdle when trying to get their information deleted.
Take the simple opt-out form for ipapi, a service offered by Kloudend, Inc that finds the physical locations of internet visitors based on their IP addresses. People can go to the company’s website to request that the company “Do Not Sell” their personal data or to invoke their “Right to Delete” it — but they would have had trouble finding the form, since it contained code excluding it from search results. A spokesperson for Kloudend described the code as an “oversight” and said the page had been changed to be visible to search engines; The Markup and CalMatters confirmed that the code had been removed as of July 31.
Telesign, a company that advertises fraud-prevention services for businesses, offers a simple form for “Data Deletion” and “Opt Out / Do Not Sell”. But that form is hidden from search engines and other automated systems, and isn’t linked on its homepage. 
Instead, consumers must search about 7,000 words into a privacy policy filled with legalese to find a link to the page. 
A spokesperson for Telesign didn’t respond to a request for comment.

Five of the pages listed in the California registry not only aren’t indexed for search, but don’t exist. For example, a company called BrightCheck, which offers “AI-driven identity verification,” lists a privacy instructions page on the California registry. But when The Markup and CalMatters visited the page in late July, we found a notice that the page no longer exists. The page was there on March 18 when The Markup and CalMatters first scanned the site, and the Wayback Machine has an archive of the page from February 14. 
BrightCheck didn’t respond to a request for comment.
The CCPA
The California Consumer Privacy Act went into effect in 2020, governing companies that make most of their revenue from selling consumer data, or who make more than $25 million per year or handle the data of more than 100,000 people in the state. With no comprehensive federal privacy law, the law is among the few regulations data brokers must comply with. 
California’s most recent broker database lists nearly 500 companies, most of which consumers have likely never heard of. They include businesses with zippy start-up names like StatSocial and UpLead, and offer everything from email marketing tools to contact directories. CalMatters last year published a guide with information on how consumers can exercise their rights using the database or third-party tools and on how they can request deletion of their children’ s information.
Tom Kemp, executive director of the entity tasked with enforcing the privacy law, the California Privacy Protection Agency, said in an interview that the agency had reproduced The Markup and CalMatters’ findings. While he declined to comment on any particular company’s practices, he pointed to an enforcement advisory from the agency on “dark patterns,” which are design choices that have “the substantial effect of subverting or impairing a consumer’s autonomy, decisionmaking, or choice.”
If a company makes it much more difficult to choose to remove their personal data than to contribute it, or includes excessive jargon or other hurdles for consumers to jump through to remove it, according to the advisory, they might be violating the law.
This year, the privacy agency has taken enforcement action against companies including Todd Snyder and Honda for, among other violations, making it too difficult to choose to not have their data used. Todd Snyder paid a nearly $350,000 fine this year, while Honda agreed to pay more than $630,000. Both agreed to overhaul their privacy practices.
Kemp said that, when determining whether a company has violated the privacy act, it’s important to determine whether there’s a pattern of activity making it difficult for consumers to exercise their rights. Hiding a privacy instructions page could be the first “thread” in determining whether a company is shirking their obligations. 
In the past, other companies have been criticized for hiding important web pages from search engines. In 2019, ProPublica revealed how the company behind tax filing service TurboTax added code to effectively hide an option for users to file their taxes for free. A 2021 report from the Wall Street Journal found that hospitals were hiding prices they were required to post under federal transparency rules. 
Recognizing that most Californians have never heard of the hundreds of companies in the data broker registry, lawmakers in California recently passed the Delete Act. The law will create a system called the Delete Request and Opt-out Platform, or DROP, which will allow consumers in California to send a single, legally binding request to all data brokers on the registry at one time. The privacy protection agency intends to launch it next year.

Methodology
In the course of our investigation, we made adjustments to some URLs in California’s registry. For 64 sites, we removed “www.” from the beginning of the domain name to resolve server errors. For an additional 16 sites, we manually edited the URL to get to a working page. In some cases, we fixed a typo, in others, we visited the broker’s main site and found the correct link by navigating to it.

Adela de la Torre
Adela de la Torre is president of San Diego State University, which last week launched a STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) training facility in Imperial County.


Welcome to California’s “Lithium Valley,” where infighting, hyper-regulation and litigation run as deep as the estimated 18 million metric tons of lithium sitting beneath the arid landscape. Here, collective dysfunction may prevent a state in financial difficulty from seizing an opportunity potentially worth more than half a trillion dollars. 
What began as a generational opportunity for the region’s economy and for America’s green energy independence has turned into a stalled quagmire of empty promises, paralyzing self-interests and unfulfilled progress. 
Today the many players involved — environmental activists, community groups, elected representatives and private enterprises — stand at a crossroads. They can continue down the divergent paths that have yielded nothing, arguing over regulation, or they can come together and share in the rich economic and environmental rewards offered by this buried treasure. 
Lithium is a vital component in renewable energy technology, and we have long known that there is a rich deposit underground near the Salton Sea. In 2022, the U.S. Department of Energy said Lithium Valley was “powering our clean energy transition,” while Gov. Gavin Newsom called the area “the Saudi Arabia of lithium” and made it an important part of that year’s budget. 
Only in late 2023 did researchers discover the true scope and magnitude of the deposit. Soaring new estimates said there were 18 million metric tons of lithium available, or enough to produce over 375 million electric vehicle batteries, worth an estimated $540 billion.
It is a massive opportunity to boost renewable energy and enhance energy independence for a nation that has had to import as much as three-quarters of our lithium in recent years. And it is an economic opportunity to invigorate Imperial County, where 17% of people live in poverty and 17% are unemployed, more than triple the state average. 
Sadly though, Lithium Valley has thus far generated more unfulfilled plans and lawsuits than EV batteries. 
California’s latest economic blueprint calls out critical minerals as an economic sector the state will “bet” on, and it has already invested well over $100 million. Yet businesses that committed to the effort are reconsidering their plans as progress stagnates. The industry’s attention and resources are being redirected to smaller lithium deposits in more progress-friendly states, including Nevada, Texas, Arizona and Arkansas.
This month, San Diego State University opened a new, state-funded $80 million STEM facility to provide training that will empower the people of Imperial County to reap the benefits of the “white gold” in their backyard. But unless progress in Lithium Valley accelerates rapidly, these students will graduate into an empty local job market.
Each new lawsuit, policy and delay pushes the realization of Lithium Valley’s promise further over the horizon. As we are already seeing, the ramp-up process can take years, during which customers will solidify their supply chains in other regions, and it will become even harder and more expensive for us to compete. Costs will continue to rise and a 10% tax credit for companies that extract, refine and recycle critical minerals like lithium will be gone by 2034.
Lithium Valley could prove that California really is open for business, and that sustainability and environmental stewardship can actually coexist with job growth and prosperity. It could be a national model for efficient, sustainable and locally driven development.
Clean energy, national security and local and statewide prosperity are at our fingertips. But that vision will slip away if the many players involved cannot harness these collective interests, commit to collaborate and prove our ability to succeed.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/020423-Geothermal-Lithium-AD-CM-03.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-12 08:56:16.852124

The losses are already mounting",Malena Carollo,,,,,https://calmatters.org/economy/2025/08/diablo-canyon-loan/,Gov. Gavin Newsom assured lawmakers federal funds would eventually cover a $1.4 billion loan to keep the Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant open. They could fall $588 million short.,"In summary
Gov. Gavin Newsom assured lawmakers federal funds would eventually cover a $1.4 billion loan to keep the Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant open. They could fall $588 million short.


Two weeks before the 2022 legislative session ended, Gov. Gavin Newsom’s administration came to lawmakers with a big ask: authorize a $1.4 billion state loan to keep open California’s last nuclear power plant, Diablo Canyon. The money was supposed to be a stopgap that would be fully repaid by an expected federal award. There was even a fail-safe: if the award fell short, other federal funds or profits from Diablo Canyon’s final year could cover the difference. 
The bill passed.
Despite promises from Newsom’s administration and legislators at the time, CalMatters found the state may be required to forgive as much as $588 million, about 42% of the loan. 
That’s partly because the maximum available federal award would never have covered the full loan. PG&E applied for even less than was available because an incentive fee allowed under the 2022 law isn’t eligible for federal reimbursement. 
One source of funding that could make up the difference—profit from the plant—is, by PG&E projections, unlikely to materialize. The only other avenue the state is considering—using federal money for nuclear waste storage—would cover a fraction of the shortfall and may not be legal. 
And the total is still mounting: PG&E said in a January filing that it expects its costs for the plant to exceed the state’s loan. 
The shortfall is emerging at a time when the state’s general fund is already facing a $12 billion budget hole, and advocates, lawmakers and regulators have raised concerns about portions of the loan benefiting PG&E shareholders, which the law forbids.
“It’s not a loan,” Matthew Freedman, lawyer for The Utility Reform Network, said. “It’s a gift.”
Diablo Canyon’s expensive new lease on life
Diablo Canyon is currently slated to stay open until 2030, five years after it was originally scheduled to shut down for economic reasons. The lifespan extension is meant to provide energy stability while California transitions to all-renewable sources by 2045. About 8% of California’s total energy comes from the San Luis Obispo County plant, as well as 17% of its carbon-free energy.
“It’s not a loan. It’s a gift.”Matthew Freedman, lawyer,  The Utility Reform Network, on California state loan of $1.4 billion to PG&E to keep the Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant operating
Newsom’s administration and other proponents of the loan said it would be paid back fully with funding from the U.S. Department of Energy’s “Civil Nuclear Credit” program, an initiative by former President Joe Biden aimed at keeping open financially ailing nuclear power plants. 
Ana Matosantos, Newsom’s cabinet secretary at the time, testified before the state Assembly in August 2022 that the administration believed the funding “will offset the entirety of the loan.” Santa Cruz Democratic Sen. John Laird, a key vote to pass the bill, echoed this in a statement:
“The $1.4 billion loan expenditure will be matched with $1.4 billion in federal revenue, which limits the requirement of any ratepayer or taxpayer money for that purpose,” he said in September that year. 
But the federal award couldn’t have covered the full loan, CalMatters found. By law, the Department of Energy can only award $1.2 billion each cycle  – $200 million less than the general fund loan. And after the bill passed, PG&E applied for even less – $1.1 billion. 
The gulf of $300 million between the state loan and Department of Energy funds is money allowed under the 2022 law that rewards PG&E for keeping the plant online. The fee is not eligible for reimbursement under the Department of Energy nuclear credit program since it does not go into the cost of running the plant. 
The Department of Energy eventually approved the funding, but that doesn’t mean the state will get the full $1.1 billion. It is made up of a base award of $741.4 million and can go up to $1.1 billion if certain conditions are met by the end of 2026. Those conditions include expenses from unexpected outages, emergencies or new and unanticipated compliance requirements by the end of 2026, according to its agreement with the Department of Energy. 
Todd Allen, chair of the University of Michigan’s department of nuclear engineering and radiological sciences, said that the latter two conditions – emergencies and new compliance requirements – are unlikely. Emergencies are rare, and new compliance requirements are uncommon. More likely, he said, are unexpected outages. But those have been relatively uncommon at the plant – Diablo Canyon has had five unexpected outages in the past 10 years, the most recent in March 2024, according to reports filed with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. PG&E said it does not currently anticipate any unexpected outages.
“I would expect, if I was asked to bet on this, that the government payoff would be closer to the lower number,” said Allen.

The California Department of Water Resources was assigned to disburse the loan to PG&E and ensure that the funds were used for authorized costs. In a February report to the Legislature, the water agency said it expected at least the guaranteed amount of the federal funding to be used to repay the loan, but “at this point DWR is not able to forecast how much of the loan will be repaid.” It won’t know for sure until the Department of Energy begins to release the money in coming years.
One way the shortfall could be made up, according to the loan agreement, is through profit from the plant in its final year of operation – November 2029 to November 2030. The 2022 law defines this as “market revenues exceeding costs and expenses.” But PG&E doesn’t currently expect to have money to spare from the plant during that period. In its most recent projections, the company anticipates that its costs for Diablo Canyon will exceed the revenue from selling its energy on the wholesale market, leaving customers with a requirement to pay the difference. 
PG&E spokesperson Jennifer Robison did not directly answer questions about the plant’s projected financial performance. Instead, she said the plant would “provide an annual $540 million net cost benefit,” in large part through its resource adequacy contribution, a state requirement that each utility be able to generate enough energy to meet customer demand. 
In other words, Diablo Canyon could help state utilities avoid running out of power and having to buy it at higher prices, saving them hundreds of millions of dollars. Robison declined to answer further questions about this, including whether that benefit could be used to pay off the loan, and if so how much of it. 
The California Public Utilities Commission, PG&E’s regulator, said the resource adequacy figure PG&E referenced is not part of the cost of running the plant, thus is not included in profit calculations. It is “more accurately described,” commission spokesperson Adam Cranfill said, as “an avoided cost.”  
The other possible source for repayment is unspecified federal funds, which the law said PG&E is required to “take all necessary steps to secure.” The water department’s February projections said the most likely source for this is payment PG&E expects to receive for storing spent nuclear fuel. Because the federal government did not build a promised national repository for the fuel, the Department of Energy pays to have it stored elsewhere until a national facility is built. PG&E expects to receive about $63 million from this from 2026 to 2030. 
These funds, however, have historically been used to offset ratepayer costs. The 2022 law authorizing the state loan to PG&E specifies that “ratepayer funds shall not otherwise be used in any manner to repay the loan.” When asked how using these funds for the loan fits within the law, water department spokesperson Ryan Endean said the spent fuel money isn’t accounted for in any other ratemaking processes. Experts CalMatters reached out to were divided on whether these funds would count as ratepayer funds. Should they be allowed, they alone would not be enough to cover the difference between the state’s loan and the federal award.
Aggrieved legislators and ‘no leverage left’ over PG&E
PG&E did not answer CalMatters’ questions about what other federal funds it is pursuing to repay the loan. When describing how the loan could be paid back, Robison omitted other federal funds as a source that could be used for this.
Lawmakers raised concerns about whether the loan would be fully repaid as soon as the legislation was introduced. 
Sen. Scott Wiener, the San Francisco Democrat who chairs the state’s joint legislative budget committee, sent a series of letters to the California Department of Finance early last year requesting more information about the loan and its repayment, expressing dissatisfaction at the lack of details available. 
“Given the condition of the general fund, we believe it is poor financial judgment to provide a loan of this magnitude to an investor-owned utility without having basic loan repayment information,” Wiener said in a March 2024 letter. At the time, the water department had not seen a copy of the funding agreement between PG&E and the federal government, according to the finance department.
“It’s another thing that undermines public trust.”Tasha Boerner, San Diego Democratic Assemblymember, on issues with PG&E’s loan
Wiener’s committee attempted to stop the final installment of the loan from being given to PG&E last year, striking it from the budget. But less than a week later, it was added back with a new requirement for the water department to submit biannual reports about the loan’s repayment. 
“The state has no leverage left to hold over PG&E,” David Weisman, executive director of the Alliance for Nuclear Responsibility.
San Diego Democratic Assemblymember Tasha Boerner, who voted against the 2022 legislation, said “it’s another thing that undermines public trust.”
“Had we gone through the normal process in January, even if it was a special session in January to fast-track it and have that time to do the hearings, to do that due diligence,” she said, it “would have made a lot of people more comfortable.”
If no federal funds are found outside of the Department of Energy award and Diablo Canyon does not have additional revenue in its final year to pay the remaining loan, the state may be required to forgive any unpaid amount. Its contract with PG&E specifies that those three categories are the only sources of funding that can be used to repay the loan. 
Laird, who voted in favor of the 2022 bill, said having to forgive a portion of the loan would be “a big deal because that’s not the intent of the bill.’
“However much they [receive] short of $1.4 billion, we will be asking how that’s going to be made back without going on the taxpayers or the ratepayers,” he said. “We sort of set a standard, and we’re going to work to make sure they meet it.’As long as the loan funds are spent, PG&E isn’t on the hook for repaying any of the loan itself. 
PG&E expects to have spent those funds and more. 
The company forecasts overspending the loan by about $157 million through next year, according to a January filing in an unrelated lawsuit. When asked if that was still the company’s current forecast, PG&E said it is “actively working to implement its Diablo Canyon extended operations transition costs in alignment with the loan amount,” declining to provide a specific figure.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/080825-Diablo-Canyon-BB-Getty-01-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-12 08:56:16.852124

Trump’s spending bill includes cuts to Medicaid, food assistance and more. But it also increases a federal tax credit that helps build affordable housing in California.


California lawmakers are preparing for a historic surge in federal funding for affordable housing construction, a tsunami of subsidy that advocates say could as much as double the number of low-rent units produced by the state over the next decade.
It comes from an unlikely source.
Buried deep among the cuts to social services in President Donald Trump’s signature spending package, the One Big Beautiful Bill, is an increase in support for the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit that affordable housing advocates have sought for years. Those tax credits are the most important federal funding available for affordable housing, and they’re used in low-income projects throughout California. 
Exactly how much difference this boost will make in the Golden State depends on many factors, including tariffs, labor costs, state funding, and more. But experts agree the change could help California build thousands more affordable homes each year. 
“It’s a very big deal,” said Matt Schwartz, president and CEO of the affordable housing nonprofit California Housing Partnership. “These provisions are a huge shot in the arm for an affordable housing field that has been suffering under exhausted state resources.”
It’s no wonder those provisions haven’t gotten much public attention. The federal law, which Trump signed on July 4, extends and expands tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the richest and adds trillions to the federal debt while imposing historic spending cuts to Medicaid, other patches of the social safety net and clean energy programs over the next decade. For California’s Democratic leadership and its liberal-leaning electorate, there isn’t much to love and plenty to hate.
“From a California perspective, there have certainly been a lot of concerns with that bill,” said Ray Pearl, executive director of the California Housing Consortium, which advocates for affordable housing development. 
But the spending package gives affordable housing boosters something to celebrate, even if many in blue California are reluctant to do so publicly. 
Because the expansion to the tax credit program, part of a preexisting bill, was folded into the broader package, “the federal government has given us a green light to double production,” said Pearl. 
Last week, the state committee that oversees these credits approved changes to its application process that incentivize developers to take advantage of the new federal policy.
What exactly do tax credits have to do with affordable housing? 
“It’s a very big deal.”Matt Schwartz, President and CEO, California Housing Partnership
Rather than fund public housing construction directly like it used to, the federal government rerouted most of its affordable housing funds through the tax code beginning in the 1980s. These tax credits are issued by states to affordable developers, who then sell them on to deep-pocketed banks, insurance companies and other financial behemoths, trading tax cuts for ownership shares in affordable housing projects.  
It’s a financial Rube Goldberg machine, and it’s everywhere. If there’s an apartment project designated for unhoused people or low-income tenants in your neighborhood, chances are tax credits helped get it off the ground. 
The credits come in two basic flavors. Both are getting a major boost under the new federal law.
One credit lets its owners write roughly 9% of the cost of construction on a project off their tax bill each year for 10 years. Those 9% credits are doled out by the federal government to the states, who then turn around and award them to developers. There are always more qualifying projects than there are credits to fund them, especially in California. The Trump-backed spending package boosts the total number of these credits by 12% each year indefinitely. 
The other type of credit, the 4% credit, doesn’t come with a cap, which means it is technically available to any developer who qualifies. How a developer qualifies is the rub. Historically, an affordable project needs to cover half of its costs with particular tax-exempt bonds — which, like the 9% credits, are in short supply — to make full use of the 4% credits. The federal bill reduces that requirement, so that a project only needs to cover a quarter of its cost with the bonds. 
“The bottom line is the federal government is making additional tax credits and bond capacity available,” Pearl said, “which is one of the biggest things you need to produce affordable housing nationwide, and especially in California.”
The state receives more requests for bond financing each year than it can grant, said Marina Wiant, executive director of the California Tax Credit Allocation Committee. Her committee last week voted to change its application to line up with the new federal requirements — reducing the percentage of a new project that must be financed via bonds, and allowing projects already approved to reduce their bond financing. That lower threshold means there will be more bond money to go around, and more projects will get funded, she said. 
“There are a lot of projects still in the queue that are waiting for bond financing,” Wiant said. “So this immediate change will have a pretty immediate impact this fall.”
How did this affordable housing boost get into Trump’s spending plan in the first place?
Schwartz’s group and others have been fighting for this tax credit increase for years, garnering bipartisan support along the way, he said. Republican lawmakers tend to view tax credits as a “good kind of subsidy,” he said. Because they are used by corporations, they are more palatable than food stamps and other direct assistance that are viewed as handouts.
Just how much could these new tax credits help? That depends on who you ask. 
The changes in policy could fund the construction of an extra 1.22 million affordable rental units nationwide over the next 10 years, according to an estimate by the accounting firm Novogradac. That works out to roughly 20,000 extra units per year in California.
But many things could get in the way. If the cost of building goes up because of tariffs, increased labor costs or interest rate hikes, developers might decide not to use the tax credits. Trump’s spending package also keeps corporate tax rates low, which could reduce the value of the housing tax credits.
And, because housing is so expensive to build in California, most projects can’t rely solely on tax credits — they need other local and state funding, too. But that funding is in short supply. Extra money given out during the COVID-19 pandemic has dried up. A statewide $20 billion affordable housing bond was set to go before voters last year, but it was pulled off the ballot amid fears it would fail. 
As a result, Schwartz estimates California will see closer to 10,000 new low-income homes built per year as a result of these extra tax credits, not 20,000.
“I think it’s going to take us a couple of years to ramp up,” he said.
Another potential obstacle: The cuts Trump’s spending package imposes on other areas — including the cuts to Medicaid that are expected to result in 3.4 million Californians losing coverage over the next 10 years — could exacerbate poverty for many people and undermine the benefits of the tax credits. 
“It’s a tremendous irony,” Schwartz said, “that (the tax credit increase) was in this incredibly harmful ‘big ugly bill,’ as we call it.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/020624_No-Place-Like-Home_CC_CM_12.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-12 08:56:16.852124

California lawmakers have spoken on average for more than six hours this year. Others have said comparatively little. How effective can you be if you stay silent?


Most California lawmakers love to talk, but some hardly say a word. 
Since the legislative session began in December, the average lawmaker has spoken for 6.3 hours. But eight lawmakers have talked for around an hour or less – six of them Republicans, who are a superminority in the Legislature, according to a CalMatters Digital Democracy analysis.
Quiet Republicans include a trio of assemblymembers from Orange County and a north state senator. Two other quiet Republicans represent competitive Assembly swing districts in the Inland Empire. A pair of Democratic assemblymembers – one from the San Joaquin Valley, the other representing the Chino area – also have been keeping their thoughts mostly to themselves this year.
“I don’t waste time on performative politics,” Orange County Republican Kate Sanchez said in an emailed statement. “If more of my colleagues did the same, we would have significantly more productive conversations at the Capitol.”
Sanchez spoke for just over an hour so far this year. Many of her remarks were on her short-lived bill that sought to prevent transgender students from participating on a girls interscholastic sports team.
The striking differences in speaking are found in the CalMatters Digital Democracy database, which tracks every word spoken during public hearings in the California Legislature. 
But does talking equal effectiveness? Not necessarily.
A Digital Democracy analysis found no link between speaking time and whether a lawmaker’s bills got signed into law during the last two-year session.
That doesn’t surprise Thad Kousser, a former legislative staffer and political science professor at UC San Diego.
“That kid who always has his hands up in class may not always be the one everyone listens to,” Kousser said. 
Does talking make lawmakers effective?
Instead, success seems mostly to be about the types of bills lawmakers introduce rather than how much they talk about them. Lawmakers from both parties who regularly author controversial legislation are less likely to see theirs pass, regardless of how much they talk about them. 
Personalities and relationships with colleagues matter, too.One example: Bill Essayli, a firebrand Republican representing the Corona area, often spoke critically of Democrats in speeches that made him the eighth-most talkative among the 26 Republicans last session. 
None of his bills passed. Like his fiery floor speeches, many of Essayli’s bills were intended to score points with his Republican base. Democrats who control the Legislature killed them out of spite, even the few that weren’t particularly controversial.
By comparison, Sen. Megan Dahle, representing the Redding area, had the highest bill success among Republicans, despite being the third-quietest member of the Legislature last session.
Members of both parties like Dahle personally. Her bills also tend not to be particularly controversial. They typically focus on local issues important to her constituents.

But that doesn’t mean speaking isn’t an important political consideration for lawmakers, Kousser said.
“No legislator is convinced to vote ‘yes’ on a bill because of a floor speech,” he said. “A floor speech doesn’t change people’s minds about a bill; it changes people’s minds about a legislator. Who is this person? What do they stand for?” 
Case in point: Democrats may have killed all of Essayli’s bills, but his speeches critical of Democrats made for a steady stream of social media and news clips that caught the attention of those in President Donald Trump’s orbit. This spring, Essayli quit the Legislature after Trump’s attorney general, Pam Bondi, made Essayli the interim U.S. Attorney for Los Angeles.
Fresno’s quiet lawmaker says he’s effective 
Fresno Democratic Assemblymember Joaquin Arambula has spoken for 55 minutes so far this year and has been significantly quieter than he was last session.
But he challenged whether his speaking rate was an accurate reflection of his involvement and impact in the Legislature. 
“The original number of words spoken means very little to me as I think you can get more across in fewer words and be just as effective as those who speak more,” Arambula said in an interview with CalMatters’ reporting partner, Fresnoland. “So I don’t put any weight or validity toward that number at all.”
Arambula said he has avoided not becoming less engaged in the Legislature after Speaker Robert Rivas removed him from the Assembly’s health committee. Arambula had discussed challenging Rivas for the leadership seat. Arambula, an emergency room doctor, has filed to run for a Fresno City Council seat in 2026.

Arambula said speaking is less important than what lawmakers do for their communities. 
“I have a responsibility to make sure that our community is represented well,” Arambula said. “I believe you do that most effectively by returning resources.”
Arambula said he played a key role, despite a tough budget year, in Gov. Gavin Newsom including $100 million for infrastructure in Fresno’s downtown and Chinatown as part of a $300 million commitment. Newsom paused state funding for the city’s infrastructure last year.
“No one else was able to return resources for their community like we were,” Arambula said. 
Quiet lawmakers unavailable for interviews
Perhaps not surprisingly, the other quiet lawmakers either didn’t respond to interview requests, or their spokespeople replied with emailed statements.
Republican Assemblymember Greg Wallis, who won his Inland Empire Assembly seat in 2022 by one of the smallest margins in state history, has largely stayed silent on the dais since. So far this year, he’s talked for 38 minutes. 
“I love the irony of chasing the quiet Assemblymembers for an interview,” Wallis spokesperson Colin Hawley said in an email. “Greg is all about consistency, so in this instance, he’s choosing to keep his words few and let his votes do the talking.”
The most silent by far is Sen. Dahle. She talked for just seven minutes so far this year. Never particularly chatty on the dais to begin with, Dahle had a stroke in late 2023. It’s now difficult for her to form words, so she mostly stays quiet.
After taking time off to recover, Dahle gave a brief floor speech last August while still a member of the Assembly.
“Speaking’s hard, but I’m doing it,” she said, while fighting back tears. 
This year, much of the seven minutes Dahle spoke were on the Senate floor during another emotional speech supporting a stroke resolution.
In an emailed statement, Dahle said she has “that much more time to listen and to discern what is good for my north state constituents and what is not” when she’s not speaking in hearings.
She said she is still fighting on issues such as wolf attacks on livestock, illegal marijuana growing and the state’s rural water supply.

Democratic Assemblymember Michelle Rodriguez, elected last year to represent the Chino area, spoke for only 34 minutes. A spokesperson said she was too busy for a phone interview last week while the session is on summer recess. 
A spokesperson for Assemblymember Leticia Castillo, a Corona-area Republican who has talked for 52 minutes since narrowly winning her Assembly seat last year, didn’t return messages.
Spokespeople for Orange County Republicans Tri Ta, who spoke for 65 minutes, and Phillip Chen who spoke for 28, also didn’t return interview requests.
Former Stockton-area Democratic Sen. Susan Talamantes Eggman, who termed out of the Legislature last year, said some of the most persuasive lawmakers are those who provide thoughtful commentary at the right moment instead of blabbing all the time.
“If you’re just talking to have words, quickly you’re going to get eye rolls, and people drift away,” she said. “People don’t listen if you’re just talking.”

Jon Lines
5/24/1963 – 8/8/2025


Jon Lines passed to the beyond in the early morning hour on August 8th after a brief struggle with a hard illness. Surrounded by family, friends, and a soundtrack curated by siblings, cousins, nieces and nephews, he left this world with the love and care he brought to it.
Growing up in the South End of Burlington, in a neighborhood full of adventure and endless days of fun, Jon was the oldest of the Lines siblings born to Stratty and Beverly.
Down on South Cove, between Red Rocks Park and Oakledge in the 70/80s, some of the most epic games of 4 Square, Witch, and Prison Ball would ensue among the dozens of kids throughout the neighborhood.
And of course, there were also days of hanging out and eating at the family business, the Oasis Diner on Bank Street downtown.
Like so many generations of Greek diner families, Jon started working at the Oasis in his early teens and then branched out for a time and got a commercial drivers license. For a few years, he drove trucks for Merrill Transport, until the Oasis beckoned (Stratty needed a reliable cook) and he and his father forged a path that countless family businesses had trod before. Jon’s tireless work ethic, skills at the grill, and gift for gab made him a natural.
In the mid nineties Jon took over the Oasis and was joined by brother David to run the show for a decade. After selling the business in 2007, he went to work for Barrett Trucking. The Barretts had been part of the extended diner family and Jon became an indispensable member of the team until his recent illness. In these years, he was living a little kid’s dream of driving trucks and tractors for a living.
He was especially proud and always ready – no matter the time of day or number of hours behind the wheel – to aid in the now-annual flood recovery in Vermont, as Barrett trucks have become a key component of recovery efforts.
Jon is pre-deceased by his mother and father, Bev and Stratty, and his Uncle Chris, who helped manage the diner for many years and was an essential part of the fabric of Church Street. He is survived by brothers Gary and David, sister Maria, and their partners; his five nieces and nephews to whom he was a wonderful uncle; several close cousins; and a host of friends, including his crew at the Pour House and the Pub.
The family would like to extend deep gratitude to all the staff and medical professionals of UVMMC. Their dedication, care, understanding, and vast well of integrity will be forever appreciated.

(Photo by Alon Skuy/Getty Images)The Nevada Republican Party thinks the state should build its own high-security immigration detention center and name it “Coyote Compound.”
The party sent a fundraising email Aug. 8 asking if Nevada should follow Florida’s example and construct its own detention facility.
“Florida has Alligator Alcatraz — a high-security ICE detention center designed to detain and process illegal immigrants quickly and efficiently,” reads the email. “Now, we’re asking: Should Nevada have something similar? We’re calling it the Coyote Compound, and it would send a clear message: Nevada takes border security seriously.”
After the email heavily suggests what readers’ answers should be, the email urges readers to click a link to take a poll. And after submitting their preference for the “Coyote Compound” (“Yes,” “No,” or “I’m not sure”) readers are directed to a page where they’re invited to donate money to the party.
The state Republican Party, which did not respond to a request for comment, may have been more focused on raising money for itself instead of actually galvanizing government and community support for construction of a much-maligned — and expensive — detention camp. 
The detention center in Florida’s Everglades was opened last month. The hastily built facility, which is expected to hold up to 5,000 beds, has been heavily criticized for abhorrent conditions, a lack of transparency concerning practices and detainees, and environmental concerns. 
The ACLU has also warned of reports where people who are detained there “are fed maggot-infested food, denied medical care, not given access to water, flushing toilets, or showers, and are not allowed to go outside.”
Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis authorized $245 million in funding, provided by Florida taxpayers, to get the facility up and running.
Nevada Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo and Republican state Senate Minority Leader Robin Titus did not respond to requests for comment.
“The crisis at the border isn’t just a border state problem anymore, it’s a national emergency, and Nevada needs to be part of the solution,” the Nevada Republican Party asserted in its email.
That claim seems to be at odds with Trump, who recently asserted “We now have the most secure border in modern American history.”
The email from the state Republican Party advocating a Florida-style immigration detention camp happened to be sent the same day Lombardo confirmed he would authorize the Nevada National Guard to assist with President Donald Trump’s mass deportation agenda. 
Laura Martin, the executive director of the Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada and a steering committee member of the Nevada Immigrant Coalition decried the Republican Party’s push, even if only in a fundraising email, for a “Coyote Compound.” 
“Joe Lombardo is the de facto leader of the Nevada Republican party and this kind of violent, racist rhetoric is exactly what is taking our state down a path of economic collapse,” Martin said. “Nevadans deserve strong leadership that respects all residents, not culture war-chasing gimmicks designed to remind people why our nickname is the Mississippi of the West.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/alligatoralcatraz-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-12 08:56:16.852124

However, that growth hasn’t been enough to bridge the marked gender disparity in science, technology, engineering and math, a report from Utah State University’s Utah Women and Leadership Project says. 
Women’s participation in STEM fields in Utah has increased from 17.1% in 2015 to 24% in 2023. That, in researchers’ books, represents a win. The number, however, lags behind other growth metrics those industries have shown nationwide.
“Utah has made progress in the last few years in decreasing occupational segregation (the disparity between the number of women and men in a field or industry) in STEM,” the report says. “However, there still are far more men in STEM occupations than women, and Utah is behind the nation in this domain.”

While Salt Lake City ranks No. 12  on the list of best cities for STEM jobs in the country, according to the financial consultant WalletHub, Utah’s capital is only the 35th best for “STEM-friendliness.” That’s a score partially determined by the disparity of women versus men in STEM occupations and degree fields, according to the report.
Utah women made up 24% of the state’s STEM workforce in 2023, up from the 20.9% recorded in 2019, a number that Kolene Anderson, associate director at the Utah Women and Leadership Project, celebrated. But, that’s still not proportionate with the general growth of STEM occupations in the state, which was 17.7% from 2019 to 2023. 
Because women are less likely to pursue STEM education, they are less likely to be in these fields that are associated with high growth and high wages, Anderson said. But also, with technologies like artificial intelligence emerging, diversity in that workforce is essential to help solve challenges with discrimination and sexism that have occurred in the past, she said.
“As technology advances, as social challenges become more complex, we need women in those spaces as well to talk about potential solutions,” Anderson said, “just so that we can be more inclusive.”



Let us know what you think...


 


Women and men don’t significantly differ in their math and science abilities. But, they do have different levels of interest, confidence and sense of belonging in the STEM industry, researchers wrote. 
“This disparity is caused by several factors, including the lack of female role models, bias in the industry, and pressure to balance life and work, to name a few,” according to the brief. 
Utah girls consistently score lower in math benchmark exams than boys in 4th and 8th grades, according to the report. That, Anderson said, influences whether or not girls have the confidence and interest to pursue careers in STEM fields.
“I believe that is a very ingrained cultural, social thing. How do we figure out exactly what the cause of that is? That’s complex,” Anderson said. “But I suspect, and I think most researchers suspect, that it’s more of a social challenge to resolve. It’s not a capability issue, it’s a social issue.”
Mixed messages 
Added to this mix is what Anderson describes as “mixed messages” from the Utah Legislature.
In 2024, the state passed a law restricting diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in public entities, limiting programs based on “personal identity characteristics,” including gender. That same year, the Legislature also approved a non-binding resolution promoting opportunities for women in STEM.
With cuts of federal funding for gender research, the scenario has become even more confusing and frustrating, she said, especially since research shows that “having a watered down version of supporting everybody is less effective than targeting specific initiatives where you’re trying to get women or minorities involved in STEM.”
This year, the state also approved a law requiring public universities to cut 10% of their budgets for courses, aiming to step away from “inefficient” programs and invest more in high-demand degrees. Lawmakers often listed some STEM jobs as careers they would like to propel as part of the budget restructuring — a positive approach, in Anderson’s perspective.
“But I hope that in the process, the sentiment of that joint resolution that they passed last year doesn’t get lost,” Anderson said. Especially, when including more women in these fields is both good for innovation, the economy, and Utah women, girls and their families.

(John R. Roby for Alabama Reflector)HUNTSVILLE – Surrounded by the materiel of missile defense – sensors, circuits and rocket motor mockups – four of the nearly 10,000 military and civilian professionals of the space and defense community who convened here last week pondered a side question.
Why did the Space and Missile Defense Symposium make so little mention of “Golden Dome for America,” President Donald Trump’s missile defense initiative that has been described as a “Manhattan Project-level effort”?
In one of his first actions after taking office in January, Trump called for a renewed focus on missile defense, including a network of space-based sensors and interceptors that harkened back to President Ronald Reagan’s Strategic Defense Initiative. Trump has said the effort will cost $175 billion and be “fully operational” by the end of his term.
During the Space and Missile Defense symposium last week, the industry’s message was clear: Alabama stands to gain through this new investment. But what remains murky is the extent that Trump’s callback to Reagan’s “Star Wars” initiative will pay dividends in the Rocket City – or anywhere else.
Critics have called the president’s timetable overly ambitious, and the Congressional Budget Office has estimated the cost at a half-trillion dollars over 20 years.
About $25 billion has been appropriated so far, though specific programs were not designated by Congress. The Pentagon’s Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is working on two multibillion-dollar contracting vehicles around Golden Dome, the larger of which is still in the presolicitation phase.
Publicly and privately, industry executives are signaling that Alabama might benefit most from a more down-to-Earth version of the president’s vision.
Raymond Sharp, who as vice president of missile defense solutions for Northrop Grumman leads up that company’s Huntsville-based Golden Dome efforts, described the initial push as scaling existing capacity and ensuring various systems can sync up in ways they were not necessarily designed to do.
“Golden Dome is missile defense on a massive scale, but I think our industry is ready for this moment,” he said. “There’ll be new capabilities required, but we’ll also be employing our existing capabilities in new and different ways: layering and integrating like never seen before.”
Yet while industry executives spent three days in Huntsville’s Von Braun Center telling the military’s missile defense leaders and procurement professionals they were ready with solutions, the Pentagon often played defense.
“We’ve been told every year that we’ve been in existence that it’ll never work, you’re not doing it right, and you probably spent too much money and shouldn’t exist,” Lt. Gen Heath Collins, MDA director, said in a Thursday spech to close the symposium.
Minutes later, he said he would not be answering questions from the audience or the media.
“In the last six months I’ve walked into many, many rooms and said, ‘I can’t take questions on You Know What,’ and I’ve never received a question other than something about You Know What,” he said. “So let’s just avoid that.”

Dare not speak its name

Collins was referring to the central paradox of this year’s SMD: At an event where Golden Dome loomed large, Pentagon officials were reportedly ordered to avoid mentioning it.
The symposium itself had to play catchup. A panel titled “Golden Dome for America” was scrubbed just before the conference began, with the conference website stating, “Information regarding Golden Dome for America will be promulgated by the government.”
That took the form of a separate session for industry leaders after the symposium wrapped. Despite being unclassified, the session was closed to media.
In a sense, it was standard fare for the Von Braun Center’s concert hall, where theater and fantasy routinely play out in a venue named for a rocket pioneer. For three days, Golden Dome was The Scottish Play.
So Collins referred not to Golden Dome but to “the return of priority and focus on the missile defense enterprise … within the past six months” and to the, “new imperative to bring a national capability to bear” on missile defense. Another MDA official spoke of the “policy changes [included in] the president’s January executive order.”
“That was the change from a focus on rogue states such as Iran and North Korea and a focus on peers and near-peers,” said Dan Poskey, director of program management and integration, space capabilities for the Missile Defense Agency. “Now we’re looking at threat sets associated with China and Russia, and it really changes the paradigm.”

The golden road

Absent a clear signal from government, executives of the nation’s largest defense contractors stuck to the tried-and-true this week in Huntsville.
And in truth, missile defense is having a moment.
“Everybody’s eyes were opened [during the] war between Iran and Israel,” said Stan Stafira, chief architect with the Missile Defense Agency. 
The community took notice, he said, of the sheer number of ballistic missiles that required interdiction – more than 500 in a 12-day span – as well as the massive, long-range drone strikes of the Russia-Ukraine war. Both conflicts have driven home the importance of layered engagement: Different missile defense systems must have overlapping coverage so the right tool can be used when needed.
“No single system will be able to handle it all,” Stafira said.
The United States’ existing ballistic missile defense consists of four main interdiction systems, supported by multiple sensors and command and control infrastructures. Three of them – Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense and Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) – have been combat-tested in Israel, Ukraine or both in the past year.
All three are mobile, with Aegis launched from U.S. Navy vessels, and THAAD and PAC-3 from truck-mounted launchers. The fourth, Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD), launches interceptor missiles from fixed silos in Alaska and California. All four address missile threats at different ranges and stages of flight; when combined, they are said to be “layered.”
That combination, though, has historically not been a priority for homeland missile defense, which has been focused on stopping a small-scale launch from a rogue adversary like North Korea.
Johnathon Caldwell, vice president and general manager of strategic missile defense systems for Lockheed Martin, said his company, as the prime contractor for THAAD, Aegis and PAC-3, is “on the front lines” of defending U.S. and allied forces in global hotspots.
“All of these things are happening because we have a layered defense of capabilities … connected by command and control,” he said.
That, in turn, is a model for Golden Dome, he said – layered missile defense applied more systematically to the United States. He maintained it is an achievable goal.
“This is going to be an effort … where we take combat-proven technologies [and] we combine them with innovation and industrial scale partnerships,” he said. “I think we’ll get our playbook soon, [but] our job right now is to get ourselves into shape, hone our skills and build our muscles and our relationships so we can … stand up to this new scale of layered homeland defense.”
James Johnson, senior vice president for space solutions with Parsons Corp., said the key difference between existing capacity and Trump’s Golden Dome vision would come down to scale. He predicted it would initially involve “more of everything” – those interdiction, sensing and command and control systems already in use – in light of lessons from recent global conflicts.
“The president’s drawing a line in the sand for the end of his administration,” he said. “Whatever we’ve got at that point is the initial capability. It will not be perfect, but it will evolve.”

(John R. Roby for Alabama Reflector)
Alabama is positioned to be a key part of that scaling and evolution.
Industry is banking on most Golden Dome procurement dollars flowing – at least initially – into existing systems, particularly those that have been fielded successfully. And the state is already home to a vast and growing defense base that touches aspects of all U.S. missile defense systems in existence.
Misty Holmes, RTX’s vice president for shipboard missiles, said the company’s Raytheon division is seeing “strong demand focus” since the SM-3 saw its combat debut in April 2024, when they first intercepted Iranian ballistic missiles bound for Israel.
“We’re continuing to see unbelievable rates of utility in these weapons defending our sailors, our allied sailors and international allied friends … the demand signal is loud and clear,” she said.
Raytheon has been scaling up its capacity both in its own facilities and through the production chain. The company is nearing completion of a $115 million expansion of its missile integration facility on Redstone Arsenal, where the company integrates all variants of its Standard Missile family. The growth will allow it to expand production by 50% and is expected to bring 185 new jobs to the region.
Boeing is also growing its manufacturing footprint in north Alabama, with an 35,000-square-foot expansion expected to come online this year. The company makes “seekers,” or guidance systems, for the PAC-3 missile in Huntsville as a subcontractor to Lockheed Martin, and recently announced a record of over 500 deliveries in 2024. The new facility is expected to boost production by 30%.
The growth will “meet current demands of the day but also plan for the challenges we’re going to face in the future,” said Pierce Lehr, Boeing vice president for global supply chain and integration.
Josh Jackson, executive vice president of SAIC’s Army Business Group, said data will be key to making the nest of interdictors, sensors and command and control infrastructure work at scale.
The company’s Huntsville operation is its second-largest worldwide, and its focus is on data integration, or turning the riot of “noise” generated by hundreds of sources across services and platforms into a clear, actionable signal for units on the ground.
“That’s what we’ve focused on: how can you create a data fabric that allows multiple systems that usually don’t talk to each other to interoperate seamlessly so you can provide better situational awareness, [allowing for] crisper decision-making for commanders,” Jackson said.
If data is a frontier of Golden Dome, space-based interdiction is the promised land. Trump’s executive order specifically mentions it – but it’s considered the thorniest and most expensive of problems in missile defense.
Yet steps are being taken in Huntsville as well. Leidos’ Dynetics subsidiary is building the common hypersonic glide body, a housing for offensive and defensive hypersonic missiles, under a $670 million Army contract. Lockheed Martin, General Atomics and Raytheon subcontract parts of the process at several Alabama facilities.
“This system, that we’ve been working with our customers to mature and build the industrial base for, brings a lot of capability that will be increasingly important as we talk about space-based interceptors,” said Jason Morgan, vice president and CTO for Leidos.
Whether Golden Dome launches with a space-based component must wait until Trump’s end-of-term deadline. But the capacity for near-term production ramp-ups and systems integration work exists now in north Alabama – and industry has an appetite to expand it.

(Image via White House livestream)Four days before a scheduled meeting with the president of Russia, Vladimir Putin, over the possibility of a ceasefire that could pause the Russian invasion of Ukraine, President Donald Trump has yet to announce a firm location or timing.
Trump said last week on social media that he would meet Putin in Alaska on Friday.
Speaking to reporters Monday at the White House, Trump said he would seek to temporarily end the fighting that has resulted since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022.
He said he isn’t certain what a long-term peace deal would involve, but it likely would entail “some swapping … some changes in land,” he said.
“We’re going to change the lines, the battle lines. Russia has occupied a big portion of Ukraine. They’ve occupied some very prime territory. We’re going to try and get some of that territory back for Ukraine. But they’ve taken some very prime territory,” Trump said.
In a video address Sunday, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy appeared to reject the idea of surrendering land for peace, saying in part that “Ukrainians will not gift their land to the occupier.”
Zelenskyy has not been invited to Trump’s talks with Putin.
In meandering remarks Monday, Trump twice appeared to misstate the location of the expected talks, saying at one point, “We’re going to Russia,” before correctly returning to Alaska as the location. 
“I thought it was very respectful that the president of Russia is coming to our country instead of us going to his country or a third-party place. I think we’ll have constructive conversations, and then after that meeting, immediately — maybe as I’m flying out, maybe as I’m leaving the room — I’ll be calling the European leaders who I get along with very well and have a great relationship with, I think, all of them,” Trump said Monday. 
“I get along with Zelenskyy, but I disagree with what he’s done, very very severely disagree. This is a war that shouldn’t have happened … but I’ll be speaking with Zelenskyy. The next meeting will be with Zelenskyy and Putin, or Zelenskyy, Putin and me. I’ll be there if they need, but I want to have a meeting set up between the two leaders,” Trump said.
Asked what he would consider a good deal between Russia and Ukraine, the president said he hasn’t made up his mind.
“I’ll tell you after I hear what the deal is, because there could be many definitions,” Trump said.
“We’re going to have a meeting with Vladimir Putin,” he said, “and at the end of that meeting, probably in the first two minutes, I’ll know exactly whether or not a deal can be, because that’s what I do.”

Apart from persuading voters, there are looming political and legal battles.","Gov. Gavin Newsom justifies — or rationalizes — his drive for a mid-decade reconfiguration of California’s congressional districts as a heroic mission to thwart President Donald Trump’s power grab.
Newsom, who seems to be edging ever closer to a 2028 presidential campaign, proposes to alter the state’s 53 districts to shift five or six seats now held by Republicans into Democratic hands during the 2026 elections.
If successful, it would neutralize efforts by Texas Republicans to gerrymander its districts to gain a similar number of seats. Republicans hold a paper-thin majority in the House of Representatives and Trump has sought mid-decade redistricting in Texas and other red states to block Democrats from gaining control in 2026.
The Texas situation is in limbo because Democratic legislators have fled the state, but how long they can hold out is unclear. Newsom played host to some Texas Democrats last week as he talked up action in California, which would require voter approval in a November special election.
“I think the voters will approve it. I think the voters understand what’s at stake,” Newsom said on Friday. “We live in the most un-Trump state in America.”
Well maybe, but Democratic gerrymandering of California’s districts will not be as easy as Republican gerrymandering in Texas.
In Texas, as in most states, the legislature controls redistricting. Under its current maps, enacted after the 2020 census, Republicans hold 25 of its 38 seats, Democrats have 12 and there’s one vacancy.
Ironically, Democrats fare much better in Texas than Republicans do in California, where the GOP holds just nine of the state’s 53 seats under maps drawn by an independent commission. Newsom, backed by Democratic legislative leaders, wants voters to set aside the commission’s maps for as many as three election cycles and approve a new plan with more Democratic districts.
If Texas moves forward, the proposal, which has not been shared publicly, would require the California Legislature to place it on the ballot after lawmakers return next week from summer recess — and just four days to act under current law. However, the Legislature has often exempted itself from ballot measure deadlines, so one must assume that the proposal will make the ballot.
That’s the easy part for Newsom. He would still have to persuade voters who are no more than lukewarm despite the unpopularity of Trump in California, according to private polling.
Former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who championed the creation of an independent redistricting commission, says he’ll oppose Newsom’s plan and Charles Munger Jr., a wealthy scientist who bankrolled two ballot measures to create the commission, says he’ll support an opposition campaign.
Given the stakes, Trump and Republicans would probably flood the state with opposition campaign money while Democrats would do the same, with even more money coming from labor unions and other Democratic allies.
Newsom also faces the possibility of legal battles, such as issues over what data he uses to draw the new districts. 
The state commission used numbers from the 2020 census, which pegged California’s population at 39,538,223. The latest estimate from the Department of Finance’s demographic unit is 39,529,000, a tiny difference. However, there are also differences within the state, according to the state’s estimates, with coastal counties tending to lose population while inland counties gaining.
Districts must be equal in population — within tight tolerances — but also must not disenfranchise protected ethnic groups, according to federal law.
These factors all could be bases for litigation, perhaps including intervention by Trump’s Department of Justice. After the 2000 census, the threat of federal intervention played a big role in the California Legislature’s previous redistricting effort, blocking Democrats from drawing partisan maps.
Prolonged litigation could block Newsom’s plan from taking effect in 2026 even if he gains voter approval this year. This game is just beginning.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/080825-Texas-Democrats-Presser-FG-CM-14.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-12 08:56:16.852124

The seat became vacant after former Rep. Corey Harbison, R-Cullman, resigned in April. Harbison was absent for much of the 2025 legislative session.
Does the seat have a partisan lean?
District 11 is solidly Republican. Harbison took over 85% of the vote in his re-election campaign in 2022.
What issues dominate the race?
SB 322, sponsored by Sen. Jabo Waggoner, R-Vestavia Hills, was signed by Gov. Kay Ivey on May 7. The law allows the city of Cullman to annex a resort in Cullman County, a dry county, in order for the resort to serve alcohol.
The law drew criticism from Democratic and Republican candidates in this election and the House District 11 special election, scheduled for Aug. 26. Cullman County did not have representation in the House after Harbison resigned in April and Rep. Randall Shedd, R-Fairview, resigned in February to work for Senate President Pro Tem Garlan Gudger, R-Cullman.
Gudger, who co-sponsored the legislation, pre-filed a bill on Aug. 1 to repeal the law, which goes into effect on Oct. 1. Any annexation proposal would have to go through Cullman City Council, which Hollingsworth serves on. He said last week he would not support a proposal, and he and the city council president said they had not heard a proposal. Myrex, who also opposed the law, said she heard constituents’ concerns about the property being used for a casino, but Gudger added a provision to the law before final passage that prohibits such use of the property.
What happens after today?
The winner will face Democratic candidate Matthew Glover, a 40-year-old former Good Hope City councilman, on Oct. 28.

Will the results alter control of the Legislature?

No. Republicans currently hold 72 of the 105 seats in the Alabama House, after three resignations after the end of the 2025 session in May. Rep. Cynthia Almond, R-Tuscaloosa, was appointed president of the Public Service Commission in June. Rep. Matt Woods, R-Jasper, was elected to the State Senate on June 24. Rep. Debbie Wood, R-Valley, announced her resignation and move to the Florida panhandle last week. Republicans hold 27 of the 35 seats in the Alabama Senate.

Santiago/Getty Images)Only a few years after the pandemic, young kids in this country are seeing a whole new disruption to their learning: immigration raids.
One of the Trump administration’s first actions after assuming office was to rescind the Biden administration’s guidelines for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which limited enforcement activity in “sensitive locations” like schools and churches.
Since then, immigration raids have escalated — often under questionable pretenses. This spring, immigration agents tried to enter two elementary schools in Los Angeles. At the door, agents said they wanted to determine students’ well-being and claimed to have authorization from the children’s caretakers.
Administrators denied them entry — and when they spoke with caretakers later, they learned that agents had lied about receiving permission. “I’m absolutely incensed that DHS agents would try to enter elementary schools,” said Rep. Judy Chu (D-CA). “These are children who should be learning to read and write, not cowering in fear of being ripped away from their homes.”
Unfortunately, schools are no longer a safe haven for our students. You can imagine the trauma and disruption that comes from armed agents entering schools and removing students. But these raids will also have long-term implications on learning outcomes, mental health, and even school funding for children enrolled in public schools nationwide.
And we’re seeing that now in rising rates of absenteeism.
In June, Stanford professor Thomas Dee published a groundbreaking report detailing the relationship between raids and school absences. Focusing on recent raids in California’s Central Valley region, Dee studied attendance data from over three years at five nearby school districts. Dee was able to correlate raids with a 22 percent increase in student absenteeism, particularly affecting youngest learners.
In the weeks following Dee’s report, media outlets from across the county — from New York to Denver and Chicago — reported similar patterns of immigration raids leading to increased student absences. Fearful of raids, families across the nation have opted to keep their children home.
In many states, including California, school funding is determined by average daily attendance. This means that the more students miss school, the less that school will receive going forward. So when a raid forces a student to miss school, it doesn’t just impact their own learning — it also means fewer resources for their classmates, teachers, and their entire district.
This threatens the public school ecosystem, inflicting long-term harm on a generation of students already recovering from pandemic-era setbacks. “Absences are both more common for everybody, but they are also more extreme,” said Jacob Kirksey, an associate professor of education policy at Texas Tech. Raids “can essentially create what we found from COVID — this generation of students who have a patently different experience with schooling.”
Importantly, students and educators still have rights. For instance, a school district cannot ask about a student’s citizenship or immigration status as proof of that student’s residency. Students have the right to withhold this information, and schools may not prohibit that student from enrollment if they do not disclose it.
You can explore your legal protections as a student or an educator by visiting MySchoolMyRights.com, a website published by the ACLU where you’ll find clear, accessible guidance on what ICE can or can’t do in schools.
Over half of American voters believe schools should not be touched by immigration raids. They understand that ICE raids on schools don’t make communities safer. They make classrooms emptier and schools more vulnerable to funding cuts.
We must advocate on behalf of those students by demanding transparency and passing policies that limit ICE access to protect our students and families. We owe all kids a safe haven at school and the freedom to learn without fear.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2219519292-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-12 08:56:16.852124

LaMonica McIver and Rob Menendez take questions from Hudson County residents during a talk at the county's community college on Aug. 11, 2025. (Photo courtesy of McIver's office)Rep. LaMonica McIver said she will continue to fight for congressional oversight of immigration detention centers, despite facing federal charges accusing her of assaulting officers during a May visit to a migrant jail in Newark.
McIver (D-10) told the New Jersey Monitor at an event in Jersey City Monday that the case against her has been “definitely stressful.”
“When you talk about a person coming to charge you because you were there to do your job and they’re telling you you can get 17 years in prison, that’s nothing to joke with. I’m a mother, I’m a wife, I have a family,” she said. 
McIver was joined by Rep. Rob Menendez (D-08) at Hudson County Community College in Jersey City for what they billed as a dialogue series to discuss their “shared experiences and work fighting for our communities in the time of Trump.”
The two recalled an immigration raid in Newark that occurred less than 48 hours after President Donald Trump took office for his second term, along with their often confrontational visits to detention centers. 
McIver, Menendez, and Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-12) showed up at Delaney Hall, a 1,000-bed migrant detention center in Newark, on May 9 for an unannounced inspection of the facility. Their visit ended in chaos, with federal officers arresting Newark Mayor Ras Baraka and charging him with trespassing, then later charging McIver and accusing her of shoving agents as they took Baraka into custody. She pleaded not guilty, and her trial is tentatively set to begin in November (the charges against Baraka were quickly dropped).
Menendez recalled from his visit to Delaney Hall that the building was dirty, the telephones were not working, and the three members of Congress got stuck in an elevator. Baraka and other Newark officials have accused Delaney Hall’s owners, private prison firm Geo Group, of opening the facility without proper city permits and inspections.
McIver noted on Monday that after the incident at Delaney Hall made national headlines, the Department of Homeland Security attempted to stop members of Congress from making unannounced visits to immigrant detention centers by requiring them to alert the department seven days in advance. An appropriations law in effect since 2019 grants a lawmaker the ability to conduct oversight of such centers without prior approval from the department or Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
“It hasn’t changed — it’s just that the administration wants it to change, so they literally put out a guidance, but you can’t just change policy because you want to,” McIver said. “That’s not how it works.”
Menendez noted that he and other members of New Jersey’s House delegation fought federal policies on immigration under the Biden administration, too. He was among the lawmakers who signed a letter sent to then-President Biden urging him to stop fighting a New Jersey law that bars companies from contracting with ICE to detain immigrants. That law suffered a setback last month when, after a lengthy court battle, the U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that it cannot apply to private companies, paving the way for more federal detention centers to open.
“The writing was on the wall that if Trump were to win, you’re going to see the most expansive immigration enforcement policies and actions that we’ve ever seen, and that’s what’s happening today,” Menendez said.
The Trump administration is eyeing a massive camp for undocumented immigrants at Fort Dix.  
“I think they have an insatiable appetite for this, and it’s not about violent criminals,” Menendez said.

We care deeply about where and how our kids learn — and we want a say in it. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Laura Cannon: Preserve local school boards. Preserve local democracy. .","This commentary is by Laura Cannon, of Hardwick. Laura is a parent of two preschoolers, a speech-language pathologist and a member of the Rural School Community Alliance.


We won’t always agree with every decision our school boards make — but we should all agree on this: They must exist. Without them, we lose local democracy, community involvement and taxpayer oversight. 
Whether you’re from Hardwick, Newport, Wells, Brattleboro or Grand Isle, one thing is clear: Our communities value taking local responsibility for education, community-based schooling and school board representation. We care deeply about where and how our kids learn — and we want a say in it. 
The Rural Schools Community Alliance — a coalition of community and municipal groups, school boards, and educators — has fought hard to preserve these values in the current legislation. Thanks to their efforts, the new law Act 73 recognizes supervisory unions in addition to supervisory districts, giving rural voices a chance to be heard. But the Rural Schools Community Alliance cannot do this alone. Now it’s our turn.

So, what’s at stake? 
If existing school districts are eliminated and replaced by a large supervisory district — as favored by Gov. Phil Scott and Agency of Education — our local school boards would vanish. Existing articles of agreement would be dissolved. Decision-making power would shift to a distant, centralized board overseeing 4,000 to 8000 students. Town-level representation would disappear. Budget decisions and school closures would happen without a vote of the town. 
Under a supervisory union structure, by contrast, existing school boards would continue as would existing articles of agreement. Although this may entail boundary shifts and much larger supervisory unions than we are used to, we would keep a seat at the table. We would continue to have a meaningful voice in decisions made. We would keep our say. 
Some advocacy groups argue that supervisory unions open the door to privatization. That’s a distraction. The real threat is centralized power in sprawling districts, where communities lose influence. Supervisory unions allow for shared efficiencies, collaboration and cost-effective shared services, without silencing community voices. That’s the balance Vermont needs. 
Act 73 established a redistricting committee that has been appointed and is already beginning their work, with up to three proposals due in December and a vote by the Legislature to approve one in January. 
We must act now to influence the outcome. We are not powerless, and there are knowledgeable members on this committee who understand rural concerns. Talk to your school board. Call your legislators. Let them know that we want to stay in a supervisory union. We value local decision making.
Much of Vermont is rural. Our education system should reflect that and be accessible for rural families. 
Without community-based schooling, transportation challenges and long bus rides may force young families like mine to leave Vermont’s small towns at a faster rate than they already are, further accelerating small-town economic decline. 
Consolidation of school governance means disappearing civic engagement and a diminished ability to influence important decisions about education in the future — that’s what we risk if we let our school boards go.
This is a fight for more than education. It’s a fight for our communities. It’s a fight for democracy. It’s a fight for rural Vermont.

(Mugshot from the Indiana Department of Correction)Attorneys for death row inmate Roy Lee Ward and the Indiana Attorney General’s Office are sparring before the state’s highest court over whether Ward’s tentative execution date should stand.
Ward’s defense team, in a July 30 filing, urged the Indiana Supreme Court to “recall” the tentative Oct. 10 date based on “new evidence,” which includes sworn affidavits of witnesses to Benjamin Ritchie’s execution in May, as well as postmortem toxicology reports from both Ritchie and another executed inmate, Joseph Corcoran.
But the state argued Monday that Ward has no valid legal grounds to delay his execution, and that his latest claims are “irrelevant” and belong in a different court.
Ward raped and murdered 15‑year‑old Stacy Payne in her Spencer County home in 2001.
Witnesses at Ritchie’s execution described seeing the inmate “violently” lifting “his head and shoulders off the gurney after the execution drug, pentobarbital, was administered,” according to court filings. 
The defense team filed five witness affidavits: one from Ritchie’s spiritual advisor, who was present in the execution chamber; another from Ritchie’s friend, who viewed the execution from the condemned’s witness room; and three from Indiana public defender staff — two of Ritchie’s attorneys and a mitigation specialist.
Story continues below.
Ward filings
 
“Mr. Ritchie violently lifted his head and shoulders off the gurney after the execution drug was administered. That should not happen when non-expired and uncontaminated pentobarbital is properly administered,” defense attorneys wrote. “Witnesses described the movement as ‘violent,’ ‘abrupt,’ and ‘unnatural’ — inconsistent with a properly carried out execution using a barbiturate.”
The defense argued the movement indicated possible contamination, degradation or improper administration of the drug.
“Such movements indicate that Mr. Ritchie may have experienced pain and distress due to either the use of expired or contaminated drugs or the failure to properly administer the execution drug,” Ward’s attorneys wrote.
The Attorney General’s Office countered in a Monday afternoon filing that Ward has not given the court a “legally cognizable reason to deny the State’s motion” for the execution to go ahead as planned and that “all of his complaints are irrelevant to this Court’s legal duty to set an execution date.”
“Ultimately,” state attorneys continued, “Ward’s assemblage of various complaints about a different inmate’s execution, public-record requests, and government-procurement transparency have nothing to do with whether this Court should follow the law and set his execution date.”
Ward argues for a delay
Ward’s attorneys additionally accused the state of withholding critical information about the Indiana Department of Correction’s lethal injection drugs, specifically “whether they are expired, how they are transported and stored, or their potency and sterility.” 
Despite public records requests — several of which are not processed — the defense team said there has been “no disclosure regarding the amount of the drug” in DOC’s possession” and called the lack of transparency “shocking and unfair.”
Ward’s filing also pointed to Senate Enrolled Act 5, an Indiana transparency law effective July 1 that requires certain state contracts to be posted online. 
Ward’s team contends that DOC “must post a bid for proposals to obtain the drugs necessary for Mr. Ward’s execution” and take “the thirty days to solicit proposals from contractors to ensure transparency and cost effectiveness.”
Story continues below.
Witness Statements
 
Gov. Mike Braun said recently that Indiana does not currently have usable lethal injection drugs, and that state lawmakers should debate the future of capital punishment in Indiana in the 2026 session.
Braun said, too, that he doesn’t “intend to put another [dose] on the shelf” and risk expiration, although his office clarified that additional execution drugs would be ordered when required by the state supreme court.
In June, the governor disclosed that state officials spent $1.175 million on lethal injection doses over the past year — $600,000 of which was spent on drugs that expired before use. The cost has been between $275,000 and $300,000 per dose.
Ward’s attorneys asked the court to “deny the request to set an execution date, grant Ward’s request to file a Successive Post-Conviction Petition and remand for evidentiary proceedings in the post-conviction court.”
State makes case to proceed
In a separate filing, the Indiana Attorney General’s Office argued that Ward’s proposed claims are “meritless” and filed in the wrong forum. They held that post-conviction rules only allow challenges to the validity of a conviction or sentence, not on grounds involving civil-rights or the method of execution. 
Even if such claims were permitted, the office argued, the remedies Ward seeks — like forcing public-records disclosures, halting his execution until he’s satisfied with execution drug testing, or altering the execution chamber — are not authorized under the rules for post-conviction proceedings and instead belong in a separate civil-rights lawsuit.
Story continues below.
State Responses
 
“Whether any of these claims have merit” is irrelevant, state attorneys wrote, because “none of them are legal reasons why this Court should not follow the mandates” of state law and set an execution date.
As such, the state said Ward’s witness affidavits and toxicology-related evidence are outside the scope of current proceedings.
And in response to Ward’s transparency claims, the state argued SEA 5 does not apply to lethal-injection procurement because “the identity of a supplier of lethal-injection drugs and any ‘information reasonably calculated’ to identify the supplier is confidential by law” under Indiana Code.
The state also criticized Ward’s public-records complaints, saying his “personal surprise or sense of indignation is simply not a legal argument.” The attorney general’s team doubled down that public-records disputes have “nothing at all to do with whether this Court should set an execution date.”

The state noted, too, that Ward still has judicial remedies under Indiana’s public-records law that he has not used, such as challenging records request denials or delays. 
The attorney general’s office further rejected Ward’s complaints about limited audio and visual access for witnesses to his execution. They argued that neither the lack of sound between the execution chamber and witness room nor the viewing glass arrangement violates constitutional protections.
It’s now up to the Indiana Supreme Court to decide whether Ward’s execution date will be finalized or delayed for further litigation.
Justices previously indicated that an execution date remains pending until the court issues a definitive ruling.
Ward’s case has spanned more than two decades. His initial conviction and death sentence were overturned due to concerns about pretrial publicity, but a second jury sentenced him to death again in 2007 after he pleaded guilty. His appeals concluded in 2017.
Court records indicate Ward attacked Payne after she answered the door of her Dale, Indiana, home shortly after noon on July 11, 2001. Her younger sister heard screams and called 911. Police arrived within minutes and found Ward standing in the doorway of the home, holding a knife. He was arrested at the scene. 
Payne, an honor roll student, later died from severe injuries.

Its board members include Gov. Tim Walz, State Auditor Julie Blaha, Secretary of State Steve Simon, and Attorney General Keith Ellison.
The State Board of Investment pledges to “consider all material risks and opportunities” including those from climate change and the energy transition, according to Minnesota’s Climate Roadmap.
That’s why the board should take a close look at the implications of its investments in Energy Capital Partners, which is currently seeking an additional $250 million investment from the state.
This is concerning because while Energy Capital Partners claims to have a focus on “sustainability infrastructure providing reliable, affordable, and clean energy,” it is in the process of purchasing the General James M. Gavin coal-fired power plant. Gavin is a 50-year-old coal plant in southeastern Ohio and is one of the most deadly power plants in the nation in terms of health effects due to air pollution with a history of public health and environmental violations.
The Gavin power plant represents risks to its owners due to ongoing litigation regarding expensive toxic coal ash cleanup requirements, the plant’s high debt burden, and the unstable future for coal, not to mention the reputational risks associated with owning a power plant that has been associated with over 200 premature deaths per year and $1.7 billion in costs associated with health problems from the plant’s pollution.
The Gavin coal plant is the single biggest contributor to Energy Capital Partners’ health impacts. According to research released this summer, emissions from Energy Capital Partner’s assets nationally are estimated to cause between $1.8 and $3.3 billion in costs related to health impacts each year. The emissions are estimated to cause 62,000 asthma incidents, 130 emergency room visits, 11,000 lost work days, $15,000 lost school days, and over 200 premature deaths.
Minnesota should not rely on returns from an out-of-state power plant that causes the premature deaths of hundreds of people each year to fund the retirement of state employees.
The Minnesota State Board of Investment has an opportunity to collaborate with Energy Capital Partners to insist on a thoughtful retirement plan for the Gavin coal plant. This would be a positive result for the environment, public health, and Minnesota public pensioners.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-1167751510.jpg,,,2025-08-12 07:56:23.403715

(Photo by Getty Images)NEW YORK — After a year in the U.S. Navy, Loceny Kamara said he was discharged in 2023, because while on base he had developed mental health issues, including severe anxiety and nightmares, and had fallen into alcoholism.
Kamara, 23, went to rehab and managed to get sober for some time while living with family in the Bronx, he said. But after he lost his job as a security guard in December, Kamara was kicked out of his home. Now he lives at a veterans homeless shelter in Long Island City, New York, and he relies on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as food stamps, and odd jobs to make ends meet.
Each month, nearly 42 million people receive SNAP benefits to help supplement their grocery budgets. Able-bodied SNAP recipients who are between 18 and 54 and don’t have children have always been required to work. Veterans, however, have been exempt from those rules — but that’s about to change.
The giant domestic policy measure that President Donald Trump signed on July 4 eliminates that exemption. Beginning in 2026, veterans will have to prove they are working, volunteering, participating in job training, or looking for work for at least 80 hours a month to keep their food stamps beyond three months, unless they qualify for another exemption, such as having certain disabilities.

Republicans in Congress and conservatives who helped formulate the law say these eligibility changes are necessary to stop people who could be working from abusing the system. But critics say the change fails to take into account the barriers many veterans face, and that the new work rules will cause thousands of veterans to go hungry.
“I’m pissed. I mean, I cannot get a job. Nowhere to live,” said Kamara. As he spoke, Kamara pointed to his collared shirt, noting that he had just dressed up to interview for a job as a security guard. He learned that morning he hadn’t gotten the job.
“I’ve been out of work for eight months,” Kamara told Stateline. “It’s hard to get a job right now for everybody.”
 Veterans depend on SNAP

Nationally, around 1.2 million veterans with lower incomes, or about 8% of the total veteran population of 16.2 million, rely on food stamps for themselves and their families, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning research group.
An analysis by the group found veterans tend to have lower rates of employment because they are more likely to have health conditions, such as traumatic brain injuries, that make it difficult for them to work. They also tend to have less formal education, though many have specialized skills from their time in the military.
There has been a work requirement for most SNAP recipients since 1996. But Robert Rector, a senior research fellow at The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, said the rules have “never really been enforced.” Rector argued that able-bodied people who have been exempt from the work requirement, such as veterans and homeless people, create an unnecessary burden on the system if they are capable of working but don’t.
“Most of the people that are in this category live in households with other people that have incomes, and so there really isn’t a chronic food shortage here,” Rector said in an interview. “We have tens of thousands of free food banks that people can go to. So it’s just a requirement to nudge these people in the proper direction, and it should no longer go unenforced.”

Darryl Chavis, 62, said that view ignores the difficulties that many veterans face. When Chavis left the U.S. Army at 21 after two years of service, he said, he was “severely depressed.”
“Nobody even came to help me,” said Chavis, who served as a watercraft operator, responsible for operating and maintaining tugboats, barges and other landing craft.
Chavis said he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, which has made it difficult for him to keep a job. He just moved back to New York from Virginia after leaving a relationship. He’s been at the housing shelter in Long Island City since January.
“What I’m trying to do is get settled in to, you know, stabilize into an apartment. I have the credentials to get a job. So it’s not like I’m not gonna look for a job. I have to work. I’m in transition, and the obstacles don’t make it easy,” Chavis said.
The new SNAP work rules apply to all able-bodied adults between 55 and 64 who don’t have dependents, and parents with children above the age of 14. Some groups, such as asylum-seekers and refugees, are no longer eligible for the program.
Barbara Guinn, commissioner of the New York State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, estimates that around 300,000 New Yorkers could lose SNAP benefits due to work requirements. Of those, around 22,000 are veterans, homeless or aging out of foster care, she said. Almost 3 million New Yorkers relied on SNAP as of March 2025.
Veterans in other states are in a similar situation. In California, an estimated 115,000 veterans receive SNAP benefits, according to a study by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The number is nearly 100,000 in Florida and Texas, and 49,000 in Georgia.
Between 2015 and 2019 about 11% of veterans between the ages of 18 and 64 lived in food insecure households, meaning they had limited or uncertain access to food, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees SNAP.
“We know that SNAP is the best way to help address hunger. It gets benefits directly to individuals,” Guinn said. “There are other ways that people can get assistance if they need it, through food banks or other charitable organizations, but we do not think that those organizations will have the capacity to pick up the needs.”
 A greater burden on states

In addition to the work rule changes, the new law reduces federal funding for SNAP by about $186 billion through 2034 — a cut of roughly 20%, according to the Congressional Budget Office, an independent research arm of Congress. The federal government expects the new work requirements to reduce SNAP spending by $69 billion as people who don’t comply are dropped from the rolls.
SNAP has historically been funded by the federal government, with states picking up part of the cost of administering the program. Under the new law, states will have to cover between 5% and 15% of SNAP costs starting in fiscal year 2028, depending on how accurately they distribute benefits to people who are eligible for the program.










This has been a strategic agenda to dismantle SNAP and to blame states for doing so.


– Gina Plata-Nino, SNAP deputy director at the Food Research & Action Center


“This has been a strategic agenda to dismantle SNAP and to blame states for doing so, because they knew they are making it so incredibly burdensome to run and operate and unaffordable,” said Gina Plata-Nino, SNAP deputy director at the Food Research & Action Center, a poverty and hunger advocacy group.
“States are going to have to cut something, because there’s no surplus. There are no unlimited resources that states may have in order to be able to offset the harm.”
Guinn said New York expects to see a new cost burden of at least $1.4 billion each year. In California, new state costs could total as much as $3.7 billion annually, according to the California Department of Social Services.
Kaitlynne Yancy, director of membership programs at Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, said many veterans with disabilities will not be able to fulfill the work requirements or find resources elsewhere. And it’s unclear whether states will be able to provide their own relief to people who are no longer exempted from work requirements or will be excluded from the program.
“It is a frustrating thing to see, especially for those that have been willing to put everything on the line and sacrifice everything for this country if their country called them to do so,” she said.
Yancy, 35, served in the U.S. Navy from 2010 to 2014. She began to use food stamps and the Medicaid program, the public health insurance program for people with lower incomes, as she navigated life’s challenges. They included going back to school to pursue her bachelor’s degree, becoming a single mother, and a leukemia diagnosis for one of her children. Frequent trips to the hospital made it hard for her to work steadily or attend school for 20 hours each week, she said.
Guinn said the new rules will create significant administrative challenges, too; even SNAP recipients who are working will struggle to prove it.
“Maybe they’re working one month, they have a job, and then their employer cuts their hours the next month,” Guinn told Stateline. “There are mechanisms for people to upload documentation as needed to demonstrate compliance with the program, but from an administrative standpoint, right now, we don’t have any super-high-tech automated way of doing this.”

Previously, such officials may have opened their accounts on a four-year cycle timed with their campaigns, meaning they only filed reports once every four years. Now, any elected official making at least $5,000 annually, which includes county council members and many township trustees, will be subject to the new requirements. 
 
For more information from the Indiana Secretary of State’s Office, visit here.


Many of these local offices might be reckoning with such annual reporting requirements for the first time, said David Bottorff, the executive director of the Association of Indiana Counties. Prior to the law, such officials may have only dealt with such reports during a campaign year.
“(As a candidate,) I may or may not accept contributions from outside (entities) or seek contributions. For some of the county offices, especially county assessor or treasurer … they may be self-funded,” he said.
Because of that, Bottorff said, a newly elected official may then close their campaign account while in office, opting to open a new account if they run for reelection. 
“Going forward, you’ll just have to report that,” he said. “If you’re not doing anything, they would just report zeros.” 
However, Bottorff said there might be a gray area for an incumbent politician going to a political party dinner or buying tickets for a local fish fry with their own money.
“Some people might think, ‘Well, that’s not campaigning,’ but, if you’re there as an elected official, arguably, you’re there as a candidate as well,” Bottorff said. 
The change stems from a definition shift under House Enrolled Act 1679, a wide-ranging elections omnibus bill. Over hours of committee testimony, neither the bill authors nor its supporters speculated about the impact on local offices, saying only that the word “candidate” was used in different ways throughout Indiana code. Having one definition would simplify election and campaign finance law throughout Indiana statute. 
Candidates for local offices file their campaign finance statements and reports to the appropriate county offices, potentially adding to the work of those elected officials. A local elected official will also need to keep their campaign account open if they make more than $500 in contributions or expenditures, regardless of whether they earn less than $5,000 or not.

(Photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner) For more than two decades, Percy Brown has worked as an educator, his core priority striving to address gaps in achievement between Black and white students.
There’s no single cause for those gaps, Brown says. Poor teaching methods are one factor, in his view. He points to changes in how reading is taught, for example, that have been shown to improve reading proficiency among white and Black students alike.
But, he contends, that’s only part of the answer. A legacy of discrimination through the generations demands more careful attention to making sure every student is fully welcome at the schoolhouse door and gets the opportunity to learn and thrive, he says, in the classroom and out.
Brown pursued that goal as the director of equity and student achievement in the Middleton School District, west of Madison, and more recently as a trainer and consultant on diversity and equity in education as well as a speaker on other education-related topics.
Biases about Black students’ inherent academic abilities persist, Brown contends — influencing not only white teachers but Black students as well.
“We’ve dealt with racial inferiority being placed on us and embedded in the psyche of all of America for a very, very long time,” Brown says. “And while we might have egalitarian beliefs, those stereotypes and biases are still there.”
Concern about that legacy drove Brown to write “Strength Through Generations” — a combination memoir, thumbnail sketch of Black history and call to action.
The book has more than one audience, Brown says. 
One audience is fellow educators — “to reach teachers, to help them be more culturally responsive in the classroom,” Brown says.
“I also wrote it for high school students that are African-American, so that they can learn more about their history, with the hope that that inspires them,” he says. “To know thyself is so key to what you’ll be able to do in life.”
DEI under attack
The book comes at a time when organized programs to address racial diversity, promote equity to overcome centuries of discrimination and subjugation, and promote inclusion of the broad range of people into national life and institutions are under fierce attack.
Starting on his first day in office President Donald Trump has issued a series of executive orders aimed at ending diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs in federal government and education while also condemning inclusive policies in the private sector.
Brown has critiqued some of the ways DEI has been carried out. When he read an audit of Universities of Wisconsin DEI programs conducted by the Legislative Audit Bureau on behalf of the Legislature, he was struck that there seemed to be no consistent definition throughout the system for DEI.
But he also considers the anti-DEI wave a backlash to the protests in 2020 after the police killing of George Floyd. “That woke up the world,” Brown says. “There was a coming together, and it wasn’t even politicized like that.”
Right-wing influencers began attacking critical race theory — a complex, academic concept — and subsequently DEI, he observes, deploying “the anti-woke rhetoric to really scare people.”
Six years earlier, however, in Middleton, “I was able to collaborate and get support from people on the right side of the aisle to try to make things better for historically disenfranchised students,” Brown says. “It wasn’t a boogie man.”
The book’s publication is especially timely, he believes.
“There’s a lot going on that I would say is just anti-‘We the people’ — unless you’re talking about ‘We the People’ in its original intent for this nation to be a nation for white people — and then nobody else,” Brown says.
Family history and Black history
Brown’s book weaves the stories of his grandfather’s involvement in the civil rights struggles in rural, segregated Mississippi and the lives of his father, aunts and uncles growing up there together with a primer on Black history.
“As a Black male educator with a background in social studies, I know that America’s schools focus heavily on teaching slavery, but this does not address the more significant curricular issue when it comes to the history of Black people,” Brown writes in the book’s introduction. “There’s no mention of ancient African civilizations, such as the Kingdoms of Mali, Songhai, Benin, Kemet, Nubia, Axum and Ethiopia.”
By teaching “a more comprehensive history of Black people,” he writes, educators can appropriately build self-esteem of Black children and also “change the perception of those who are not Black.”
Brown’s father, Percy Sr., and his father’s siblings integrated their local high school in Mississippi in 1965 after the district was forced to admit Black students. Ku Klux Klan members burned a cross at their home and fired gunshots. “The intimidation was real, as real as could be,” Percy Sr. told his son in an interview included in the book.
Finding common ground
His father moved north from Mississippi to attend the University of Wisconsin-Madison, graduating in 1975. Percy Brown Jr. grew up in Madison, and his book reflects on the racial divisions then and now in the state’s capital city despite its progressive image.
When it came time to go to college, Brown attended Delta State University in Mississippi near where his father grew up.
A bout of spring cleaning helped trigger Brown’s idea to write the book. He turned up a paper he had written as an undergraduate in 1997 “about the need to incorporate Black history into the curriculum to help build the self-esteem of Black children,” he recalls. The paper concluded with his declaration that one day he would write a book about Black history to help meet that need.
Not long after finding the paper, he traveled to Egypt in 2023 to learn about the African roots of one of the world’s oldest civilizations — roots that Brown says have long been unappreciated.
“Going to Egypt — that was transformational for me, and in a lot of ways I think I felt more closely connected to the human family,” Brown says.
The final push for the book came from the CEO at a publishing firm that specializes in producing books by entrepreneurs.
While his book focuses on Black experience, Brown says that in his consulting work he sees parallel experiences in places where the population is all white or nearly so.
Conducting a student assembly (about being safe online) in Door County, he got a firsthand look at the way schools there are also under-resourced. “My empathy for them up there is no different than the empathy that I have for the Black kids here in the community,” Brown says.
He worries about polarization and what he calls the tribalism that divides the public.
“The things that we have in common, that’s how you start to build those authentic relationships,” Brown says. “That’s how you start to build community, right? And it’s about our collective shared stories — not shutting down one story.”

That was his core message to a diverse crowd that gathered Monday evening for a town hall on the outskirts of downtown Lansing.
The event at The Avenue, amid the whirring cacophony of pinball machines and arcade games, was just one of several stops in El Sayed’s early travels around the state as he seeks to garner support in next year’s Democratic U.S. Senate primary.
The contest will see him square off against U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens of Birmingham, state Sen. Mallory McMorrow of Royal Oak, and research health specialist Rachel Howard. The winner will face Republican Mike Rogers of White Lake, the only GOP candidate on the other side of the race.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The contest remains in its earliest phases, and competition will likely grow fierce as the months wind down to 2026, but El Sayed is working to carve out a path for himself by taking on issues near and dear to progressive voters. 
In an interview with Michigan Advance, El Sayed, who previously ran for governor in 2018, said he hopes to build a campaign that isn’t about him or his own story, but about the people of Michigan and their struggles to simply exist in dire and newly uncertain times.
“That’s how movements grow. That’s how you build,” El Sayed said.

On Monday, the candidate’s crowd work and his campaign’s commitment to meeting people where they are were on full display. 
He also detailed his understanding of issues progressive voters want mentioned in the race – solutions to housing for marginalized people, fighting the scourge of corporate money in politics, taxing the wealthy to support more robust social safety nets and putting an end to what many, including Amnesty International, have called a genocide of the Palestinian people resulting from war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.
El Sayed’s commentary and potential solutions to those problems are why he has an early supporter in Democratic state Rep. Emily Dievendorf of Lansing, who introduced El Sayed on Monday evening.
The representative had just attended a Lansing City Council meeting where they advocated for Lansing’s unhoused residents, and the moment was fresh in their mind.
“We should be advocating for the hardest hit among our neighbors. We should be fighting for the most vulnerable,” Dievendorf said. “When one person experiences instability, we all experience more instability.”

After some introduction and notes on why he believed his voice was needed in the U.S. Senate, El Sayed took questions from ardent supporters and first-time rally goers.
Fitting with the theme introduced by Dievendorf, one attendee mentioned the work to create and raise funds for an LGBTQ+ affirming homeless shelter in Lansing. They said it was difficult for unhoused transgender and queer people in the city to use traditional and typically religious options because those facilities might not accept them.
El Sayed was then asked about housing solutions for marginalized people.
As an Egyptian American, El Sayed said the question gets at the heart of engrained discrimination and its consequences.
“You should be able to have access to the basic means of a dignified life,” El Sayed said. “Too often, you get folks who come and say, ‘I want to stand with you and your community,’ but when it comes to the substance of standing with you, all of a sudden, they’re gone, nowhere to be found.”
El Sayed said marginalized people need meaningful support, and that means showing up when it matters and not when it’s easy. That includes state legislators, members of Congress and the U.S. Senate.
If elected, El Sayed said he would champion “real legislation” protecting LGBTQ+ people and those from all walks of life from discrimination in housing and health care.
He also warned about the intersection of homelessness and big technology, saying the country is facing a crisis where large capital is flexing its muscle in the real estate sector.
“Nobody’s ever thought of homelessness or housing as tech problems, but Airbnb and Vrbo are tech companies,” El Sayed said. “What they’ve enabled people with a little bit of excess capital to do is to buy up local real estate and then rent it on the market in ways that increase the price, and prices out local people all over the country.”
One way to prevent that, he said, was to engage more local developers who have a stake in their communities to build affordable housing that caters to those communities.
El Sayed asked supporters to take three actions before leaving that evening, but one stood out among the usual campaign requests. El Sayed asked attendees to reach out to people from whom they’ve become estranged in the wake of several elections that have divided families and friends.

The candidate told the crowd that it was necessary to rebuild those bonds if the progressive movement he’s championing was going to have any real chance at succeeding.
In his interview with the Advance, the candidate said one attendee told him that they were not quite ready to make those amends with members of their family who voted for Trump. 
El Sayed was moved by that person’s difficulty, and understood where they were coming from, but he remained unwavering in his belief that those ties could be mended. After all, restoring common ground between divided loved ones and friends was, at its core, a revolutionary and progressive act, he said.
“I’ve taken my fair share of hate. I know what that looks like, and I know how painful that is,” El Sayed said. “I just don’t know that we as a society can succeed if we’re not willing to meet hate with love, or fear with empathy. … Politics, at the end of the day, is about the emotional struggle around who we are and who we want to be.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/P8114712-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-12 06:57:40.395609

Facing a $1.8 million shortfall, city decides to make up for loss by cutting back on fertilizing, irrigating and otherwise maintaining public parks and landscaping.
The post Wyoming property tax relief prompts Casper to reduce maintenance of city parks appeared first on WyoFile .","CASPER—Several parks and other green spaces in Casper will see decreased mowing and associated maintenance this summer as a result of the property tax relief passed by the Wyoming Legislature earlier this year.
The city currently maintains 44 formal parks spanning about 120 acres, plus nearly 100 other landscaped areas, including street corners, street islands, lawns at city-owned buildings and more.
In years past, the city would mow and otherwise maintain those spaces on a weekly basis. However, after the 25% property tax exemption that followed additional cuts the prior year, maintenance at several locations will be cut back to every other week or eliminated.
“Combined with the 2024 cuts they passed last year, that includes the 50% property tax cut for long-term senior residents, this has resulted in a $1.8 million projected shortfall in the general fund that had to be reconciled for [the coming fiscal year],” Parks, Recreation and Public Services Director Zulima Lopez said. “While a $1.8 million shortfall is less than 1% of the total city budget, it represents more than 3% of the $56 million general fund, which is the fund that pays for daily operations like police, fire, streets and parks.”
Lopez said the city parks division is expected to save roughly $144,800 by cutting back park irrigation and fertilizing, as well as reducing various seasonal labor costs. Five seasonal employees were eliminated from the park maintenance operations budget in the proposed fiscal year 2026 budget.
Several factors were considered when deciding which areas would have reduced maintenance, including park popularity, any recent investments, whether there were shelters or other facilities on the site, burden on city staff and more. Lopez pointed to the grassy islands along CY Avenue as an example of a spot where the burden on workers was taken into account.
“CY Islands are difficult, even dangerous, for staff to access,” she said.

Among the locations to see reduced maintenance, the Casper Parks Division will reduce work at all city buildings except for Casper City Hall, where Lopez said landscaping was freshly installed in late 2024.
Park maintenance entails far more than just mowing, Lopez added. Crews also maintain park irrigation systems, fertilize, spray for weeds and perform upkeep on playground equipment. Parks to see reduced maintenance will see reductions in all work.
At a May work session of the Casper City Council, Lopez told councilors that she believes the reduction will have a noticeable and detrimental impact on the aesthetic appeal of the affected parks. She also said the reduced maintenance will likely have a negative effect on many city park rehabilitation projects.
“The longer we sustain reduced maintenance, the higher the cost to restore the turf areas will be,” Lopez said.
At the time, Councilor Amber Pollock suggested possibly cutting back on holiday lighting to leave more funding for maintenance.
“I would be in favor of eliminating [holiday lighting] entirely in favor of moving that funding to help us with turf, because that doesn’t have a potential cost impact to us later,” she said.

It's telling, columnist Kerry Drake writes, that the fired journalists at the eight shuttered newspapers immediately focused on the impact the closures would have on their readers and communities.
The post Wyoming’s newspaper closures threaten government accountability appeared first on WyoFile .","Losing a job in journalism can be soul-crushing. I know because I’ve lost a couple.

Opinion

When I read that eight local newspapers in Wyoming closed without warning last Wednesday, my thoughts immediately turned to the well-being of reporters and editors who saw their world spin out of control through no fault of their own.
It’s telling that when other journalists sought their reaction, these professionals suddenly experiencing the loss of paychecks and health insurance focused on how their layoffs will impact their readers and communities.
Evanston, Guernsey, Kemmerer, Lusk, Lyman, Pinedale, Torrington and Wheatland experienced a dramatic decrease in local news when the Illinois-based News Media Corporation — now there’s a generic name! — shut down its papers here and in four other states. Some journalists learned of their fate right before they were to print their weekly edition, so presses didn’t roll.
Cali O’Hare was managing editor of the Pinedale Roundup, which started publishing 120 years ago. “We’re going to see what we can do to fill the gap here in Sublette County to ensure that our community still has access to factual, reliable news, because we just can’t stomach the idea of just being OK with the news desert here,” she told the Wyoming Tribune Eagle.
There may be help coming that could allow some of the newspapers to reopen, but nothing was certain as of Sunday. O’Hare said a potential Roundup buyer has been found, and another group is reportedly interested in reopening the Platte County Record-Times, Torrington Telegram and Lusk Herald. But News Media Corporation has, according to sources involved in the situation, yet to respond to any offers.
“Most of us are concerned about the community,” Marie Hamilton, a reporter for the Record-Times and the Guernsey Gazette, told Cowboy State Daily. “These are our people. This is our home. It’s an honor of a lifetime to work in a rural community.”
What will readers do without their local paper? “Without us being the watchdog on a couple of boards here, what’s going to happen?” Hamilton replied. “How many more secret meetings are going to happen because the papers are down?”
More than one-third of the nation’s local newspapers have closed since 2005, typically shrinking newsrooms to a few employees and cutting costs to the bone before finally shutting the doors.


There is a whole body of research aimed at finding out how the issue is affecting residents and institutions like local governments. I like how comedian John Oliver once framed the issue on his “Last Week Tonight” TV show: “Not having reporters at government meetings is like a teacher leaving her room of 7th-graders to supervise themselves.”
“When police brutality spikes, when welfare offices deny claims, when local officials divert funds — these are the moments when communities need their journalists the most,” writes Abby Youran Qin in the Milwaukee Independent.
Without journalistic scrutiny, Qin adds, “scholars find that mismanagement flourishes, corruption costs balloon, and the communities most vulnerable to abuse receive the least accountability. This is how news deserts exacerbate inequality.”
Newspapers are critical for informing the public about political candidates and their beliefs.. Without that information, voters may stay home on election day — or go to the polls unprepared.
Newspapers are also essential for keeping residents informed about the policies mulled by their local governments. Without them, people may not know about a controversy until it’s already been decided. Without a paper’s opinion section, there are no letters to the editor, commentaries or forums, and the public becomes less empowered and less able to influence public policy.
Way back in 2011, the Federal Communications Commission had a bleak forecast in the wake of then-unprecedented newspaper closures: “More government waste, more local corruption, less effective schools, and other serious community problems.” It’s all happened.
Researchers at the University of Notre Dame and the University of Illinois at Chicago examined the impact of local newspaper closures on public finance. “Local newspapers hold their governments accountable, keeping municipal borrowing costs low and ultimately saving local taxpayers money,” the study found.
Here’s a non-economic cost: Who will continue the legacy of reporting the history of towns like Lusk, where the Herald has been published since 1886, four years before Wyoming Territory was granted statehood?
It’s a job done by fewer people since small local newsrooms began cutting employees to keep afloat. The Pinedale Roundup absorbed the Sublette Examiner, then O’Hare became the only employee when the owner laid off two reporters.
In a Wyoming Public Radio broadcast last October, Melodie Edwards profiled O’Hare and her difficulties covering a story that made international headlines. A man brought a muzzled, injured wolf he’d run over with a snowmobile and paraded it through a Sublette County bar before killing it.
While out-of-state reporters were parachuting in to capture the local flavor and quickly departing, O’Hare’s job was infinitely harder. Other journalists didn’t have to deal with county officials, who are also her neighbors, pressuring her to stop reporting the story, which she related to Edwards.
O’Hare’s reporting helped shape local and state opinion, including legislative discussions that culminated in a new offense for torturing, tormenting, mutilating or causing undue suffering to wildlife — including predatory animals and birds — that have been taken into possession.
Edwards ended her story with this observation: “While lots of other papers publish more and more press releases and national stories, [O’Hare] planned to keep writing original, locally-focused stories. That means the Pinedale Roundup won’t become a ghost paper anytime soon.”
But that’s precisely what happened less than a year later in eight Wyoming towns.
Local governments will be far less accountable. Fewer people will vote, and the newspapers that gave the public a voice have been silenced. Corporate journalism is beholden to out-of-state owners like News Media Corporation, not people who worked for them — and certainly not the public.
These are tense times for all American newspapers trying to hold on, particularly small operations in rural areas. I hope new offers will be accepted by the Illinois owner and presses can roll again. But until that happens, the best contribution Wyomingites can make is supporting local papers across the state any way they can.

(Jarvis DeBerry/Louisiana Illuminator)A review of how Louisiana keeps its Medicaid rolls up to date found the state paid out benefits for more than 1,000 people over the past six years after they died. Nearly $10 million was paid to managed care organizations over that period, even though no health care services were actually provided.
The Louisiana Legislative Auditor conducted its study as part of Gov. Jeff Landry’s Fiscal Responsibility Program, which he has branded LA DOGE. It looked specifically at how state health officials keep track of when Medicaid beneficiaries die and whether outside data sources could help that process. 
When auditors used those additional sources, they found 1,072 beneficiaries who died between February 2019 and March 2025 and approximately $9.6 million spent collectively on their Medicaid coverage. Auditors said the actual spending figure is higher because their calculations only included dental coverage payments – and not health coverage – for the final eight months reviewed.

According to the audit report, the Louisiana Department of Health relies on federal and state data sources to identify dead Medicaid beneficiaries. They include Louisiana Vital Records, the Social Security Administration, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the state Department of Children and Family Services and the managed care organizations the state pays to deliver Medicaid offerings.
For its analysis, the Louisiana Legislative Auditor’s staff also used obituaries and identified 511 dead Medicaid beneficiaries the state missed in its reviews. Payouts to managed care organizations for this group totaled $5.22 million over the six-year period, and the median time between the beneficiary’s death and the most recent monthly payout to their managed care provider was more than 20 months.
Auditors found 168 more deceased Medicaid beneficiaries through the Social Security Administration’s Death Master File, a source the state health department has not used. The median time between the beneficiary’s death and the latest payment in this group was almost 800 days, according to the audit.   
The Legislative Auditor recommended the Louisiana Department of Health determine whether it should use third-party data sources as part of its eligibility determination process to identify deceased Medicaid beneficiaries. Out of the $9.6 million Louisiana paid for Medicaid services never provided, the audit identified $7.6 million through third-party sources.    
In his July 30 response to the Legislative Auditor, state Health Secretary Doug Greenstein agreed with the audit’s recommendation and said his department was “in the process of working with the U.S. Department of Treasury to gain the necessary approvals to receive the Social Security Administration Death Master File.” 
The health department was presented with the auditor’s findings in May. In June, approximately $4 million in state payments to Medicaid managed care organizations were to be withheld to recoup part of the money paid on behalf of dead beneficiaries, the audit report said.

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — A University of Nebraska regent faces a felony charge for allegedly driving while under the influence of alcohol and crashing into another vehicle in mid-May, breaking the back and pelvis of a passenger in the other car.
NU Regent Elizabeth O’Connor of Omaha, 34, a former Douglas County deputy county attorney serving in her seventh year as a regent, is accused of a DUI causing serious bodily injury from the night of May 21 in Omaha’s Benson neighborhood, which is in O’Connor’s district. The Class IIIA felony charge carries a maximum of three years in prison and 18 months post-release supervision.
The severity of the allegation could impact whether O’Connor can serve. The Nebraska Constitution bars felons from holding public office unless the person’s civil rights are restored by the Nebraska Board of Pardons, which consists of the governor, secretary of state and attorney general.
Neither O’Connor nor her attorney has yet addressed her future as a regent, a position to which she was reelected to a 6-year term in November.
Alleged May 21 incident
According to police reports, O’Connor was driving her Subaru Outback east on Blondo Street about 8:33 p.m., when she crossed into the westbound lane and collided with a Ford Focus at the intersection of N 63rd and Blondo Streets. 
Police said they found a half-empty bottle of Fireball Whisky in O’Connor’s vehicle and wrote that she was showing symptoms of intoxication, including bloodshot or watery eyes, slurred speech and alcohol on her breath.

Field sobriety tests confirmed her condition, the investigator wrote, and a blood test collected immediately after the crash indicated O’Connor had a blood alcohol concentration of four times the legal limit: 0.321%.
Both vehicles were totaled, according to the accident report. The crash occurred minutes of O’Connor’s home. 
The vehicle police say her car hit had five passengers in it, including three children. The driver and children sustained minor injuries, according to the police report. The woman seriously injured in the crash and O’Connor, who had minor injuries, were taken to the Nebraska Medical Center.
O’Connor declined to comment for this story, and her attorney could not be reached. The family involved in the crash also declined to comment when reached by the Nebraska Examiner. Two listed witnesses did not return calls seeking comment. A spokesperson for the University of Nebraska system said NU “does not comment on ongoing legal matters.”
Douglas County Attorney’s Office
It took two months to file charges, partly because of O’Connor’s employment as a civil attorney in the Douglas County Attorney’s Office until last Tuesday, when she resigned, the timing of which the County Attorney’s Office confirmed.
Omaha’s top prosecutors opted out of the case involving O’Connor, citing a potential conflict of interest. That left Omaha City Prosecutor Kevin Slimp to file the felony charge in Douglas County Court on July 30. 
Slimp told the Examiner a key reason for the delay was waiting for the blood test to come back from the lab. The police report was amended July 22 to include the BAC results. Slimp said he also needed time to review the evidence.

Douglas County Attorney Don Kleine defended O’Connor a day before she resigned, telling the Omaha World-Herald she had “been an exemplary employee for our office.” He also described what happened as “something that is terrible and needs to be addressed.”
O’Connor, a 2015 graduate from Notre Dame Law School, told the local paper through her attorney last week that she decided to resign “after much reflection and support from trusted colleagues.”
“While I am proud of my work serving Douglas County, I do not want my pending legal matter to serve as a distraction from the fine work and service the Douglas County Attorney’s Office continues to provide our community,” she said in the statement.
O’Connor was booked into the Douglas County Department of Corrections at 9:31 p.m. on July 31. She appeared before a judge the following morning. A county official confirmed she was released after posting 10% of a $25,000 bond around 7 p.m. on Aug. 1. 
As a condition of her release, O’Connor must participate in Douglas County’s 24/7 Sobriety Program with daily monitoring and drug testing.
The Douglas County Court, with agreement from the prosecution and defense, waived a stipulation that O’Connor stay within 10 miles of the county. O’Connor’s next court date is Sept. 9 in Douglas County Court.
‘Everything she can to make it right’
NU Regent Paul Kenney, a Republican of Amherst and chair of the NU Board of Regents, said he would be as supportive as he could to O’Connor while not commenting on the criminal case.
“Just trying to be a friend and a colleague and do what I can to help,” Kenney said Monday.

Kenney and NU Regent Barbara Weitz of Omaha, who joined O’Connor on the board in 2019, told the Examiner that O’Connor has been through a tough time recently in her personal life, which Weitz described as a “year in hell.”
O’Connor was the youngest regent elected to the NU board in 2018, at 28 years old, and is one of just a handful of women to serve.
Weitz said the situation breaks her heart and that O’Connor “takes responsibility for making a bad choice, but she’s also doing everything she can to make it right.” Weitz said she remains supportive of O’Connor and that it is “imperative” that NU keep her as a regent. 
Second chances

  Regent Barbara Weitz of Omaha. Oct. 26, 2023. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
The board is officially nonpartisan, and regents are often unanimous in their votes, but the party breakdown on the board is 6 Republicans and 2 Democrats. O’Connor and Weitz are the two Democrats. 
In seven years — across hundreds of votes — only once has the board split 6-2 along party lines. That was in April, when the regents amended NU bylaws to try to comply with an order from President Donald Trump’s administration against higher education diversity, equity and inclusion policies. Weitz and O’connor opposed the changes.
O’Connor stands out among elected regents as having first served as a student body president and student regent for the University of Nebraska at Omaha, one of four students who serve in advisory roles to the board. She graduated from UNO in 2012.
Weitz described O’Connor as an “outstanding” regent, an “excellent” attorney and someone who has NU’s best interests in mind.
“Of all the people I know who deserve second chances, she tops the list,” Weitz said Monday. “We’d lose a great deal if we lose her.”

(Photo courtesy of Washington Department of Ecology)With groundwater in parts of eastern Washington declining at an alarming rate, a new study confirms which areas are most vulnerable to the problem and could help set clearer goals for recovery efforts.
The Washington State University study evaluated groundwater levels throughout the Washington portion of the Columbia Plateau Regional Aquifer System, which spans areas of Washington, Oregon and Idaho, and supplies up to a third of the region’s irrigation water.
Severe drought causing Utah reservoir levels to drop at ‘concerning’ rate

Researchers found that the Odessa region and the Yakima Basin in eastern Washington are seeing groundwater levels drop by at least 2 to 3 feet per year. The declines in those areas are primarily attributed to a combination of groundwater overuse and climate variability.
“This gives a quantitative target of how much water needs to be either put back into the ground or needs to be managed around to bring us back to some sort of steady condition,” said Sasha McLarty, study author and associate professor of civil and environmental engineering at Washington State University
The Washington state Department of Ecology estimates that groundwater supplies drinking water to over 60% of Washington residents.
 Odessa region shows most significant groundwater level decrease

Most municipalities have groundwater wells, and rural residents typically have wells on their properties, according to Jaime Short, section manager for the department’s Eastern Regional Office.
In eastern Washington, Short said, groundwater is primarily used for irrigated agriculture.
The Odessa region showed the most significant groundwater level decreases over the largest geographic area in Washington. The study notes that groundwater is the main water supply for the Odessa area.
If groundwater levels continue to decrease at their current rate, the Odessa region will likely lose 10% of accessible groundwater by 2040 and 50% within the next 70 years, according to the study.
The Yakima Basin showed steep declines in the deepest aquifer layer, making it more difficult to address the groundwater loss, McLarty said.
The study confirms what the Department of Ecology and local stakeholders have known for decades, said Department of Ecology hydrogeologist Chris Beard.
“Where it’s declining, it’s been declining for a long time,” Beard said.
 Mitigating declines in groundwater levels

In general, communities in areas where groundwater levels are dropping have already initiated efforts to mitigate and reverse the decline, Beard said.
The Department of Ecology and communities that depend on the Odessa Subarea Aquifer have been aware of declining groundwater levels since the 1960s, according to Smith.
A consortium of state, local and federal partners has been working since 2013 on a project to swap groundwater with surface water supplies from the Columbia River for agricultural users, so they can eventually stop using their wells.
The Odessa Groundwater Replacement Program secured nearly $45 million in this year’s capital budget to build a new irrigation system.
The project has so far eliminated the use of 16 wells and conserved 5.3 billion gallons of water annually in the Odessa Subarea Aquifer.
In the Yakima Basin, state, federal, tribal, business, and community organizations partnered in 2009 to develop the Yakima Basin Integrated Plan, which established a 30-year resource management strategy for the basin.
 Positive groundwater trends in areas of Spokane, the Lower Snake River and Klickitat

Of the 15 subareas in Washington included in the study, 12 showed groundwater levels dropping every year, while three — Spokane, the Lower Snake River and Klickitat — were found to be gaining water.
The positive trends in those areas are primarily due to active management and monitoring efforts, according to McLarty.
2024 settlement agreement protects most Idaho water users from curtailment, state says

While communities that know they’re losing groundwater have taken action to mitigate that loss, there are significant gaps in groundwater level data around the state.
“Our groundwater data measurements are actually pretty clustered in certain areas, so there are large parts of the state where we simply don’t have data,” Short said.
Most of those data gaps are in areas that are not heavily populated, according to Short.
Filling in those data gaps so researchers can track groundwater trends statewide over time is a goal for the Department of Ecology, Short said. The Washington State University study was part of the ongoing effort to do so.
It emerged from a legislatively-mandated project established in 2006, which calls for an estimate of current and future water supply and demand to be collected every five years.
This year’s study was the first to incorporate an observation-based analysis across the whole Columbia Basin Aquifer, McLarty said.
That strategy allowed researchers to document trends in different geographic areas of Washington, as well as trends within different layers of the aquifer, to better pinpoint where water is available and where it’s declining.
The study was also the first to take well infrastructure into account when determining what areas are vulnerable to groundwater loss.

(Otto Kitsinger for Idaho Capital Sun)After having provided unwavering support to programs that will prove harmful to our state and nation, Idaho’s top elected officials have found themselves in full-spin mode. Our Congressional delegation, although largely avoiding direct contact with voters in open town halls, have been using the Congressional recess to spin the effect of MAGA programs they supported.
Congressman Mike Simpson has been the most disappointing. As Idaho attorney general, I supported Mike’s run for the Idaho Legislature in 1984. He served honorably and intelligently for 14 years and has served in the U.S. House since 1989. Mike has done some good work over the years, at least until the Trump regime took over America’s government. Mike has become a loyal Trump sycophant in the House.
How Congress’s megabill will impact Idaho: Cuts to taxes, Medicaid, SNAP and more

In an Aug. 5 talk to the Idaho Falls Chamber of Commerce, Simpson lauded his support for the recently-passed “Big Beautiful Billionaire Bill”(BBBB). The bill extends forever the large tax cuts enacted in 2017, which were heavily skewed to the rich. 
Simpson blew off the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) calculation that the BBBB will add $3.5 trillion to America’s national debt, bringing our indebtedness to around 40 trillion dollars. Simpson claimed the “CBO is never right.” It is rather strange that Simpson placed reliance on the CBO cost estimate of the Fiscal Responsibility Act in 2023. The well-regarded Bipartisan Policy Center has verified the CBO determination.
Simpson continually wails about the ever-increasing national debt. His website says:
“The impact of an ever increasing national debt, if allowed to grow unchecked, can be disastrous for the economy. I am especially concerned that future generations of Americans will probably be the ones expected to pay down this debt.” His support for BBBB’s billionaire tax relief apparently takes priority over those future generations. Simpson bemoaned that “the biggest payment we make today is interest on the national debt, over a trillion dollars.” The BBBB will substantially increase that payment.
Simpson also wants to finance tax relief for the wealthy by cutting “wasteful Medicaid spending for illegal migrants and people who can work but refuse to.” He doesn’t seem to know that undocumented migrants cannot receive Medicaid assistance, except in limited emergency situations. 
And most adult Medicaid recipients are already working. According to reliable KFF research, “nearly two-thirds of adults ages 19-64 covered by Medicaid were working and nearly three in 10 were not working because of caregiving responsibilities, illness or disability, or due to school attendance.”  
Congressman Russ Fulcher, the most subservient member of Idaho’s MAGA delegation, enthusiastically supported the BBBB, even though his website says that America’s “escalating debt trajectory is unsustainable and poses significant risks to future generations.” Fulcher is the only member of the delegation who declined to oppose the sale of public lands in Idaho.
U.S. Sens. Jim Risch and Mike Crapo almost got themselves crosswise with the great majority of Idahoans by supporting a MAGA effort to sell public lands as part of the BBBB deliberations. When they saw that both of Montana’s Republican senators were against land sales and that most Idahoans hate the idea, they did a quick about face.
They both voted for the massive tax relief for the rich and for substantial cuts to medical care and nutrition assistance for struggling Idahoans. Sen. Crapo was the person who gave Simpson and other MAGA members of Congress the preposterous idea that the BBBB would not increase the national debt. Crapo used smoke-and-mirrors economics to reach that result. Both Risch and Crapo vociferously oppose spending that increases the national debt, but that must only apply when others do it.
The other MAGA problem facing Idaho and the rest of the nation is the chaotic tariff dance being conducted by Donald Trump. Congress has the constitutional authority for setting the country’s tariff policy, as well as controlling the nation’s purse strings. The MAGA Congress has completely abdicated its power and obligation on both counts. Trump unlawfully withholds spending on programs authorized by Congress and arbitrarily imposes tariffs that will hit American consumers in their pocketbooks. All of this goes on without a peep from our petrified MAGA delegation.
An Idaho businesswoman met with Sen. Crapo to outline the damage that Trump tariffs were wreaking on her business. He told her there was little he could do to help; his hands were tied because the president was going it alone. Crapo may have forgotten that he was chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over tax and trade policy. He certainly has the power to stop her pain.
Crapo and the rest of Idaho’s congressional delegation lack the courage to stand up for their state and country. Rather than fulfill their sacred oath to stand up for constitutional government, they spend their time spinning the destructive MAGA program. Perhaps it’s time for voters to put them out to pasture.

(Amelia Ferrell Knisely | West Virginia Watch)In Morgantown, volunteers have been using federal emergency funds to put people and families — typically single mothers and their children — in hotels, helping them avoid sleeping in their cars or on the streets.
The Ramp Hotel program has been almost exclusively funded by a federal emergency food and shelter program, which is now frozen by the Trump administration. The program is under review to ensure compliance with the president’s executive orders and new guidelines. 
Volunteers with the Ramp Hotel say that, following the federal funding freeze earlier this year,  they only have enough money to cover a few more hotel rooms for people who are on the verge of homelessness.
“We’re not dealing with dollars and cents here. We’re dealing with human dignity,” said Zac Morton, a pastor who co-founded the Ramp Hotel program in 2021. “To make cuts that directly take away tools that are helping the most vulnerable people in our populations, is essentially saying we don’t care about them.”
After paying for 795 nights of hotel stays, the program’s other co-founder, Brian Butcher, recently changed his voicemail to say the program will soon have to stop.
The Ramp Hotel program serves individuals who typically have nowhere else to go because local shelters are full or they’re unable to stay in a traditional shelter.
“There were always people who slipped through the cracks of the established emergency shelter program for all sorts of reasons,” Morton said. “Sometimes there were health concerns. Sometimes it was about keeping a family together.” 
Butcher said they most commonly help single mothers with kids, some who have ended up in Morgantown for medical appointments at the children’s hospital and don’t have a way to get home. 
“There is room for families in our current shelter, but it’s always full,” said Butcher, who serves as deputy mayor of Morgantown. He recalled getting a hotel room for a mom who was living in her car with seven children. 
“There’s a big gap we’re trying to fill,” he said.

The program works with local social service providers to first try to put people in traditional shelter spaces. Butcher and Morton recently provided a hotel stay for a family who lost their home to a fire and were waiting on an insurance check.
The Ramp Hotel program has been funded almost exclusively through the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) emergency food and shelter program. The funds have been indefinitely frozen since January as part of the broader halt on federal funding.
“This is our steady funding source that actually makes sure that we can do the program,” Butcher said. 
Because the Ramp Hotel program is run on a volunteer basis, Morton said that all of their federal funding has been used to pay for hotel rooms and food gift cards. He and Butcher spent around $17,000 last fiscal year on 269 hotel room nights and 288 meals.
Local United Way organizations have often doled out the federal emergency food and shelter program funds to organizations addressing homelessness. Courtney Summers, community impact director for the United Way of Monongalia and Preston Counties, said they’re waiting to hear about when the federal dollars will be available.

After starting the program with their own funds, Butcher and Morton said they’d now have to find completely new funding sources to keep the program running. They don’t think community donations would come in at the level they need.
Morton, who pastors First Presbyterian Church in Morgantown, said the program has less than $1,000 left in funding. He noted his program dissolving ultimately just puts more work and financial strain on Morgantown’s other homeless service providers. 
“We’ve helped keep people in a situation where they can stay sober. We’ve helped people get in a situation where they can find some stability and get a little bit of time before they find permanent housing,” Morton said. “To not have that just means that we have more people in more dire situations with less options than we had before.
He continued, “There are citizens in West Virginia who want to take care of each other, but we need to be cooperating with our governments to resource those kinds of efforts.”

Ken Yager of East Tennessee pleaded no contest Monday to drunk driving in Jekyll Island, Georgia, where he was arrested late last year on multiple charges.
Yager, 78, a Kingston lawmaker who serves as chairman of the Senate Republican Caucus, entered the plea through his attorney to the misdemeanor charge of DUI Less Safe, some nine months after his December 2024 arrest in affluent Glynn County, Georgia.
The court dismissed charges of hit and run, duty of a driver to stop or return to the scene of an accident, and failure to yield, according to a statement from Yager. The senator said he had completed 40 hours of community service and attended DUI school as part of the plea agreement in which he neither denied nor admitted guilt but accepted the punishment.
Yager expressed regret and apologized for the incident and said he failed to live up to his personal and professional principles, letting down his family, friends and constituents.
Sen. Ken Yager faces DUI, hit-and-run charges after Georgia arrest

“I take full responsibility for my actions on December 3rd. Drinking and driving is a very serious matter. It will never happen again,” Yager said in a statement.
The day of his arrest, Georgia state troopers were notified that a Ford Edge with Tennessee plates was allegedly involved in a hit-and-run incident on Jekyll Island. Troopers found the vehicle in a market parking lot of the beach resort town where emergency personnel were evaluating Yager, who tripped and fell, police reported.
DUI Less Safe is a charge of driving under the influence in which the prosecution can contend the motorist’s ability to drive was impaired even though their blood-alcohol content could be below the legal limit of .08%. Yager’s blood-alcohol content was recorded at .14%, and he refused a blood test after being arrested, according to the police report.
Yager told troopers he was involved in a crash earlier but that he thought everyone was OK and after talking to the other driver, he decided to leave the scene, not knowing police were en route, according to the incident report. He told officers he had drunk a couple of glasses of wine earlier in the day.
Because he pleaded to a misdemeanor charge rather than a felony, the lawmaker would not be subject to the Senate’s rules for expulsion.

(Christiana Botic/Verite News and Catchlight Local/Report for America)Increased restrictions on eligibility for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, introduced in President Donald Trump’s tax and spending law — known as the “One Big Beautiful Bill  — could put a universal free school meal program at risk for New Orleans public school students.
SNAP, previously known as food stamps, provides grocery benefits to low-income households, increasing access to healthy foods. But the program, which is administered at the federal level by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, also pays for in-school meals. Being enrolled in SNAP allows kids to automatically qualify for free school meals, reducing paperwork burdens for both school administrators and parents. Enrollment in other federal assistance programs, including Medicaid and Head Start, also directly qualify children for free meals.
The spending cuts to SNAP included in the bill, which Trump signed into law last month, are estimated to total $186 million over the next 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Like the cuts to Medicaid included in the law, those savings are achieved through administrative adjustments — which will likely result in lower enrollment — rather than direct funding cuts to the program.

Changes to program eligibility — such as increased work requirements and restrictions on noncitizen enrollment — will result in fewer adults and children enrolled in the program, according to Erin Hysom, a senior child and nutrition policy analyst with the Food Research and Action Center.
“SNAP provides a direct link between eligible children and free school meals,” Hysom said. “Cutting SNAP severs that link, resulting in increased paperwork burdens on schools and families and ultimately causing eligible children to fall through the cracks.”
Lower enrollment could jeopardize schools’ ability to participate in a government-funded universal free meal program, called the Community Eligibility Provision, in which the vast majority of schools across the state and in the city of New Orleans now participate.
Under the Community Eligibility Provision, when a certain percentage of low-income students directly qualify for free meals, all students at a school can enjoy free breakfast and lunch without being enrolled in SNAP themselves. In 2023, the United States Department of Agriculture, which administers SNAP and other nutrition programs, lowered the percentage of students needed to qualify for the Community Eligibility Provision from 40% to 25%. The rule took effect during the 2024-2025 school year, resulting in a surge of participating districts, according to a report to the Food Research and Action Center, which found that about 27.2 million students attended a participating school last school year, up 3.6 million from the year before.

Around 22% of New Orleans residents receive SNAP benefits. But over 90% of New Orleans public schools participate in the Community Eligibility Provision, the Food Research and Action Center found. In all but one of the participating schools, over 50% of students qualify for free lunches. But as cuts to Medicaid and SNAP are expected to take place over the next few years, that percentage of students might decrease, threatening all students’ automatic access to free meals.
Hysom said that the potential loss of free meal programs in schools will lead to increased stigma, higher school meal debt and more hunger in classrooms that lowers learning outcomes.
“We like to say that community eligibility creates hunger-free schools because CEP reduces the stigma that is often present in cafeterias when we categorize children by their household income,” Hysom said.
Brenda Watson, the business manager and director of food service at Fannie C. Williams Charter School in New Orleans East, which is enrolled for Community Eligibility Provision benefits, agreed. Last school year, 85% of the school’s students were on SNAP, Watson said.
“Most of the kids are thinking about survival,” Watson said. “This may be the best meal that they would get for that day. And so we try to recognize those kids. So just imagine if you’re asking them to pay, and they were already on SNAP, and food stamps. They don’t have money to pay, so you’re going to cut off everything that they have.”
Watson said she is concerned about cuts to federal programs that she learns about through the news, but that the state hasn’t passed down any information about cuts to SNAP specifically. She said the school relies on the state to transfer information about how federal grants will affect schools to administrators.
Danyelle Christmas, a parent from the Lower 9th Ward, received SNAP benefits for most of her childhood, and was again briefly enrolled in the program last year. (Christmas is currently running for the District E seat on the New Orleans City Council in the fall municipal elections.) She said the benefits she received helped keep her family afloat as her weekly grocery bills reached $150. Even though she doesn’t receive SNAP benefits anymore, Christmas said that free meals at her children’s daycare help ease burdens at home.
“So if funding is cut for the daycare, then now I may have to wake up early at 4:30 in the morning, and I’ll prepare breakfast, and it’s more draining on the parent and the household,” Christmas said. “So it trickles down in every which way possible, affecting everybody.”

(Photo courtesy of Justine Wilson)When Siri Fiske founded the Mysa Microschool in Washington, D.C., in 2016, there wasn’t a widely accepted term for her small, one-room schoolhouse model.
Now, the school is referred to on its website as one of the first microschools in the nation, and Fiske has seen a growing microschool movement since the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the five years since remote schooling amid pandemic-era lockdowns, microschools and homeschooling have emerged as increasingly popular alternatives to traditional public and private models. Smaller class sizes, individualized classrooms and lack of standardization are an appeal to parents, Fiske said.
“There’s this idea that people who open microschools are doing it for cultish or religious reasons, and there’s a misconception that all are like that,” Fiske said. “I’ve seen my students graduate into top colleges. There’s many ways to achieve academic success.”
Some education experts, however, have expressed concern about the growing movement. They question whether microschools are properly regulated and being held accountable, and whether they’ll pull dollars out of the public education system.
There is no federal definition of a microschool, and with the Trump administration’s plans to shutter the U.S. Department of Education, the onus is on states to figure them out.











Schools calling themselves microschools today are not what I would’ve called one back then. But I think that’s OK. It’s evolving.


– Siri Fiske, founder and head of Mysa School



In some states, microschools face a bind: If they operate as private schools, they’re required to meet facility, staffing and curricular standards that are often cost-prohibitive for schools their size. If they operate under homeschool laws, they face oversight, assessment mandates and reporting requirements that aren’t designed for multifamily or educator-led models.
Some states, including Georgia, Tennessee and Texas, have passed “Learning Rights Protection Acts” to codify microschools’ right to operate.
In Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts and Oregon, learning pods and microschools often face child care or private school licensing requirements if they involve multiple families, hire instructors or provide compensation for child care.
“Schools calling themselves microschools today are not what I would’ve called one back then. But I think that’s OK. It’s evolving,” Fiske said.
She pointed to the national school choice movement — and states such as West Virginia — for helping the microschool movement flourish.
In 2022, West Virginia became one of the few states to define a microschool, distinctly separating it from a private school, homeschool or learning pod.
Those classifications, and how these schools are funded and regulated, affect everything from whether a school must hire certified teachers to how it ensures student safety or civil rights protections. And with more public dollars flowing to private or hybrid learning options through vouchers and education savings accounts — to the detriment of public school funding, some argue — states will need to define these schools and their place in the ecosystem.
States will have to fill the gaps, said Weadé James, senior director of K-12 education policy with the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning policy think tank.
“Accountability can vary wildly. Some microschools aren’t required to have certified teachers, conduct annual assessments, or even guarantee civil rights protections,” said James. “If public voucher dollars are going to a microschool, there has to be some level of oversight and accountability.”
Many microschools aren’t accredited
Microschools defy easy classification, and many advocates argue that’s by design. Don Soifer, CEO of the National Microschooling Center, an industry group, cautions lawmakers against rushing to impose fixed legal definitions.
“Innovation is happening too fast. The moment you define it in law, it becomes obsolete,” Soifer said.
A 2024 sector analysis by the National Microschooling Center — one of the only sources of national data on the topic — found that many schools are operating outside traditional education principles.
In a survey of 400 microschools across 41 states, more than 60% of founders reported they were not currently licensed educators. Eighty-four percent reported their schools were not accredited. Among prospective founders, 48% are licensed educators (though only 14% currently work in public schools), 32% come from non-education fields, and 23% are parents building schools for their own children.
Most microschools (55%) operate under homeschool laws, while others function as private schools (37%), charters (6%) or fall into unique state categories (3%), according to the analysis.
“So, you can be a private or homeschool microschool program, where you aren’t required to provide students with certified teachers, or you aren’t required to conduct annual assessments,” James said.
Often described as “homeschool hybrids” or “small-scale learning communities,” microschools often serve around 16 students or fewer, and tend to cater to families with average or above-average incomes in their area. In some states, microschools have been authorized to receive public funds through voucher programs.
Some critics note that, like private schools, microschools may charge tuition, potentially excluding lower-income families and contributing to educational disparities.
These schools often operate in commercial spaces (41%), private residences (28%) or houses of worship (25%), according to the National Microschooling Center. The center also found the movement is diversifying: 37% of prospective founders are people of color, compared with 27% of current operators.
Because building and zoning codes vary from state to state and locality to locality, many operators may be unaware of the extra costs to meet school codes standards. Fiske recalls difficulties in expanding from Washington, D.C., to Vermont, which has stricter laws on water fountain requirements.
“Most people in the U.S. starting a microschool are doing it under the radar because the regulations to open a licensed school are so intense,” Fiske said. For the new school, she recalled, “it took us forever, and we had to install ADA-compliant toilets and water fountains for just 10 kids in Vermont.”
‘Microschooling is not one thing’
Microschools also operate in a legal gray zone, often outside the traditional K-12 system and subject to a patchwork of state and local policies that can either support or constrain their growth.
Growth has accelerated in conservative-leaning states with robust school choice programs, such as Arizona and Florida. Other states, such as Maryland, New York and North Dakota, have more restrictive homeschool or private school laws.
“Microschooling is not one thing. These schools look different in every state, and the policy frameworks around them vary wildly,” said Soifer, of the National Microschooling Center.
What is classified as a microschool can vary from “10 kids in a basement in Kentucky” to a 200-kid schoolhouse elsewhere.
Fiske said states need to create a way for operators and parents to know what to expect in a certain state, and help willing operators get the education and business acumen they need to run the schools successfully.
“But if you look at who is starting microschools in the U.S., it’s a lot of millennial parents who may not have any teacher training but wanted to create a learning environment for their children and others in the local community,” said Fiske. “And without efforts by the state to provide some incentives to earn accreditation and information as both a school and a small business, a few of these will find themselves going under.”
Seeking choices
After two decades working in conventional schools in the United States and around the world — including in Brazil, Egypt and Qatar — Justine Wilson turned down a high-paying leadership role at a prestigious private school. Instead, in 2023 she opened Curious and Kind Education, a two-day-a-week microschool in Sarasota, Florida, built around trust, nature-based learning and self-directed play.
Enrollment at Curious and Kind is mostly driven by word of mouth, she said. The program now has a waitlist. And Wilson has seen her enrollment grow from 18 students in her first year to roughly 100 students for the upcoming school year.
“The number of 5-year-olds on my waitlist is shocking,” she said, “and then I realized they’re COVID babies and their parents have really been driving this search for alternative schooling since the pandemic.”
James, of the Center for American Progress, questions whether microschools generally match the quality of traditional public schools, which still educate more than 80% of schoolchildren. She says families may be under the assumption that school choice options equate to better quality.
“We have created an illusion of choice to be quality, and I think a lot of families are seeking various choice options because they associate that with quality. But that doesn’t necessarily mean that where those students are going is any better than where they left,” she said.
“We need to take a closer look at what we are presenting to families,” James said. “It’s not just about having options and having a choice. It’s about having quality choice options.”
That quality, Soifer said, is what microschools are trying to achieve.
“Microschools do very well on the left, on the right … at the top end of the economy and at the fragile end of the income spectrum,” he said. “It’s really a matter of the new economy and a new way of thinking about education.”

LOUISVILLE — Ford Motor Company will invest nearly $2 billion to convert a longtime auto manufacturing plant in Louisville to build electric vehicles from a new platform adaptable to multiple vehicle types, aiming to launch a mid-sized EV pickup truck by 2027.
Ford President and CEO Jim Farley told an audience of plant workers, local and state elected officials and other representatives Monday inside the Louisville Assembly Plant that moving forward with the  “universal” EV platform was a risk, especially with global EV competition, but the company was investing in the future.
“We needed a rapid approach and a really tough challenge to create an affordable vehicle that delights customers in every way that matters,” Farley said. “We need to do it and be sustainable and make money, and we need to do it with American workers.”
Farley and other Ford executives said the EV truck would be priced starting at $30,000, would have an “amazing range” and be built through a newly designed assembly line to be created at the Louisville plant. The EV batteries for the new platform will be supplied from a Michigan battery plant. The new truck will have 20% fewer parts compared to internal combustion engine vehicles, allowing for significantly quicker assembly line production. The more efficient assembly line for electric vehicles, these executives said, would also mean less physical strain workers and less getting in and out of vehicles.
Farley was joined on stage by Democratic Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, who lauded the “massive investment” in the state. A release from Beshear’s office states Ford’s plant conversion would be the third largest economic development project in Kentucky’s history.

“This cutting-edge platform will be the foundation for the next generation of vehicles. The best part is, these vehicles will be affordable,” Beshear said. “They’re going to help so many American families keep more money in their pockets for groceries, medicine, school supplies and yes, even that family vacation.”
Leaders with United Auto Workers Local 862, representing workers at Ford’s Louisville Assembly Plant and Kentucky Truck Plant in Louisville said the newly designed assembly line for electric vehicles would cause some plant workers to lose their jobs in Louisville and have to take jobs at another Ford operation. The Louisville Assembly Plant currently builds two SUVs, the Ford Escape and Lincoln Corsair.
“It’s not nearly as drastic as they expected when they first came at us talking about an EV,” said Brandon Reisinger, the Louisville Assembly Plant building chair for the union. “I don’t foresee anybody hitting the street at all. I don’t know that our working number will be exactly the same it is now, but nobody’s gonna get laid off.”
  Brandon Reisinger with United Auto Workers Local 862 said he believed the low cost of charging electric vehicles can be convincing to consumers. (Kentucky Lantern photo by Liam Niemeyer)
Reisinger told reporters some of the work done elsewhere to preassemble cars before they arrive at the plant will be done at the plant with the new EV, offsetting the downsizing. He estimates the plant’s workforce will be about a couple hundred fewer people when the plant conversation is complete, also accounting for people who retire. Ford executives said 2,200 jobs at the plant will be “secured” with the conversion; about 3,300 workers are employed at the plant as of 2024, according to Ford.
Reisinger said he believes the conversion could begin at the end of the year with some workers temporarily unemployed during a few months of the conversion, but the union’s contract provides for supplemental unemployment benefits to workers worth about 80% of a paycheck.
When asked about political headwinds against electric vehicles from elected officials in the federal and state governments Reisinger pointed to the lower cost of charging an EV compared to filling up a gas tank as a compelling reason for EVs.
“I’m going to end up buying me one of these as well when we start building,” Reisinger said. “It’s going to be a very cost-effective vehicle to drive.”

(Photo by Alex Brandon - Pool/Getty Images)“Nobody knows the system better than me, which is why I alone can fix it,” said Donald Trump when he accepted the Republican presidential nomination in 2016. 
In just one presidential campaign, Trump bifurcated the Republican Party, built a movement on a foundation of purported populism and promised to advocate for frustrated Americans who felt their government had let them down. Almost a decade has passed, and Tennessee’s elected Republicans have fully embraced Trump, copying and pasting his messaging and claiming to stand up for everyday Tennesseans.
However, a closer look at the 940-page “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” (for which every Republican member of Tennessee’s federal delegation voted) provides evidence for how Trump’s movement is just a rebranded version of the same old GOP: a political party that will go to the mat for the wealthy while abandoning working-class voters.
What will the bill cost Tennesseans? On healthcare costs and related job loss
According to KFF, a nonprofit health policy organization, around 68,000 Tennesseans will lose access to federally subsidized healthcare due to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act’s changes to the Affordable Care Act’s (ACA) marketplace health insurance programs. The U.S. House Democrats’ Joint Economic Committee predicts more than double that number, or 170,000 Tennesseans, will lose coverage.
“Big Beautiful Bill” cuts to Medicaid, food aid raise alarm in Tennessee

KFF estimates another 45,000 Tennesseans will lose access to Medicaid as a result of the measure’s $7 billion in cuts to TennCare, Tennessee’s Medicaid program, over the next decade. The Joint Economic Committee says closer to 70,000 will lose Medicaid. Between ACA and Medicaid cuts, at least 110,000 Tennesseans are expected to lose healthcare due to the Big Beautiful Bill.
The cuts will have the greatest impact on rural communities. Nearly half of all rural hospitals in Tennessee operate at a loss, so cuts to Medicaid funding, which helps keep these hospitals operating, will be devastating, especially considering Tennessee already has the highest number of rural hospital closures per capita in the nation. 
Rural communities account for approximately 21% of the state’s population, or around 1.5 million Tennesseans. Far from Tennessee’s big cities, it is in these communities where the local hospital is often the best option for a good-paying job. When the hospital leaves, so do the jobs, triggering harmful economic ripple effects. According to one report, at least nine rural Tennessee hospitals are on the chopping block.
On nutrition assistance and related job loss
About 77% of Tennessee households currently receiving benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) already have someone in the household who is working, but Trump’s bill makes access to SNAP even more difficult by significantly increasing work requirements (including for single mothers and the elderly) while simultaneously making the implementation of SNAP more expensive for everyone. 
How did he pull that off? A provision of the legislation requires states to pay 75% of SNAP’s administrative costs by 2028 (up from 50%), meaning the Tennessee legislature will have to pull funds from another program or increase taxes on working Tennesseans to keep SNAP operating in the state.
SNAP is an economic driver in Tennessee (for every dollar spent on SNAP, about $1.50 is generated in Gross Domestic Product), so reductions to SNAP won’t just threaten food security for the most vulnerable among us: it will also come back to bite working Tennesseans on the employment side. Because the program employs agriculture and food retail workers, SNAP cuts in Tennessee will likely result in some job losses, especially in rural, agricultural communities.
On energy costs and related job loss
The Biden presidency’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) reduced energy costs and added jobs. Tennessee and other states won by Trump benefited the most from the growth of the clean energy economy, receiving 77% of the IRA investments made thus far and 78% of the jobs created thus far. Yet the Big Beautiful Bill does away with almost all clean energy investments, resulting in the loss of 530,000 jobs and the cancellation of $380 billion in planned clean energy investments.
Tennessee is in the top five states predicted to suffer the largest electricity price increases as a direct result of the new measure. According to the Center for American Progress, Tennesseans can expect electricity price increases greater than $200 by 2026.
Three charts showing the impact of the ‘Big, Beautiful Bill’ on Tennessee

On the jobs side, since 2022, Tennessee has enjoyed over 6,000 new clean energy jobs thanks to the IRA’s energy credits. The bill’s disruption to those credits could threaten jobs and undermine Tennessee’s efforts towards producing clean, affordable energy.
How will the bill benefit Tennesseans?
Trump supporters justify the bill’s sweeping cuts to healthcare, nutritional support and the clean energy economy by promising Americans lower taxes. And yes, an examination of U.S. Census household income data reveals that Tennessee may be on track to receive as much as $7 billion in income tax cuts in 2026. But who will benefit from the cuts? 
About 31% of the $7 billion in tax cuts will go to Tennessee households that make between $100,000 and $200,000 per year, even though those households represent only 24.1% of the state’s population. A whopping 45.8% of the $7 billion will go to Tennessee households that make more than $200,000 per year, even though those households represent just 8.6% of the population. Barely 20% of the tax cuts will go to working-class households making between $40,000 and $100,000 per year, despite those households representing the largest population demographic in the state.
Politicians have been selling out working-class Americans and serving the interests of the ultra-wealthy for generations. Tennessee’s elected officials are no different. Voters must put aside their cultural, often single-issue differences and work together to choose better candidates.
Working-class Tennesseans need elected leaders who represent their interests, not those of the monied few.

Josh Hawley, at the U.S. Capitol on Nov. 20, 2024 (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images).Before the leader of one of the most respected immigrant-rights organizations in the nation could get on a flight and come to Missouri, she was issued a threat by one of the state’s politicians.
U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley targeted Angelica Salas, executive director of the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles (CHIRLA), in June.
Hawley sent her a letter, questioning if the California organization she leads was “aiding and abetting criminal conduct.” Specifically, the claim was that her organization was “bankrolling civil unrest.”
Hawley’s letter blamed Salas for widespread protests in Los Angeles, the city’s pushback against immigration raids.
The senator demanded that CHIRLA provide a slew of records — emails, texts, media talking points, donor lists, strategies and any financial records of money that might have been spent in protesting the immigration raids carried out by Homeland Security and other federal agencies.
She came to Kansas City anyway.
Nation’s largest Latino civil rights organization meets in KC against backdrop of mass deportations

On Aug. 5, Salas was a speaker at the UnidosUS convention, the largest Latino civil rights and advocacy organization in the nation. Of all the invited participants, she drew the most fervent applause, second only to UnidosUS President and CEO, Janet Murguia.
Murguia is from Kansas City, Kansas, and comes from a well-known family with deep commitments to public service.
Salas’ session was packed, standing room only at the large convention center. She spoke boldly, unequivocally, detailing how in early June CHIRLA began hearing community reports of men, women and some children being held in the basement of a federal building because space had run out in the municipal detention center.
Raids were being conducted across L.A., she said, with federal agents taking people into custody suspecting that they were undocumented.
“We never imagined what was to come,” Salas said. “Our city was overtaken by a federal immigration military force of masked men in military convoys with automatic rifles and other armaments of war.”
The sweeps continued for more than 50 days, with roving patrols of federal agents rounding up people across the city, including at day labor sites and at bus stops.
“The terror only stopped because of our sustained protests,” Salas said – protests along with a class action lawsuit, she added, involving other civil rights organizations.
Shortly before she left L.A. to travel to Kansas City, a temporary restraining order was upheld by the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The order is to stop indiscriminate immigration stops and arrests in seven Southern California counties, including Los Angeles.
“The majority of the protests that brought thousands of people into the streets, they were peaceful, and they were nonviolent,” she said.
Salas’ deepest message was to a specific group.
Eight in 10 Latinos are U.S. citizens. At more than 66 million people, Latinos as a demographic are the nation’s largest minority group. Salas spoke to all of them.
“I stand before you and I ask you to fight for our rightful place in this country,” she said. “To use your social, your economic, your political power to stop these injustices and the brutality that has been unleashed against us all.”
Appearing on the same panel with Salas was David Huerta, president of the Service Employees International Union California. Huerta detailed how he had been arrested in June during a protest. He was held in jail for three days, charged with conspiracy to impede an officer, before being let out on bond.
“They hear your voices on the inside,” Huerta said. “Your voices do resonate when they are detained.”
He too emphasized a reaction of nonviolence as being essential to this moment as the Latino community resists the raids and sweeping arrests of undocumented people.
The following day, August 6, federal agents in L.A. conducted what has been called Operation Trojan Horse. Early in the morning, near a Home Depot store, agents were hidden in the back of a rented Penske truck. When the back door opened, they piled out to conduct a raid.
Reports are that more than a dozen immigrants were arrested on suspicion of being undocumented. That news broke long after the panel discussion ended and conference goers attended other sessions.
But it struck with weight in Kansas City.
One Saturday in late May, dozens of members of the white nationalist group Patriot Front had piled out rented U-Haul’s near downtown Kansas City and paraded themselves through the streets. Some carried Confederate flags and chanted about “reclaiming America.”
They didn’t stay long. Police, and citizens who began to protest the group’s presence, were soon on the scene.
But the masks the Patriot Front wore, their uniform outfits and certainly the use of the rented moving trucks, were eerily similar to the news footage of the agents who took part in the Trojan Horse operation in L.A.
The images, side by side, gave a chilling new weight to the challenge issued by Salas.
“This is a defining moment for the Latino community,” she said. “We belong here. This is our home.”

(Getty Images)When I heard that President Donald Trump is bringing back the Presidential Fitness Test, I felt sorry for children who will be put through that terrible program.
“This is a wonderful tradition, and we’re bringing it back,” Trump said of the fitness test. 
No. No it’s not.
The Presidential Fitness Test began in 1966 but was phased out during the Obama administration. Thanks Obama (no, for real, thank you). 
I enjoyed gym class most days. Four square, volleyball and crab soccer were all an absolute blast. But the days when everyone watched as I struggled to do a pull up, climb a rope or do a sit up made me hate exercise for years. As I fought to complete a sit-up in high school, I’ll never forget my gym teacher telling me I’d have real problems giving birth if I couldn’t do a sit-up. It felt just as inappropriate then as it does now.
As someone who isn’t gifted athletically, it wasn’t fun to fail those tests. And it was upsetting that my overall GPA was brought down because I wasn’t strong enough to climb a rope. 
It wasn’t until two years ago when I began going to a gym regularly that I realized that I do actually love to exercise. There was no pressure to do 10 sit ups — I was told to do what I could. Can’t do a push up? Try this alternative, it will help build strength so you can eventually do it. It’s supportive. There’s no feeling like a failure. 
Physical fitness is so important. There are ways to encourage this without tests. The Presidential Youth Fitness Program, which replaced the original test, promoted the health and physical fitness of children instead. 
Trump designated Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. to administer the Presidential Fitness Test.
Under Kennedy, the Trump administration is taking some non-traditional — and dangerous — approaches to health, such as firing experts on a vaccine panel, and replacing them with vaccine skeptics. 
Kennedy refers to his movement as Make America Healthy Again. The MAHA movement in West Virginia has yet to tackle any serious health issues, like our high rates of childhood obesity and diabetes. We have a severe lack of mental health care for our youth and food deserts that leave some families without access to fresh food. There are too many babies who are exposed to drugs while in the womb.
The MAHA website lists each action states have made as part of the MAHA agenda. So far, West Virginia has done two things — the West Virginia Healthy Schools Law, which bans certain artificial dyes from being used in food and the waiver that prevents SNAP benefits from being used to buy soda. 
West Virginia’s food and beverage industry warned that the food dye ban will lead to increased grocery prices and empty shelves because there’s not an abundance of alternative ingredients. 
Meanwhile 1 in 5 children in the Mountain State face hunger. According to Feeding America, charitable programs alone aren’t able to support people who face hunger — government assistance programs are necessary to help bridge the gap.
Almost 38% of households that receive SNAP benefits have children. And more than 67% of school-aged children qualify for free or reduced-priced meals.
The Mountain State has one of the highest rates of child obesity at almost 22%. The national average is 16.2%.
Preparing healthy foods and snacks is time-consuming and more parents are feeding their children fast food. A 2018 study found that low cost and increased value of fast-food meals, as well as convenience and easy access, lead to the increased consumption. 
Another report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevents found that Black and Hispanic kids eat more fast food than their white counterparts, and over one-third ate fast food on any given day.
“These are not surprising findings when you think about how strapped families are these days for both time and money, and how fast food can be an easy option for stressed families,” Dr. Eliana Perrin, professor of pediatrics at Duke University School of Medicine, told NBC News.
What could help fight childhood obesity and diabetes? Getting children outside more to play, but because of climate change it’s often too hot to safely play outside for long periods. 
Making healthy food cheaper would be another great option instead of banning foods from SNAP recipients. Congress’ Farm Bill actually makes burgers cheaper than salads. 
There’s not just one way to improve the health of West Virginians. But a step in the right direction would be to listen to health experts over conspiracy theorists. It’s hard to have the strength to pass a fitness test when you’re not getting enough to eat.

And he wants his ongoing lawsuit against the city and county to hurt.
Eric Meyer appeared on the Kansas Reflector podcast to talk about how things have changed since the Aug. 11, 2023, raid, when police stormed the newsroom under the false pretense that a reporter had committed identity theft by looking up a driving record in a public online database. They took computers and reporters’ personal cellphones, acting outside the scope of a search warrant that was issued in disregard for the U.S. Constitution and state and federal laws that protect journalists.

The raid spawned one state and five federal lawsuits, as well as a criminal charge against Gideon Cody, the former police chief who led the raid. The legal action continues to unfold as attorneys battle in federal court and a hearing in Cody’s case is scheduled for this fall.
Following is an edited and abbreviated Q&A from the podcast with Meyer.
 How has your life changed in the past two years?

You don’t have long enough in your podcast to explain it all. It has changed massively. In addition to the practical side of it, that I’ve had a lot of places I’ve gone, a lot of speeches I’ve given, a lot of other things that have gone on, but just the work of it. You know, this was my retirement gig. I was going to come here and do this part-time for fun.
 What could be more fun than this?

Well, it is fun. I at one point said that my mother, who died as a result of the stress of the raid, had an opportunity at 98 to go out meaning something in her life. But it’s nice as a retiree to be out here doing something, of still meaning it somehow or another, trying to keep trying — maybe as Don Quixote — to keep journalism alive. But we are trying our hardest to not bow to pressures and still get good journalism out there. And it really is a battle.
 What are some of the revelations that have come out since we last checked in with you about this time a year ago?

Not as many as you’d think. We’re still literally blocked from discovery in our federal court lawsuits, which means we can’t go out and interrogate people that we think have information that would be relevant to the case. And part of this is being able to figure out the degree to which political people, elected officials and others, helped push this raid along.
 This is important because there’s sort of been a narrative at times to pin this all on one rogue police chief, but I think the evidence clearly shows that one guy can’t do this in isolation. It was a coordinated effort.

Exactly. And I really object when that thought comes up, that this was just Gideon Cody who did this. And yeah, he did a lot of it himself. But there were people within law enforcement who helped him, people in elected positions, people in judicial court positions, who could have and should have stopped him, and they didn’t. Now, was it because they were not courageous? They didn’t want to make waves? Or was it that they agreed with him? Or was it that that they were just incompetent to what’s going on? I don’t know. That would be nice to find out.
 Where do things stand in your case?

It’s abundantly clear from the rulings of the judge so far in the case on various motions of dismissal that we’ve probably won the case.
The most telling of these things was we had sued the city of Marion for failing to provide training to its police officers about the Privacy Protection Act, which says that you’re supposed to get subpoenas, not warrants, to raid newsrooms. And the judge threw that out, saying any fool who’d be a cop should know this automatically and without requiring specialized training.
And there are overtures now to try to settle — some official, some unofficial. I’m eager to get the thing done. But there are things other than financial damages at stake here. So there needs to be some admissions. There need to be things that are reported to licensing authorities for police officers other than Gideon Cody.
 Are you committed to not settling, to seeing this out through trial?

The real reason we wanted to go to trial was we wanted a ruling on the record that acknowledges that this is something you just don’t do. And if they are willing to provide that as a stipulation, we might accept that. This has never been about money.
This is about making sure that people understand what they did was wrong, admit that publicly. Set it as an example. And somehow or other, it needs to hurt. One of our concerns is that they’ll want to settle up to the limit of their insurance coverage. Well, that really means you did nothing. I mean, it really probably needs to go a little beyond insurance. Now, we don’t want to bankrupt the city or county of Marion by any manner or means. But something that has a little pain to it.
 Do you feel like you still have strong community support?

I think everybody, including me, would like to see this over. But they’re very supportive of us. They just don’t like the fact that it looks like we’re hickville. And to be honest, I think that’s a very unfair assumption. I think that Marion and Marion County are not hickville. Some things that went on in Marion and Marion County that probably go on in a lot of other counties have been exposed. We just don’t hear about them in other counties.
And to an extent, Marion County should take pride in the fact there here, we’ve had a situation where somebody tried to trample on rights, and it didn’t happen. We fixed it. We’re in the process of fixing it. So you can take pride in that. It’s not where cops were stupid and raided a newsroom. It’s where somebody tried something stupid and, you know what? They didn’t get away with it. I think that’s a point of pride, but it would be nice to be known for something else.
 I think it’s worth pointing out that accountability journalism put you in the crosshairs of police for this raid. But this is the role that journalists need to embrace, right, in this current climate?

Oh, absolutely.
I’m sorry to tell this to a group of people out there: There are facts. And some things are facts. And your opinion of the fact doesn’t change whether it’s a fact or not. And you have to pay attention to the nuances. You have to pay attention to the little things.
 You and your late mother were inducted in the Kansas Press Association Hall of Fame last year. I went to the induction ceremony, where you gave this speech, shortly after the election in November, and you gave a sort of rallying cry to journalists. You said: “Make democracy great again.” Are journalists rising to meet this moment?

Some are, when they still have money to do it. I mean, closing the Corporation for Public Broadcasting is going to silence a great number of people in public media. Corporations are going to take care of silencing a great number of people elsewhere.
We need to have people aggressively going out and finding out what’s wrong. We had a story this week: They applied a new coating of pavement to the main road that leads to Pilsen, which is the home of Emil Kapaun, the man who’s about to be sainted as a Korean War hero. And it didn’t stick, and the road is now basically untravellable. Did they tell us about it? No! We had to find out about it. And now it’s a game of finger-pointing.
Journalists have joined this Gen Z thing: “We don’t want to embarrass anybody. Oh, my goodness, somebody might take offense if we run this story.” And so they don’t want to do it, and their corporate bosses say, “Oh yeah, they might cancel their ads. Oh, we can’t do that.” So we make our news publications and news broadcasts and other things so dull that nobody wants to read them anymore or listen to them anymore.
I used to say this as a journalism professor — that’s why I came here in my retirement, was that I think there’s still a place in this world for regular, good old-fashioned journalism. And this is from somebody who taught online and stuff like that in school. I said, “We’ve wasted too much time worrying about that stuff, and not enough time worrying about the substance of what we’re reporting. And get out there and get interesting things that matter to people and tell us about them.”
So I said, “Well, I can’t solve it for the world, but maybe I can make a little demonstration project out here that we can try to do it. And of course, somebody says, “Yeah, and what happened to you: You get raided.” Yeah, that’s true. But the raiding gives us more attention.
I may be quixotic in some regards and Pollyannaish in another, but the raid drew attention to the fact that we’re actually trying to do good journalism. So there’s a positive outcome to the raid.

(Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)In a sweeping policy shift that could reshape labor relations at one of the largest federal agencies, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs has terminated collective bargaining agreements for most of its unionized workforce, citing a need to better serve veterans and implement long-stalled management reforms.
The decision, announced last week, follows an executive order from President Donald Trump that excludes certain agencies from labor-management relations programs on national security grounds.
The VA said it acted under that order to end union contracts covering hundreds of thousands of employees represented by five major labor organizations, including the American Federation of Government Employees, the National Association of Government Employees, the National Federation of Federal Employees, National Nurses United, and the Service Employees International Union.
The impact could be particularly significant in North Carolina, which is home to more than 600,000 veterans and has more than 17,000 VA employees working in hospitals, clinics, and benefits offices across the state — including major medical centers in Asheville, Durham, Fayetteville and Salisbury.
North Carolina state Sen. Val Applewhite, a Democrat who represents Cumberland County which is home to Fort Bragg, said she was not surprised that the Trump administration would target collective bargaining, but is “disappointed” that he chose to start with the VA.
“This president clearly has no boundaries, and clearly has no shame, and clearly has no respect for veterans,” she said. “If we don’t stand up this midterm and make some adjustments in Congress, we’re going further and further down into this deep, dark hole,” Applewhite said.
“How many lives will be impacted?” she asked “How many veterans could die or linger with medical issues because of this?”
While the VA will maintain agreements for approximately 4,000 police officers, firefighters and security guards — occupations exempt from the executive order — the vast majority of bargaining-unit employees across the country are now operating without formal union contracts.
The move drew swift criticism from labor groups but was celebrated by Trump allies and VA leadership as a long-overdue realignment of priorities at an agency that serves more than 9 million veterans annually.
“This decision is good news for Veterans, families, caregivers and survivors,” VA Secretary Doug Collins said in a statement. “Too often, unions that represent VA employees fight against the best interests of Veterans while protecting and rewarding bad workers. We’re making sure VA resources and employees are singularly focused on the job we were sent here to do: providing top-notch care and service to those who wore the uniform.”
VA officials said the decision will allow managers to more effectively reward high performers, hold poor performers accountable and eliminate bureaucratic hurdles to hiring and reform.
According to the agency, more than 1,900 VA employees collectively spent over 750,000 hours on union activity during fiscal year 2024 — time that was compensated with taxpayer dollars.
Additionally, the agency cited the use of over 187,000 square feet of VA office and clinical space by union representatives, free of charge, as a significant cost burden. Officials said those resources — which also include union access to government phones and computer systems — should be redirected to patient care and veteran services.
The move also halts payroll deductions for union dues for most employees, a change that took effect on April 25 in compliance with the executive order.
Labor organizations say the agency is turning its back on frontline workers, many of whom are veterans themselves, and warned that terminating collective bargaining agreements will degrade working conditions and compromise patient care.
“This is a direct attack on the rights of the people who care for our nation’s veterans,” Irma Westmoreland, chair of National Nurses United, told Axios. “Without a contract, nurses fear they won’t be empowered to speak up about conditions that put our patients at risk.”
Democratic U.S. Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia called the decision “shortsighted, counterproductive, and disrespectful to those who’ve worn the uniform,” warning that gutting collective bargaining rights would make it even harder for the agency to recruit and retain skilled professionals amid staffing shortages and rising demand for care.
Applewhite, a 20-year veteran of the U.S. Air Force, had similar concerns. The N.C. state senator said she had recently spoken with a constituent unable to get treatment through the VA for a brain bleed and partial blindness after three months of waiting. Now, veterans are frequently referred to the civilian market due to capacity issues at the VA, something Applewhite has witnessed herself as a disabled veteran.
“One of the things that helped me to stay 20 years, one of the carrots that are dangled at the end of this long journey is that you will have access to health care,” Applewhite said. “Now, it’s looking less and less attractive — like, so you mean to tell me this health care now takes me three months to get an eye appointment?”
The VA contends that unions have consistently resisted efforts to modernize the agency and hold employees accountable.
Officials noted that the American Federation of Government Employees, the National Federation of Federal Employees  and National Nurses United opposed the bipartisan MISSION Act, which expanded veterans’ access to private-sector care. The National Federation has also supported repealing the 2017 VA Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act, which was designed to speed disciplinary action against employees and protect whistleblowers.
According to the VA, the American Federation of Government Employees collaborated with the administration of former President Joe Biden to reinstate over 100 employees who were fired during Trump’s first term and helped secure nearly $134 million in back pay for more than 1,700 employees dismissed for alleged misconduct.
Labor advocates counter that these laws have been misused to retaliate against whistleblowers and sidestep due process protections, particularly during the Trump administration.
The action makes the VA the first federal agency to fully sever collective bargaining agreements under the Trump-era executive order, a move made possible by language exempting agencies involved in “national security” functions.
Axios reported that the decision could affect up to 400,000 workers — roughly a quarter of the federal workforce with union protections.
While the full impact of the VA’s action remains to be seen, labor leaders and policy analysts expect legal challenges and a new round of political fights over the balance between government efficiency and worker protections.
For now, the department insists its mission is clear.
“This is about putting veterans first,” said Collins. “And if that means upsetting union bosses who’ve been standing in the way of reform, so be it.”

But that may soon change. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is pushing to ban 7-hydroxymitragynine, or 7-OH — a powerful compound found in small amounts in kratom and sometimes concentrated or synthesized in products sold online, at smoke shops or behind gas station counters.
Federal health officials announced last month that the compound poses serious public health risks and should be classified as a Schedule I controlled substance, alongside heroin and LSD.
The move marks a significant shift in how federal regulators are approaching kratom, which they attempted to ban in 2016. It also has sparked debate about how the change could impact the growing 7-OH industry and its consumers.
This year, at least seven states have considered bills to tighten kratom regulations, including proposals for bans, age restrictions and labeling requirements. North Dakota lawmakers considered a bill to ban kratom but the legislation failed. Lawmakers passed a bill that called for an optional study, but Legislative Management did not select the topic for a study this interim.

Kratom, which originates from the leaves of a tree native to Southeast Asia, can have a wide range of mental and bodily effects, according to federal officials, addiction medicine specialists and kratom researchers. Reports of fatal kratom overdoses have surfaced in recent years, though kratom is often taken in combination with other substances.
Kratom and 7-OH are distinct products with separate markets, but they are closely connected. 7-OH is a semi-synthetic compound derived from kratom and only emerged on the market in late 2023, while kratom itself has been available for decades.
Leading kratom researchers also say more research is needed to fully understand the long-term effects of using both substances.
“There’s much we don’t know, unfortunately, on all sides,” said Christopher R. McCurdy, a professor of medicinal chemistry at the University of Florida. McCurdy is a trained pharmacist and has studied kratom for more than 20 years.
Research suggests kratom may help with opioid withdrawal and doesn’t seem to cause severe withdrawal on its own. Smaller amounts seem to act as a stimulant, while larger doses may have sedative, opioidlike effects. Very little is known about the risks of long-term use in humans, according to McCurdy.
As for 7-OH, it shows potential for treating pain, but it hasn’t been studied in humans, and it may carry a high risk of addiction. Researchers don’t yet understand how much is safe to take or how often it should be used, McCurdy told Stateline.
While some leading kratom experts agree that kratom and 7-OH should be regulated, they caution that placing 7-OH under a strict Schedule I classification would make it much harder to study — and argue it should instead be classified as Schedule II like some other opioids.
A federal survey from 2023 estimated that about 1.6 million Americans age 12 and older used kratom in the year before the study. The American Kratom Association, a national industry lobbying group, estimated in 2021 that between 11 million and 16 million Americans safely consume kratom products each year.
Since gaining popularity in recent years, 7-OH has appeared in a growing number of products. Some researchers and addiction medicine specialists say many consumers, especially those new to kratom, sometimes don’t understand the difference between products.
“It’s a pure opioid that’s available without a prescription, so it’s akin to having morphine or oxycodone for sale at a smoke shop or a gas station,” McCurdy said. “This is a public health crisis waiting to happen.”
Federal crackdown targets 7-OH, not kratom
In late July, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommended that the federal Drug Enforcement Administration place 7-OH in Schedule I, citing a high potential for abuse. The classification would not apply to kratom leaves or powders with naturally occurring 7-OH.
“We’re not targeting the kratom leaf or ground-up kratom,” FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said at a news conference. “We are targeting a concentrated synthetic byproduct that is an opioid.”
Makary acknowledged that there isn’t enough research or data to fully understand how widespread 7-OH’s use or impact may be. Still, he said the Trump administration wants to be “aggressive and proactive” in addressing the issue before it grows into a larger public health problem.
While only small amounts of 7-OH occur naturally in the kratom plant, federal officials have raised concerns about U.S. products containing synthetic or concentrated forms of the compound because it’s more potent than morphine and primarily responsible for kratom’s opioidlike effects.
The FDA’s recommendation to schedule 7-OH will now go to the DEA, which oversees the final steps of the process — including issuing a formal proposal and opening a public comment period.
If finalized, the rule could affect both companies selling enhanced kratom products and consumers in states where those products are currently legal.
Pain relief or a problem? North Dakota lawmakers hear kratom debate

The DEA backed off scheduling kratom compounds in 2016 after widespread public opposition.
Kirsten Smith, an assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Johns Hopkins University who is studying kratom’s effects in humans, said she was surprised by the FDA’s push to schedule 7-OH.
“We don’t really have a public health signal of a lot of adverse events for either kratom or for 7-OH at this time,” she told Stateline. “I was, frankly, always surprised that kratom was pushed toward scheduling at an earlier time point. … I don’t know that we have data to support scheduling even now.”
Still, some advocacy groups, including the Holistic Alternative Recovery Trust, argue the push to schedule 7-OH is driven more by corporate interests than public health, suggesting the kratom industry is trying to sideline competition from 7-OH products.
“We think that this is just happening because of the legacy kratom manufacturers losing market share and wanting to gin up a crisis with this,” said Jeff Smith, the national policy director for the group, who said he has used 7-OH for sleep and pain management.
While his organization supports regulation and safe consumption, members worry the federal government’s move could drive people to riskier substances or push the market underground.
“It’s made a profound difference in my life,” Smith said. “We think it would be tragic to cut it off based on such a paucity of data when there’s so much potential for this product to help people.”
Public health concerns
Federal health officials say a key concern is the growing use of kratom and 7-OH products among teens and young adults.
Some officials and addiction medicine specialists have pointed out that these products often come in flavors and packaging designed to appeal to younger buyers, with few controls over where or how they’re sold. In some states without clear regulations, kratom and 7-OH products are available at gas stations or online, sometimes without any age verification.

“Whenever you go into a gas station and even though it’s behind the glass, it’s kind of eye level, and it has all of these bright colors — it has all of these things that really attract the visual of a kiddo,” said Socorro Green, a prevention specialist with Youth180, a nonprofit focused on youth substance use prevention in Dallas.
Green added that kratom and 7-OH products may be even more accessible to young people in rural communities, where gas stations and convenience stores are often among the few available retailers.
Some researchers and experts say that certain products may not clearly or accurately disclose their 7-OH content and are sometimes marketed or mistaken for traditional kratom.
Some cities, counties and states have responded by banning kratom or raising the minimum purchase age to 18 or 21. But in many areas, enforcement remains inconsistent, and some addiction specialists say clearer federal and state guidance is needed — especially as more people are using kratom and 7-OH to manage pain, anxiety or withdrawal symptoms on their own.
“There needs to be some kind of oversight, including some way of maybe helping to ensure that people know what they’re getting,” said Terrence Walton, the executive director and chief executive officer of NAADAC, the Association for Addiction Professionals.
State regulations
At least seven states have considered or enacted legislation this year related to kratom — ranging from age restrictions and labeling requirements to outright bans.
In New York, lawmakers passed two bills: one requiring warning labels and prohibiting kratom products from being labeled as “all natural,” and another raising the minimum purchase age to 21. Neither has been sent to the governor.
In Colorado, a new measure, which was signed into law in May, prohibits kratom from being sold in forms that resemble candy or appeal to children, increases labeling requirements, limits concentrations of 7-OH, and bans the manufacture and distribution of synthetic or semi-synthetic kratom.
In Mississippi, a new law that took effect in July raised the minimum purchase age for kratom to 21. It also bans synthetic kratom extracts and products with high concentrations of 7-OH. Lawmakers in Montana and Texas introduced similar legislation this year, but neither proposal advanced.
Louisiana is the latest state to enact a kratom ban, which took effect Aug. 1. Meanwhile, in July, Rhode Island became the first state to reverse its ban. The new law establishes a regulatory framework for the manufacturing, sale and distribution of kratom products, set to take effect in April 2026.
As of this year, Washington, D.C., and seven states — Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Louisiana, Rhode Island (until April 2026), Vermont and Wisconsin — have banned kratom. At least half of U.S. states now regulate kratom or its components in some way.

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)For millions of years, water flowing through the Colorado River shaped the geography of the West, carving out features like the Grand Canyon. Now, the Colorado River sustains the cities, farms and industries of the southwestern U.S., providing 40 million people with water. The river winds through canyons, alpine tundras, deserts and forests, underpinning ecosystems, vitalizing trout fisheries, feeding migratory birds and maintaining river deltas.
The Colorado River is remarkable in and of itself, it lays the foundation for remarkable habitats, and, apparently, can precipitate remarkable political alliances. This month, all 10 of Colorado’s U.S. legislators, from the most progressive representatives to MAGA Lauren Boebert, sent a letter to President Donald Trump calling for the release of funding for Colorado River water projects.
The water in the Colorado River is distributed among seven Western states, separated into two groups — Upper Basin and Lower Basin states — via terms established in a 1922 compact. Individuals and businesses within those states are allocated water by the doctrine of prior appropriation, which, in Colorado, was established in 1876. The prior appropriation doctrine grants permanent rights to (surface) water on a first come, first served basis, more frequently known as “first in time, first in right” — although the true first-comers, Native Americans, were excluded from the doctrine and only secured water rights through a series of lawsuits throughout the 20th century.

There are many faults with the 1922 Colorado River Compact and prior appropriation doctrine, but one of the greatest is that the river is perpetually over-allocated. In fact, the Colorado River is dammed and diverted to such an extent that most years it fails to reach the Pacific Ocean. When government officials estimated how much annual flow was available for use back in 1922, they settled on 20 million acre-feet — nearly double the approximately 12 million acre-feet flowing through the river today.
Three-quarters of water diverted from the Colorado River irrigates farmland, and 62% of that is used for hay to feed dairy and beef cows in the U.S., China, Japan, Saudi Arabia and elsewhere. Over the years, existing water rights have been concentrated into fewer hands. About 20 farming families, producing mostly hay, control about 15% of the water allocated to Lower Basin states. One family in California’s Imperial Valley uses more water than the entire Las Vegas metropolitan area annually — again, mostly to grow hay.
Climate change is exacerbating the Colorado River water shortage by extending droughts and aridifying the Southwest. That’s why the $150 million appropriated to Colorado for water projects to improve drought resiliency, ecosystem conservation, and aging infrastructure is so essential. The projects — awarded to coalitions of local governments, tribes and nonprofits — would benefit agriculture, recreationists, municipalities, endangered species … and ultimately all of the stakeholders reliant upon the Colorado River. The Trump administration’s decision to withhold the funding while re-reviewing the projects benefits nobody and hurts everybody, thereby instigating a true bipartisan effort to release the funds.
The money allocated to Colorado’s water projects represents only a small portion of the $4 billion set aside in the Biden administration’s 2022 Inflation Reduction Act for Colorado River water conservation programs. Much of that money was spent on direct payments to farmers for not using their full “water rights” — instead, the farmers were compensated for letting acreage go fallow. This program and its sudden end under the Trump administration demonstrate several points. One, that the nation’s food supply does not rely on all farmers in the West maximizing their yields. Two, that local and state officials cannot rely on federal funding to solve the Colorado River water shortage. And, three, that voluntary solutions that work within the current framework of water allocation are not sustainable or sufficient in the long run.
Ultimately, the federal government should release the owed water project funding — what better use is there for taxpayer dollars than ensuring Western communities have access to plentiful drinking water, vibrant ecosystems and healthy economies? But also, the only way to truly confront this water crisis is a paradigm shift; a reallocation of the river’s water, not just among states, but also uses. The prior appropriation doctrine was designed to stimulate industrial and colonialist expansion. It’s an inappropriate framework to handle modern priorities of sustainability, conservation and equity. Undermining certain tenets of the doctrine is warranted.
Solutions — many of which are controversial — exist, like charging more for using water that isn’t beneficial to the region or country (e.g., irrigating alfalfa to feed Saudi Arabian cattle) or outlawing wasteful irrigation techniques. Bold policies are needed to preserve the remarkable Colorado River and life in the West. Stakeholders must rethink current systems of water allocation.

(Photo courtesy of Justine Wilson)When Siri Fiske founded the Mysa Microschool in Washington, D.C., in 2016, there wasn’t a widely accepted term for her small, one-room schoolhouse model.
Now, the school is referred to on its website as one of the first microschools in the nation, and Fiske has seen a growing microschool movement since the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the five years since remote schooling amid pandemic-era lockdowns, microschools and homeschooling have emerged as increasingly popular alternatives to traditional public and private models. Smaller class sizes, individualized classrooms and lack of standardization are an appeal to parents, Fiske said.
“There’s this idea that people who open microschools are doing it for cultish or religious reasons, and there’s a misconception that all are like that,” Fiske said. “I’ve seen my students graduate into top colleges. There’s many ways to achieve academic success.”
Some education experts, however, have expressed concern about the growing movement. They question whether microschools are properly regulated and being held accountable, and whether they’ll pull dollars out of the public education system.
There is no federal definition of a microschool, and with the Trump administration’s plans to shutter the U.S. Department of Education, the onus is on states to figure them out.










Schools calling themselves microschools today are not what I would’ve called one back then. But I think that’s OK. It’s evolving.


– Siri Fiske, founder and head of Mysa School


In some states, microschools face a bind: If they operate as private schools, they’re required to meet facility, staffing and curricular standards that are often cost-prohibitive for schools their size. If they operate under homeschool laws, they face oversight, assessment mandates and reporting requirements that aren’t designed for multifamily or educator-led models.
Some states, including Georgia, Tennessee and Texas, have passed “Learning Rights Protection Acts” to codify microschools’ right to operate.
In Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts and Oregon, learning pods and microschools often face child care or private school licensing requirements if they involve multiple families, hire instructors or provide compensation for child care.

 Arkansas defines microschools
The rules governing Arkansas’ Educational Freedom Account program define a “micro-school” as “a tuition-based organization that serves a community of homeschool students, simultaneously in the same space, and that maintains responsibility for employing instructors or facilitators to provide part-time or fulltime academic services.”
The voucher program rules require microschools to teach the core academic subjects of math, English language arts, social studies and science.
The rules also specify that a microschool “is not a learning pod, a daycare facility, or a private school.”


“Schools calling themselves microschools today are not what I would’ve called one back then. But I think that’s OK. It’s evolving,” Fiske said.
She pointed to the national school choice movement — and states such as West Virginia — for helping the microschool movement flourish.
In 2022, West Virginia became one of the few states to define a microschool, distinctly separating it from a private school, homeschool or learning pod.
Those classifications, and how these schools are funded and regulated, affect everything from whether a school must hire certified teachers to how it ensures student safety or civil rights protections. And with more public dollars flowing to private or hybrid learning options through vouchers and education savings accounts — to the detriment of public school funding, some argue — states will need to define these schools and their place in the ecosystem.
States will have to fill the gaps, said Weadé James, senior director of K-12 education policy with the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning policy think tank.
“Accountability can vary wildly. Some microschools aren’t required to have certified teachers, conduct annual assessments, or even guarantee civil rights protections,” said James. “If public voucher dollars are going to a microschool, there has to be some level of oversight and accountability.”
 Many microschools aren’t accredited

Microschools defy easy classification, and many advocates argue that’s by design. Don Soifer, CEO of the National Microschooling Center, an industry group, cautions lawmakers against rushing to impose fixed legal definitions.
“Innovation is happening too fast. The moment you define it in law, it becomes obsolete,” Soifer said.

A 2024 sector analysis by the National Microschooling Center — one of the only sources of national data on the topic — found that many schools are operating outside traditional education principles.
In a survey of 400 microschools across 41 states, more than 60% of founders reported they were not currently licensed educators. Eighty-four percent reported their schools were not accredited. Among prospective founders, 48% are licensed educators (though only 14% currently work in public schools), 32% come from non-education fields, and 23% are parents building schools for their own children.
Most microschools (55%) operate under homeschool laws, while others function as private schools (37%), charters (6%) or fall into unique state categories (3%), according to the analysis.
“So, you can be a private or homeschool microschool program, where you aren’t required to provide students with certified teachers, or you aren’t required to conduct annual assessments,” James said.
Often described as “homeschool hybrids” or “small-scale learning communities,” microschools often serve around 16 students or fewer, and tend to cater to families with average or above-average incomes in their area. In some states, microschools have been authorized to receive public funds through voucher programs.
Some critics note that, like private schools, microschools may charge tuition, potentially excluding lower-income families and contributing to educational disparities.
These schools often operate in commercial spaces (41%), private residences (28%) or houses of worship (25%), according to the National Microschooling Center. The center also found the movement is diversifying: 37% of prospective founders are people of color, compared with 27% of current operators.
Because building and zoning codes vary from state to state and locality to locality, many operators may be unaware of the extra costs to meet school codes standards. Fiske recalls difficulties in expanding from Washington, D.C., to Vermont, which has stricter laws on water fountain requirements.
“Most people in the U.S. starting a microschool are doing it under the radar because the regulations to open a licensed school are so intense,” Fiske said. For the new school, she recalled, “it took us forever, and we had to install ADA-compliant toilets and water fountains for just 10 kids in Vermont.”
 ‘Microschooling is not one thing’

Microschools also operate in a legal gray zone, often outside the traditional K-12 system and subject to a patchwork of state and local policies that can either support or constrain their growth.
Growth has accelerated in conservative-leaning states with robust school choice programs, such as Arizona and Florida. Other states, such as Maryland, New York and North Dakota, have more restrictive homeschool or private school laws.
“Microschooling is not one thing. These schools look different in every state, and the policy frameworks around them vary wildly,” said Soifer, of the National Microschooling Center.
What is classified as a microschool can vary from “10 kids in a basement in Kentucky” to a 200-kid schoolhouse elsewhere.

Fiske said states need to create a way for operators and parents to know what to expect in a certain state, and help willing operators get the education and business acumen they need to run the schools successfully.
“But if you look at who is starting microschools in the U.S., it’s a lot of millennial parents who may not have any teacher training but wanted to create a learning environment for their children and others in the local community,” said Fiske. “And without efforts by the state to provide some incentives to earn accreditation and information as both a school and a small business, a few of these will find themselves going under.”
 Seeking choices

After two decades working in conventional schools in the United States and around the world — including in Brazil, Egypt and Qatar — Justine Wilson turned down a high-paying leadership role at a prestigious private school. Instead, in 2023 she opened Curious and Kind Education, a two-day-a-week microschool in Sarasota, Florida, built around trust, nature-based learning and self-directed play.
Enrollment at Curious and Kind is mostly driven by word of mouth, she said. The program now has a waitlist. And Wilson has seen her enrollment grow from 18 students in her first year to roughly 100 students for the upcoming school year.
“The number of 5-year-olds on my waitlist is shocking,” she said, “and then I realized they’re COVID babies and their parents have really been driving this search for alternative schooling since the pandemic.”
James, of the Center for American Progress, questions whether microschools generally match the quality of traditional public schools, which still educate more than 80% of schoolchildren. She says families may be under the assumption that school choice options equate to better quality.
“We have created an illusion of choice to be quality, and I think a lot of families are seeking various choice options because they associate that with quality. But that doesn’t necessarily mean that where those students are going is any better than where they left,” she said.
“We need to take a closer look at what we are presenting to families,” James said. “It’s not just about having options and having a choice. It’s about having quality choice options.”
That quality, Soifer said, is what microschools are trying to achieve.
“Microschools do very well on the left, on the right … at the top end of the economy and at the fragile end of the income spectrum,” he said. “It’s really a matter of the new economy and a new way of thinking about education.”

(Photo courtesy of VCU Capital News Service)State Democrats plan to make Indigenous People’s Day an official holiday in Virginia and will discuss the proposal in the next legislative session in January, a state delegate said over the weekend. The measure could face opposition from Republicans and others because it would mean replacing Columbus Day. 
Next session will mark the third straight year the idea has been proposed, after Democrats failed twice to bring the matter forward in committee hearings. 
On Saturday, Del. Rae Cousins, D-Richmond, announced she plans to introduce legislation in December to make Indigenous Peoples Day, which is widely observed in Virginia, an official holiday. The holiday would be observed on the second Monday in October, replacing Columbus Day, commemorating the 15th-century navigator and explorer Christopher Columbus.
While he was known for his exploration work, Columbus also paved the way for the colonization and decimation of Indigenous communities and his legacy has come under fresh scrutiny in recent years. 
“As we celebrate International Day of the World’s Indigenous Peoples, I am proud to be working alongside representatives from Virginia’s Indian tribes and indigenous advocates led by The Pocahontas Project to finally establish Indigenous Peoples’ Day as an official holiday in the Commonwealth,” Cousins said in a statement on Saturday. “I am committed to sharing more honest history, uplifting marginalized communities, and celebrating underrepresented stories, and this legislation is an important next step in that ongoing process.”
President Donald Trump and members of the Knights of Columbus have publicly stated they oppose Indigenous Peoples Day replacing Columbus Day. In April, Trump criticized Democrats for “destroying” Columbus’ legacy and committed to restoring the federal holiday named after him. 
Republicans and the National Italian American Foundation (NIAF) have also generally opposed public efforts to eliminate Columbus Day.
“As an organization devoted to the promotion and preservation of Italian American heritage, we support unequivocally maintaining Columbus Day’s status as a federal holiday,” NIAF said. “We believe that Christopher Columbus’ courageous voyage was the catalyst that initiated over 500 years of immigration to the Americas by people from every corner of the Earth— all of whom were seeking a better life for their families.”
A recent effort to replace the name failed in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
Last week, a Pennsylvania court overturned a Philadelphia mayor’s executive order to replace Columbus Day with Indigenous Peoples’ Day, stating he did not have the power to do so.
The Mercury reached out to Republican leaders in the statehouse for comment on the pending proposal but did not hear back by press time.
Cousins’ effort comes after Del. Paul Krizek, D-Fairfax, presented a similar proposal during the 2024 and 2025 sessions. She is partnering with The Pocahontas Project, a Richmond-based organization that leads the Indigenous Peoples’ Day Initiative, a national movement to inspire federal, state, and local governments to officially recognize the second Monday in October as Indigenous Peoples’ Day.
Democrats’ efforts to make Indigenous People’s Day an official holiday builds on work by former Gov. Ralph Northam, who proclaimed the second Monday in October as Indigenous Peoples’ Day in 2020, to recognize the histories and cultures of Indigenous people. Though the observance stands, it is not an official state holiday.
Connor Tupponce, vice chairperson of the Virginia Tribal Education Consortium (VTEC), said the proposal would honor his ancestors and the resilience of VTEC’s tribal cultures and communities.
“It presents an opportunity for all Virginians to come together in celebration of Indigenous Peoples as living, breathing, and evolving cultures, rather than figments of history, frozen in time,” Tupponce said in a statement. “This initiative further exemplifies the longstanding relationships between the commonwealth and Tribal Nations, as well as their commitment to uplifting the voices of Indigenous Peoples for generations to come.”
The proposal’s success will likely depend on the outcome of the gubernatorial race. Democrats are seeking to regain control of the governor’s mansion and hold their slim majority in the statehouse by electing Democratic nominee Abigail Spanberger, while Republicans want to maintain control of the executive office by electing Republican nominee Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle Sears.

(Photo by Shalina Chatlani/Stateline)NEW YORK — After a year in the U.S. Navy, Loceny Kamara said he was discharged in 2023, because while on base he had developed mental health issues, including severe anxiety and nightmares, and had fallen into alcoholism.
Kamara, 23, went to rehab and managed to get sober for some time while living with family in the Bronx, he said. But after he lost his job as a security guard in December, Kamara was kicked out of his home. Now he lives at a veterans homeless shelter in Long Island City, New York, and he relies on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as food stamps, and odd jobs to make ends meet.
Each month, nearly 42 million people receive SNAP benefits to help supplement their grocery budgets. Able-bodied SNAP recipients who are between 18 and 54 and don’t have children have always been required to work. Veterans, however, have been exempt from those rules — but that’s about to change.
The giant domestic policy measure that President Donald Trump signed on July 4 eliminates that exemption. Beginning in 2026, veterans will have to prove they are working, volunteering, participating in job training, or looking for work for at least 80 hours a month to keep their food stamps beyond three months, unless they qualify for another exemption, such as having certain disabilities.
Republicans in Congress and conservatives who helped formulate the law say these eligibility changes are necessary to stop people who could be working from abusing the system. But critics say the change fails to take into account the barriers many veterans face, and that the new work rules will cause thousands of veterans to go hungry.
“I’m pissed. I mean, I cannot get a job. Nowhere to live,” said Kamara. As he spoke, Kamara pointed to his collared shirt, noting that he had just dressed up to interview for a job as a security guard. He learned that morning he hadn’t gotten the job.
“I’ve been out of work for eight months,” Kamara told Stateline. “It’s hard to get a job right now for everybody.”

Veterans depend on SNAP
Nationally, around 1.2 million veterans with lower incomes, or about 8% of the total veteran population of 16.2 million, rely on food stamps for themselves and their families, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning research group.
An analysis by the group found veterans tend to have lower rates of employment because they are more likely to have health conditions, such as traumatic brain injuries, that make it difficult for them to work. They also tend to have less formal education, though many have specialized skills from their time in the military.
There has been a work requirement for most SNAP recipients since 1996. But Robert Rector, a senior research fellow at The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, said the rules have “never really been enforced.” Rector argued that able-bodied people who have been exempt from the work requirement, such as veterans and homeless people, create an unnecessary burden on the system if they are capable of working but don’t.
“Most of the people that are in this category live in households with other people that have incomes, and so there really isn’t a chronic food shortage here,” Rector said in an interview. “We have tens of thousands of free food banks that people can go to. So it’s just a requirement to nudge these people in the proper direction, and it should no longer go unenforced.”
More than 3 million people would lose SNAP benefits under GOP bill, nonpartisan report says

Darryl Chavis, 62, said that view ignores the difficulties that many veterans face. When Chavis left the U.S. Army at 21 after two years of service, he said, he was “severely depressed.”
“Nobody even came to help me,” said Chavis, who served as a watercraft operator, responsible for operating and maintaining tugboats, barges and other landing craft.
Chavis said he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, which has made it difficult for him to keep a job. He just moved back to New York from Virginia after leaving a relationship. He’s been at the housing shelter in Long Island City since January.
“What I’m trying to do is get settled in to, you know, stabilize into an apartment. I have the credentials to get a job. So it’s not like I’m not gonna look for a job. I have to work. I’m in transition, and the obstacles don’t make it easy,” Chavis said.
The new SNAP work rules apply to all able-bodied adults between 55 and 64 who don’t have dependents, and parents with children above the age of 14. Some groups, such as asylum-seekers and refugees, are no longer eligible for the program.
Barbara Guinn, commissioner of the New York State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, estimates that around 300,000 New Yorkers could lose SNAP benefits due to work requirements. Of those, around 22,000 are veterans, homeless or aging out of foster care, she said. Almost 3 million New Yorkers relied on SNAP as of March 2025.
Veterans in other states are in a similar situation. In California, an estimated 115,000 veterans receive SNAP benefits, according to a study by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The number is nearly 100,000 in Florida and Texas, and 49,000 in Georgia.
Between 2015 and 2019 about 11% of veterans between the ages of 18 and 64 lived in food insecure households, meaning they had limited or uncertain access to food, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees SNAP.
“We know that SNAP is the best way to help address hunger. It gets benefits directly to individuals,” Guinn said. “There are other ways that people can get assistance if they need it, through food banks or other charitable organizations, but we do not think that those organizations will have the capacity to pick up the needs.”
A greater burden on states
In addition to the work rule changes, the new law reduces federal funding for SNAP by about $186 billion through 2034 — a cut of roughly 20%, according to the Congressional Budget Office, an independent research arm of Congress. The federal government expects the new work requirements to reduce SNAP spending by $69 billion as people who don’t comply are dropped from the rolls.
SNAP has historically been funded by the federal government, with states picking up part of the cost of administering the program. Under the new law, states will have to cover between 5% and 15% of SNAP costs starting in fiscal year 2028, depending on how accurately they distribute benefits to people who are eligible for the program.










This has been a strategic agenda to dismantle SNAP and to blame states for doing so.


– Gina Plata-Nino, SNAP deputy director at the Food Research & Action Center


“This has been a strategic agenda to dismantle SNAP and to blame states for doing so, because they knew they are making it so incredibly burdensome to run and operate and unaffordable,” said Gina Plata-Nino, SNAP deputy director at the Food Research & Action Center, a poverty and hunger advocacy group.
“States are going to have to cut something, because there’s no surplus. There are no unlimited resources that states may have in order to be able to offset the harm.”
Guinn said New York expects to see a new cost burden of at least $1.4 billion each year. In California, new state costs could total as much as $3.7 billion annually, according to the California Department of Social Services.

Kaitlynne Yancy, director of membership programs at Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, said many veterans with disabilities will not be able to fulfill the work requirements or find resources elsewhere. And it’s unclear whether states will be able to provide their own relief to people who are no longer exempted from work requirements or will be excluded from the program.
“It is a frustrating thing to see, especially for those that have been willing to put everything on the line and sacrifice everything for this country if their country called them to do so,” she said.
Yancy, 35, served in the U.S. Navy from 2010 to 2014. She began to use food stamps and the Medicaid program, the public health insurance program for people with lower incomes, as she navigated life’s challenges. They included going back to school to pursue her bachelor’s degree, becoming a single mother, and a leukemia diagnosis for one of her children. Frequent trips to the hospital made it hard for her to work steadily or attend school for 20 hours each week, she said.
Guinn said the new rules will create significant administrative challenges, too; even SNAP recipients who are working will struggle to prove it.
“Maybe they’re working one month, they have a job, and then their employer cuts their hours the next month,” Guinn told Stateline. “There are mechanisms for people to upload documentation as needed to demonstrate compliance with the program, but from an administrative standpoint, right now, we don’t have any super-high-tech automated way of doing this.”

(Photo by Ethan DeWitt/New Hampshire Bulletin)A coalition of school districts, a teachers union, the vice president of the Manchester NAACP, and an LGBTQ+ advocacy group are suing the state over a new law that seeks to ban diversity, equity, and inclusion policies from schools and local governments. 
That law, which was added to the state’s two-year budget signed by Gov. Kelly Ayotte in June, seeks to strip out DEI programs from public schools, public universities, and government entities, and includes financial penalties for school districts that don’t comply.
Supporters of the law, passed as part of House Bill 2, say it will remove policies that are discriminatory and will require school districts and governments to treat people by merit and not identity.
But plaintiffs in the lawsuit — filed in the U.S. District Court of New Hampshire Thursday by the American Civil Liberties Union of New Hampshire, the National Education Association of New Hampshire, GLBTQ Legal Advocates and Defenders, and attorneys from Drummond Woodsum & MacMahon — say the law is vague and unconstitutional, and would prevent schools from providing an “inclusive education.”
“Given HB 2’s vague and far-reaching scope in the education context, enforcers undoubtedly will arbitrarily decide when HB 2 applies and when it does not,” the lawsuit contends. “To the extent enforcers believe that any of this conduct is exempt from HB 2, this merely underscores the vague, irrational, and incomprehensible parameters of the law.”
The Department of Justice is likely to file a motion responding to this month’s lawsuit in the coming weeks. “We will review the complaint and will respond as appropriate in court,” a spokesman, Michael Garrity, said in a statement Friday. 
The lawsuit echoes similar legal action in 2021 against the state’s so-called “divisive concepts law,” which barred public school teachers from advocating certain concepts about racial and gender disparities and oppression. That lawsuit led the U.S. District Court to strike down that law in May 2024, after the court agreed with plaintiffs that it was too vague for teachers to follow. The state has since appealed that decision to the 1st Circuit Court of Appeals, which heard oral arguments in April.
What the new law does
The language in HB 2 seeks to prevent any diversity, equity, and inclusion programs at the state and local governmental level. 
Under the new law, no public entity may “implement, promote, or otherwise engage in” any DEI-related programs, trainings, or policies. That includes implicit bias training, DEI assessments, critical race theory, or race-based hiring or promotion.
The law defines DEI as “any program, policy, training, or initiative that classifies individuals based on a characteristic identified under RSA 354-A:1 for the purpose of achieving demographic outcomes, rather than treating individuals equally under the law.” Those characteristics include age, sex, gender identity, race, creed, color, marital status, familial status, physical or mental disability, and national origin. 
In addition to school districts, the law applies to municipal government departments, offices, boards, and subdivisions. It also applies to vendors. Local government entities are required to review their existing contracts “for the presence of DEI-related provisions,” a process that will be overseen by the state’s Department of Justice. 
The law requires all public school districts to carry out a review of their vendor contracts by Sept. 30 and identify any DEI provisions, and it requires the Department of Education to monitor that review process and submit a report aggregating all school district contracts to the Legislature by Oct. 1. 
And the potential consequences for school districts are steep. 
“Should a public school fail to abide by any section of this subdivision, either knowingly or unknowingly, the commissioner of the department of education shall immediately halt all sources of public funding to that public school, until such time as the school comes into compliance with all sections of this subdivision,” the law states.
Debate over impact
For supporters of the new law, the anti-DEI prohibition is designed to make schools and state and local governments fairer to all. Rep. Jess Edwards, an Auburn Republican, likened DEI programs to affirmative action programs, and said eliminating them would require school districts to be more objective.
“Aren’t we supposed to be judged by the content of our character and not our skin?” Edwards said at a hearing in April in which the language was first added to the state budget.
But plaintiffs in this month’s lawsuit say the breadth of the DEI ban could affect programs the laws supporters do not intend to target.
For instance, plaintiffs argue, a school district could interpret the law to prevent them from creating sports teams specifically for girl; from making menstrual hygiene products available at no cost to female students; from teaching Holocaust classes that consider how intolerance and bigotry can be combatted; and from attempting to create greater access for Black and Latino students to comply with the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
And the law could entangle special education plans under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, plaintiffs allege, because school districts might interpret the ban to prevent them from treating people with a “physical or mental disability” differently. 
“These concepts are, at their core, about addressing the individualized needs of specific disabled people — namely, providing individualized services, accommodations, and supports that, by definition, are not provided to others,” the lawsuit states. 
Those outcomes are not guaranteed, but they are possible given the vagueness of the new law and the challenge for school districts to interpret how to comply with it, the plaintiffs argued, especially with the risk of severe financial penalties if they are deemed to be noncompliant.
The plaintiffs also note that the law does not affect just public school districts or public colleges and universities. According to letters sent by the state Department of Education and cited in the lawsuit, any private school receiving public education freedom account dollars could be subject to the law, as well as any private college.
Charges of vagueness were at the heart of the 2021 lawsuit against the state “divisive concepts” law. In that case, attorneys for the state argued that the law, and subsequent guidance from the state Department of Justice to teachers, was not overly vague and that the lines of what should be allowed or not allowed in a classroom were clear. 
In response to that lawsuit, some Republican state lawmakers proposed amending the “divisive concepts” law this year to clarify that it applies only when teachers “knowingly” teach concepts that are not allowed. Those bills, House Bill 50 and Senate Bill 100, both died after the House and Senate could not find agreement 
The 2025 anti-DEI law does not include that limitation: It applies to situations where school districts allow DEI programs to continue “either knowingly or unknowingly.”
Other free speech challenges
The latest federal lawsuit dovetails slightly with another filed by the National Education Association in March, also in the U.S. District Court of New Hampshire. That lawsuit challenges the U.S. Department of Education’s February “Dear Colleague” letter in which federal officials called on schools to eliminate DEI programs or face the denial of federal funding. 
That threat has been paused since April, when Judge Landya McCafferty issued a preliminary injunction against any enforcement of the letter.
Plaintiffs have shown irreparable harm,” McCafferty wrote in her preliminary injunction order.  “Plaintiffs’ members are presently suffering First Amendment violations as a result of defendants’ coercion of educational institutions into censoring their members’ speech.”
Meanwhile, schools and state officials are waiting for the appeals court in Boston to rule on the state’s appeal of the order striking down the “divisive concepts” law.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Full-New-Hampshire-House-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-12 05:56:47.530901

(Stock photo by Henry Redman/States Newsroom.)Buried in a March executive order from President Donald Trump is a provision that could cast doubt on voting machines in Ohio and around the country. The order directs federal officials to amend a set of security benchmarks for voting machines.
Those standards, known as the Voluntary Voting System Guidelines, are indeed voluntary. But some states, including Ohio, require compliance with the most recent guidelines in state statute.
“If that were to be implemented — if that executive order were to be implemented by the (Election Assistance Commission),” Lorain County Board of Elections Director Paul Adams explained, “it would basically decertify our equipment.”

The order
The president’s executive order drew a lot more attention for a different voting issue. Trump wanted to alter federal voter registration forms to require proof of citizenship. That move was quickly challenged and put on hold by the courts.
The guidelines updates would bar voting machines “in which a vote is contained within a barcode or quick-response code” unless it’s necessary to accommodate people with disabilities.
The order goes on to state ballots “should provide a voter-verifiable paper record.”
Adams explained that Lorain County, and several others, use machines that encode a voter’s choices so that the ballot can be quickly read by a machine. But even in those cases, there’s a paper trail to back up the votes. Election officials check that record in the post-election audit that happens after every single election.
“So, for the sake argument,” Adams explained, “if, for some reason, the bar code was off and it gave votes to somebody else for president or gave votes to somebody else for governor, you’re going to find that in the audit. You’re also going to find out in any recount.”
The reason is pretty simple: people don’t read barcodes.
“On a recount or an audit, you are looking at — not that barcode — you’re looking at actually what appears on the ballot that the voters saw when they cast their ballot.”
According to the Secretary of State, the majority of Ohio counties still use hand-marked paper ballots. But 28 counties, including Lorain, use a machine that prints out voters’ selections, and another 13 use a machine that directly records a person’s vote while producing a paper record.
The Ohio Capital Journal asked the Secretary of State’s office about the potential impact of the executive order. Secretary Frank LaRose did not respond.
So what happens next?
The first big question on Adams’ mind is dollars and cents. Think about the last time you went to vote. How many voting booths were there? How about ballot scanners? Now multiply that by hundreds of polling locations. All of that equipment is expensive, and Adams is quick to note no one at the state or federal level is offering to pick up the tab.
“So, this is going to be borne by local taxpayers,” he said. “It’s going to be boards of elections going to their county commissioners and saying, ‘I need to replace my voting equipment.’ And we’re talking millions of dollars.”
Nationwide, the cost could land in the billions.
Even before Trump’s executive order, the Election Assistance Commission was in the process of certifying machines for a recent update. The commission approved the first one just last month. Rachel Orey from the Bipartisan Policy Center said they’ve been studying what that transition might cost.
“Nationwide, it’s expected to cost probably, like $2-$5 billion to fully transition to this new type of voting equipment. Our current like, best guess is about $3 billion,” Orey explained.
Adams added that timing presents a challenge, as well. With less than 90 days until this November’s election, it would be very difficult if not impossible to overhaul the system in time.
The 2026 primaries might be a different story, but Adams warned if every jurisdiction in the country is looking for new equipment, “that waiting list is going to be forever.”
The risks
Even if the changes laid out in the executive order are relatively straightforward, applying them to a complex system likely won’t be.
Orey pointed out the executive order doesn’t technically ban equipment, and the new draft guidelines implementing the order seem to contradict themselves.
The order leaves the door open for bar and QR code machines for people with disabilities, and the guidelines gesture toward limiting their use to those voters.
But at the same time, the guidelines encourage election officials to get more people using accessible equipment to maintain ballot secrecy or to spot security and maintenance problems.
Orey worries that confusion could breed distrust. At first blush, the executive order appears to ban barcodes, and they’re even beginning to hear some election officials describing it that way.
“For me, the risk is really about that voter walking into the polling place and thinking that their ballot isn’t going to be counted because the ballot has a QR code on it,” they said. “And then that, you know, kind of spiraling out into distrust and conspiracy theories elsewhere.”
Adams has complete faith in his county’s encoded ballots, but he’s not opposed to a different approach.
“I can see how it could make people think and give a perception — even though I don’t agree with that perception — that there’s an issue.”
But he insisted county boards need adequate time and money.
“That’s what we have had every other time in the last 30 years when there is a required upgrade like this,” Adams said. “You take time, you make sure that there’s options, and you make sure there’s money. I’m okay with that. It’s just this moving this fast, I think it’s going to set election officials up for a disaster.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-12 09:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,CT insurers ask for bigger health plan rate increases: What to know,Jenna Carlesso,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/12/ct-health-insurance-rate-increases/,Insurers want to boost the cost of state-regulated individual health plans by 17.8% on average. Requests are considerably higher this year.,"Amid a storm of policy changes, new cuts to Medicaid, tighter restrictions on care at community health centers and expiring federal subsidies, Connecticut insurers want to boost the cost of state-regulated individual health plans by an average of 17.8% next year.
They have also asked for an average rate increase of 13.1% on small group policies. 
The requests are considerably higher this year. In 2024, insurance companies asked for an average rate hike of 8.3% on individual plans and 11.9% on small group.
The plans collectively cover about 224,000 residents (158,000 in individual policies and 66,000 in small group).
“The Affordable Care Act was created to increase access to affordable care. In 2025, a record 24 million people enrolled in ACA marketplace plans nationwide. The progress the ACA has made over the years is at risk,” Connecticut Insurance Commissioner Andrew Mais wrote in an op-ed earlier this month, pointing to federal subsidies that will lapse later this year and rising rate hike requests nationwide.
Attorney General William Tong called the rate increase requests unaffordable and pledged to scrutinize the proposals.
“I’ll be combing through every page of these applications and demanding that insurers justify every penny and every step they have taken to curb these out-of-control costs,” he said. “Year after year, insurers demand soaring rate hikes that far outstrip the pace of inflation and other cost growth benchmarks. They give us padded applications with vague references to trends they do not disclose or take any steps to control. … We need to hold them accountable and require better.”
Here’s what to know about the proposed rate hikes.
How much of an increase are insurers seeking?
Three insurers sell plans through the state’s exchange, known as Access Health CT: Anthem Health Plans, ConnectiCare Insurance Company and CTCare Benefits Inc.
Anthem asked for an average rate hike of 14.2% (increases range from 6.4% to 22.8% depending on the plan) for individual policies that cover 83,790 people.
ConnectiCare is seeking an average increase of 26.1% (rate hikes range from 5.9% to 28.6% depending on the plan) for individual policies that cover 3,685 residents.
And CTCare requested an average increase of 21.7 % (rate hikes range from 4.7% to 26.7%) for individual plans that cover 70,160 people.
Anthem is also seeking a 13.2% average hike for its small group plans that include 48,666 residents.
Additionally, insurers are asking for increases on off-exchange policies.
Does the state have to approve the increases?
No. The state’s insurance department can choose to approve the full requested increases, reject them or amend them. The final decisions will be published later this summer.
State officials must ensure the requests are not excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory. Actuaries will review the proposals, examining trends in unit cost (total expenditure incurred by the company), utilization of services and expected severity of claims.
Does the public have a say?
Yes. The public can weigh in on the proposed rate increases during a hearing on Aug. 18, from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. at Connecticut’s Legislative Office Building (Room 1A, 300 Capital Ave., Hartford).
Residents can also post comments online by clicking “select” under each rate request listed here.
Why are they asking for rate hikes?
Stephanie DuBois, a spokeswoman for Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield in Connecticut, said the higher rate hike request this year is due to more policyholders needing higher cost services, including emergency department visits.“Our submitted ACA rates are based on the health care services we expect members to access next year, along with the anticipated costs associated with that care,” she said. “Specifically, there has been an increase in ACA members utilizing higher-cost services, including emergency room care and behavioral health services, as well as some prescription drugs and specialty pharmacy. These rates also reflect our ability to deliver on behalf of consumers in Connecticut given the changes at the federal level.”
Officials with ConnectiCare did not respond to a request for comment.
In announcing the rate hike requests, leaders with the state insurance department noted that proposed increases generally stem from rising health care costs, including the price of prescription drugs and greater demand for medical services, among other changes.
What else is happening with plans on the exchange?
Decisions at the federal level will change the cost of many health plans on the state’s insurance exchange as early as this year.
Around 90% of Connecticut residents who purchase a plan on the exchange receive financial support to help cover the cost. At the end of 2025, one type of subsidy, known as “enhanced premium tax credits,” is set to expire. As a result, Connecticut residents with exchange plans could expect to pay $1,700 more on average every year for their health insurance, according to Access Health CT. Over 135,000 people will lose at least some financial support. A fifth of those people, or roughly 27,000, will no longer be eligible for any financial assistance.
The expiration of the enhanced subsidies will also deal a major blow to Covered Connecticut, a program that provides no-cost exchange plans to residents who make too much to qualify for Medicaid but still earn 175% or less than the federal poverty level. Covered Connecticut currently provides more than 40,000 residents with no-cost health and dental coverage. The Department of Social Services estimates it would cost the state $30 million annually to continue the program.

(Photo by Graham Stokes for Ohio Capital Journal. Republish photo only with original article.)Ohio Democrats are taking inspiration from Texas as they gear up for their own congressional redistricting battle.
Democrats across the nation are showing solidarity with Texas lawmakers, ones who fled their state to block a Republican-proposed congressional map from being passed — a map that redrew several seats currently held by Democrats to make them more favorable for the GOP.
“What starts in Texas is going to go on to the next state and the next state,” Ohio state Rep. Eric Synenberg, D-Beachwood, said.
Synenberg and several colleagues rallied outside the Massachusetts Statehouse with Texas and other states’ Democrats on Wednesday, since he believes that Ohio is the next state to take on this fight.
“They’re going to make the maps less fair, and therefore, an unproportionate and outsized number of Republican congressmen would have a better chance of winning their seats in 2026,” Synenberg said.
The congressional mapmaking process is set to begin soon in Ohio, with Republicans like Vice President JD Vance and state party leader Tony Schroeder hoping to expand the slim GOP majority in the U.S. House.
“The control of the House is incredibly important, and it all starts with the speaker,” Schroeder said. “Having a larger margin there makes life a lot easier in terms of getting legislation through.”
Ohio Republicans are eyeing three seats: Democratic U.S. Reps. Emilia Sykes of District 13 in Northeast Ohio, Marcy Kaptur of District 9 in Northwest Ohio, and Greg Landsman of District 1 in Southwest Ohio.
Although the state’s redistricting commission is controlled by GOP leaders, House Assistant Majority Floor Leader Adam Bird, R-New Richmond, said the national stage won’t play into Ohio’s mapmaking process.
“We’re not looking for any specific outcome,” Bird said. “We want to abide by the Ohio Constitution.”
Unlike the special session that was held to change the district lines in Texas, Ohio is required by law to redraw the congressional districts for 2026, since the 2022 map wasn’t agreed upon with bipartisan support.
Also, different from Texas, Ohio Democrats are unable to block a vote by fleeing the state and preventing a quorum.
Lawmakers get to draw maps first, but if there isn’t a bipartisan agreement, the Republican-controlled Ohio Redistricting Commission gets to do it.
State law already prevents Ohio from gerrymandering, Bird said, and said Ohio has a majority of GOP districts because, he claimed, the map is proportional to statewide election results.
Currently, there are 10 Republicans and 5 Democrats representing Ohio in the U.S. House. That’s 66% Republican.
“When you look at the margin by which Mike DeWine won and the margin by which Donald Trump has won Ohio the last couple of times, they’re significant,” Bird said.
President Donald Trump beat former Vice President Kamala Harris 55%-44% in 2024 in Ohio. With that result, Ohio’s 15 congressional districts would be 8 Republican and 7 Democratic.
But Ohio Republican U.S. Sen. Bernie Moreno said he believes Ohio should be 12-3. That would be 80% Republican.
That breakdown isn’t resonating with all GOP leaders, like Lt. Governor Jim Tressel.
We asked Tressel if that map make-up would be fair.
“Well, you know what? I can’t really join into that conversation,” Tressel responded. “If you would have asked me how many Republican, Democrat representatives we had, I wouldn’t have had the answer to it.”
Being lieutenant governor, Tressel was asked whether he thinks he should know the make-up of Ohio’s U.S. Congressional delegation.
“I suppose I should. If I had to take a quiz on it, you just quizzed me, and I just learned — that’s great,” Tressel said. “The only thing that’s fair is what the people vote for.”
Democrats say it’s encouraging that the Gov. Mike DeWine-Tressel administration says they want the voters’ voices to be heard.
“Even now with our 10-5, that’s not fair,” Synenberg said. “Anything on top of that would be, obviously, even worse and even less democratic.”
By law, state legislators must have a congressional map by the end of November.
Ohio House Speaker Matt Huffman said in June that initial district drafting would begin in August.

(Photo courtesy of Justine Wilson)When Siri Fiske founded the Mysa Microschool in Washington, D.C., in 2016, there wasn’t a widely accepted term for her small, one-room schoolhouse model.
Now, the school is referred to on its website as one of the first microschools in the nation, and Fiske has seen a growing microschool movement since the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the five years since remote schooling amid pandemic-era lockdowns, microschools and homeschooling have emerged as increasingly popular alternatives to traditional public and private models. Smaller class sizes, individualized classrooms, and lack of standardization are an appeal to parents, Fiske said.
“There’s this idea that people who open microschools are doing it for cultish or religious reasons, and there’s a misconception that all are like that,” Fiske said. “I’ve seen my students graduate into top colleges. There’s many ways to achieve academic success.”
Some education experts, however, have expressed concern about the growing movement. They question whether microschools are properly regulated and being held accountable, and whether they’ll pull dollars out of the public education system.
There is no federal definition of a microschool, and with the Trump administration’s plans to shutter the U.S. Department of Education, the onus is on states to figure them out.
In some states, microschools face a bind: If they operate as private schools, they’re required to meet facility, staffing, and curricular standards that are often cost-prohibitive for schools their size. If they operate under homeschool laws, they face oversight, assessment mandates, and reporting requirements that aren’t designed for multifamily or educator-led models.
Some states, including Georgia, Tennessee, and Texas, have passed “Learning Rights Protection Acts” to codify microschools’ right to operate.
In Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, and Oregon, learning pods and microschools often face child care or private school licensing requirements if they involve multiple families, hire instructors, or provide compensation for child care.
“Schools calling themselves microschools today are not what I would’ve called one back then. But I think that’s OK. It’s evolving,” Fiske said.
She pointed to the national school choice movement — and states such as West Virginia — for helping the microschool movement flourish.
In 2022, West Virginia became one of the few states to define a microschool, distinctly separating it from a private school, home school, or learning pod.
Those classifications, and how these schools are funded and regulated, affect everything from whether a school must hire certified teachers to how it ensures student safety or civil rights protections. And with more public dollars flowing to private or hybrid learning options through vouchers and education savings accounts — to the detriment of public school funding, some argue — states will need to define these schools and their place in the ecosystem.
States will have to fill the gaps, said Weadé James, senior director of K-12 education policy with the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning policy think tank.
“Accountability can vary wildly. Some microschools aren’t required to have certified teachers, conduct annual assessments, or even guarantee civil rights protections,” said James. “If public voucher dollars are going to a microschool, there has to be some level of oversight and accountability.”
Many microschools aren’t accredited
Microschools defy easy classification, and many advocates argue that’s by design. Don Soifer, CEO of the National Microschooling Center, an industry group, cautions lawmakers against rushing to impose fixed legal definitions.
“Innovation is happening too fast. The moment you define it in law, it becomes obsolete,” Soifer said.
A 2024 sector analysis by the National Microschooling Center — one of the only sources of national data on the topic — found that many schools are operating outside traditional education principles.
In a survey of 400 microschools across 41 states, more than 60% of founders reported they were not currently licensed educators. Eighty-four percent reported their schools were not accredited. Among prospective founders, 48% are licensed educators (though only 14% currently work in public schools), 32% come from non-education fields, and 23% are parents building schools for their own children.
Most microschools (55%) operate under home-school laws, while others function as private schools (37%), charters (6%), or fall into unique state categories (3%), according to the analysis.
“So, you can be a private or home-school microschool program, where you aren’t required to provide students with certified teachers, or you aren’t required to conduct annual assessments,” James said.
Often described as “home-school hybrids” or “small-scale learning communities,” microschools often serve around 16 students or fewer, and tend to cater to families with average or above-average incomes in their area. In some states, microschools have been authorized to receive public funds through voucher programs.
Some critics note that, like private schools, microschools may charge tuition, potentially excluding lower-income families and contributing to educational disparities.
These schools often operate in commercial spaces (41%), private residences (28%), or houses of worship (25%), according to the National Microschooling Center. The center also found the movement is diversifying: 37% of prospective founders are people of color, compared with 27% of current operators.
Because building and zoning codes vary from state to state and locality to locality, many operators may be unaware of the extra costs to meet school codes standards. Fiske recalls difficulties in expanding from Washington, D.C., to Vermont, which has stricter laws on water fountain requirements.
“Most people in the U.S. starting a microschool are doing it under the radar because the regulations to open a licensed school are so intense,” Fiske said. For the new school, she recalled, “it took us forever, and we had to install ADA-compliant toilets and water fountains for just 10 kids in Vermont.”
‘Microschooling is not one thing’
Microschools also operate in a legal gray zone, often outside the traditional K-12 system and subject to a patchwork of state and local policies that can either support or constrain their growth.
Growth has accelerated in conservative-leaning states with robust school choice programs, such as Arizona and Florida. Other states, such as Maryland, New York, and North Dakota, have more restrictive home-school or private school laws.
“Microschooling is not one thing. These schools look different in every state, and the policy frameworks around them vary wildly,” said Soifer, of the National Microschooling Center.
What is classified as a microschool can vary from “10 kids in a basement in Kentucky” to a 200-kid schoolhouse elsewhere.
Fiske said states need to create a way for operators and parents to know what to expect in a certain state, and help willing operators get the education and business acumen they need to run the schools successfully.
“But if you look at who is starting microschools in the U.S., it’s a lot of millennial parents who may not have any teacher training but wanted to create a learning environment for their children and others in the local community,” said Fiske. “And without efforts by the state to provide some incentives to earn accreditation and information as both a school and a small business, a few of these will find themselves going under.”
Seeking choices
After two decades working in conventional schools in the United States and around the world — including in Brazil, Egypt, and Qatar — Justine Wilson turned down a high-paying leadership role at a prestigious private school. Instead, in 2023 she opened Curious and Kind Education, a two-day-a-week microschool in Sarasota, Florida, built around trust, nature-based learning, and self-directed play.
Enrollment at Curious and Kind is mostly driven by word of mouth, she said. The program now has a waitlist. And Wilson has seen her enrollment grow from 18 students in her first year to roughly 100 students for the upcoming school year.
“The number of 5-year-olds on my waitlist is shocking,” she said, “and then I realized they’re COVID babies and their parents have really been driving this search for alternative schooling since the pandemic.”
James, of the Center for American Progress, questions whether microschools generally match the quality of traditional public schools, which still educate more than 80% of schoolchildren. She says families may be under the assumption that school choice options equate to better quality.
“We have created an illusion of choice to be quality, and I think a lot of families are seeking various choice options because they associate that with quality. But that doesn’t necessarily mean that where those students are going is any better than where they left,” she said.
“We need to take a closer look at what we are presenting to families,” James said. “It’s not just about having options and having a choice. It’s about having quality choice options.”
That quality, Soifer said, is what microschools are trying to achieve.
“Microschools do very well on the left, on the right … at the top end of the economy and at the fragile end of the income spectrum,” he said. “It’s really a matter of the new economy and a new way of thinking about education.”

(Stock photo by WEWS.)Ohio advocates have been approved to start collecting signatures to put a marriage equality amendment and an equal rights discrimination protections amendment on the ballot.
Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost certified two separate constitutional amendment proposals Friday: one would remove a provision from the state Constitution that prohibits same-sex marriage, and the other would prohibit discrimination by state and local governments because of race, sex, pregnancy status, sexual orientation, disability, or other attributes.
Ohio Equal Rights, which is running both amendment campaigns, was required to put forward two proposals instead of one that focused on all LGBTQ+ rights. Republicans on the Ohio Ballot Board said that the same-sex marriage issue was fundamentally different than the discrimination protections.
Ohio Ballot Board splits proposed Ohio Equal Rights Amendment into two amendments

In 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Obergefell v. Hodges that same-sex couples have the fundamental right to marry, but the Ohio Constitution has never been updated to reflect that.
This citizen-led proposal would repeal the provision saying that “only a union between one man and one woman may be a marriage valid in or recognized by this state and its political subdivisions.”
In 2022, Justice Clarence Thomas said that the Supreme Court of the United States should reconsider landmark cases such as Obergefell. This helped push forward this amendment, organizers said in July.
Because they already met with the ballot board in July, they were given the go-ahead by politicians that they wouldn’t need to return if it was split up as the board recommended, one of the Ohio Equal Rights team members said Friday.
The team did not say which ballot they are aiming for, but they will need to collect about 415,000 signatures for each amendment, they said.

(Photo by Getty Images)A group of Massachusetts lawmakers, officials and advocates are visiting Maine on Tuesday to learn more about how to prevent further contamination from so-called forever chemicals. 
Maine is regarded as a national leader for its work to implement policies that stymie the spread of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, also known as PFAS, which is a known carcinogen linked to an array of health issues. In addition to responding to high levels of PFAS in agricultural land from the historic spreading of sewage sludge, Maine was the first state to pass a rule requiring manufacturers to report intentionally added PFAS in products.
“Maine has led the way and we continue to lead the way,” said Rep. Bill Pluecker (I-Warren), who chairs the Legislature’s Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry Committee, who will be among the Maine lawmakers hosting the Bay State delegation.
Earlier this year, the Maine Legislature also worked on proposals to expand testing for contaminants in private wells and rid the state of PFAS-laden firefighting foam, which is another significant source of contamination. Some of those proposals won’t be finalized until the next legislative session, which starts in January. 
Some progress made this session as Maine’s waste challenges keep piling up

Similarly, Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey signed a law earlier this year to phase out the use of PFAS in protective gear for firefighters. The state’s Department of Environmental Protection also set PFAS drinking water standards in late 2020.
The Massachusetts delegation will start their day with a visit to a farm in Arundel that has been affected by PFAS contamination, followed by discussions with other farmers, advocates and Maine legislators in Augusta. The meeting was borne out of work between the Portland-based public health nonprofit Defend Our Health and a new national coalition called Sludge-Free Land, Pluecker said. 
Maine Sen. Henry Ingwersen (D-York) and Assistant House Majority Leader Lori Gramlich (D-Old Orchard Beach) will be joining Pluecker on Tuesday along with representatives from the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, as well as Defend Our Health and the Maine Organic Farmers and Gardeners Association.
While PFAS contamination is ubiquitous throughout the nation, the story in these two states is linked because the Vermont-based waste management company Casella imported sludge from Massachusetts and processed it in Maine before spreading it on agricultural fields as fertilizer, Pluecker explained. 
Adam Nordell, campaign manager with Defend Our Health, said Massachusetts’ sludge is still being brought into Maine to be composted, but because Maine banned the land application of sludge in 2022, it is now being sent back out of state. Maine was the first state to impose such a ban. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Nordell hopes the visit can spur a more regional discussion about addressing these toxic chemicals because “PFAS doesn’t necessarily respect property boundaries or state boundaries.”
Massachusetts Sen. Jo Comerford (D-Northampton) is currently sponsoring a bill that would ban the application of biosolids on land, as well as establish a fund to support farmers whose land has been affected or who would be impacted by increased fertilizer costs due to such a ban. The proposal also seeks to support municipalities in reducing sludge volume.
“Maine has led the nation in addressing and preventing further PFAS contamination on agricultural land while supporting impacted farms,” Comerford said. “I’m grateful to the legislators, agency officials, farmers, and advocates from both Maine and Massachusetts who will spend the day together learning about and discussing Maine’s approach and how we can embark on this work now in Massachusetts.”
Underscoring the importance of addressing contamination at its source, Pluecker said that more recent efforts in Maine to address PFAS in drinking water and private wells all trace back to sludge application.
Much of the progress made in Maine on PFAS stems from a task force, established by a 2019 executive order from Gov. Janet Mills, to determine the extent of forever chemical contamination in the state. It was also responsible for developing ways to protect Mainers from exposure to PFAS, which have been linked to serious long-term health problems including cancer, weakened immune systems, developmental issues, and more.










Maine has led the way and we continue to lead the way.


– Rep. Bill Pluecker (I-Warren)


Two years later, the state allocated $60 million dollars for the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry to develop a program to address agricultural land that was contaminated by the spread of sewage sludge. 
In May, Mills signed a bill to codify the programs supporting farms with high levels of PFAS into state law to ensure the support for farmers and remediation can continue.
According to the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, 90 Maine farms have been affected by PFAS chemicals to varying degrees through sludge application or other sources. 
Nordell lost his own farm to the toxic contamination, but he said most of those farms have been able to keep operating because the Legislature took action to support them. Maine’s success story shows that addressing PFAS contamination is “critically important and totally attainable,” he added. 
He hopes the delegation walks away from Tuesday’s visit feeling like “this is a problem they can afford to address.”
“If Maine can do that, then a state like Massachusetts can do it, too,” Nordell said.

(Getty Images)After one of the strongest earthquakes in recorded history grunted and shifted off the coast of Russia, geologists sent tsunami and aftershock warnings as far away as Hawaii and the North American mainland.
Thankfully, the July 29 earthquake, some 13 miles deep in the ocean and measuring 8.8 on the Richter scale, didn’t produce damage or injuries here in the U.S., though NBC News reported waves nearly 6 feet high slamming Maui.
Today on Kansas’ high plains, however, health care advocates warn of a figurative tsunami fueled by cruel Medicaid cuts that will shift tectonic plates beneath our hospitals, and it won’t stop there. The calamity will cascade in a variety of ways.
Medicaid advocates have said:

Births will become more dangerous because Medicaid covers nearly half of U.S. births.
Health care workers will lose their jobs.
Most hospitals will face short staffing.
Emergency rooms will see longer wait times.
Co-pays likely will increase.

David Jordan, president and CEO of United Methodist Health Ministry Fund along with REACH Healthcare Foundation, last month released a report from its partner organization Manatt Health, trying to forecast the impact of nearly $1 trillion in federal cuts.
Jordan told Kansas Reflector that the collected data were “clear and concerning.”
Twenty-nine Kansas hospitals are at immediate risk of closure and another 66 are at risk of closure, he said. Kansas Medicaid programs stand to lose $3.9 billion over 10 years and hospitals alone will lose $2.7 billion in Medicaid funding.
All of this in the name of “waste, fraud and abuse.” It’s reasonable to assume some waste, fraud or abuse, but not $1 trillion worth. 
“We will pay the price — higher costs, increases in local taxes, and less access to care — to offset these cuts,” Jordan said. “It’s critical that lawmakers, health care providers, advocates and the people of Kansas recognize the consequences before it’s too late.” 
Back in June, Brenda Sharpe, president and CEO at REACH, warned of dire consequences. 
“If this bill passes, it will cause long-lasting harm to thousands of families across Kansas and seriously threaten the survival of rural hospitals across the state,” Sharpe said on the REACH website. 
Manatt Health used computer models for its one-year and 10-year projections. Those findings were startling. 
For example, federal Medicaid cuts could lead to a 5% to 15% drop in enrollment, which could trigger a 22% drop in funding for state hospitals. This would increase the burden hospitals now face for uncompensated care. 
It will only worsen each year for the next 10 years, and that’s not the worst part. These aren’t just cuts. They will feel like amputations targeting the most vulnerable among us — children, seniors in need of long-term care and people with disabilities. 
“Kansans’ ability to access health coverage will be impacted by the changes to Medicaid and (Affordable Care Act) Marketplace eligibility and enrollment rules included in the ‘big, beautiful bill’ and by Congress’ failure to extend premium tax credits that make marketplace plans more affordable and led to a record enrollment of Kansans in ACA Marketplace plans last year,” Jordan said. “These changes would lead to an estimated 108,000 Kansans losing their Marketplace coverage will only increase uncompensated care, further challenging hospitals’ finances.” 
New eligibility restrictions, reduced benefits and new paperwork requirements certainly will mean that these vulnerable populations will end up losing coverage. Some 437,000 Kansans now rely on Medicaid. 
“We are trying to protect as many people as we can,” Sharpe said during a Zoom meeting with health care advocates. 
And after these cuts figuratively break people’s legs, they will be blamed for limping.  
A federal judge in July ruled that medical debt could remain on credit reports, canceling a policy of the previous administration to ease the burden of medical debt. This move will affect roughly a third of the nation.
“People who get sick shouldn’t have their financial future upended,” then-Consumer Financial Protection Bureau director Rohit Chopra under Biden told NPR. “The CFPB’s final rule will close a special carveout that has allowed debt collectors to abuse the credit reporting system to coerce people into paying debts that they may not even owe.”  
In January, the CFPB cited research saying medical debt wasn’t a good indicator of borrower fitness and shouldn’t be included in credit reports. These scores help determine a family’s ability to purchase a car or home. 
The bill also included $300 billion in cuts from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, otherwise known as SNAP. According to the National Institutes of Health, economic stress can lead to various forms of violence. 
Johnathan Sublet, the founder and executive director of SENT Topeka, a nonprofit organization aimed at strengthening neighborhoods, said, “a 1% increase in food insecurity could lead to a 12% increase in violent crime.” 
The cascade will continue into the next decade as windows of accessibility narrow.  
According to Neilsberg Research, roughly 16% of the population in Kansas is 65 or older, and 2% is 85 or older. 
This federal mandate will funnel these folks, along with children and the disabled, into a labyrinth of phone trees and websites, ironically in the name of government efficiency, but designed to discourage people from even applying.  
Medicaid cuts created the earthquake. 
And if you look toward the horizon, you can see a mammoth tidal wave beginning to crest.

Expect it to become the rallying cry of voters in Ohio, Texas, Indiana, Missouri, and Florida when they get wise to how their Republican overlords plan to dilute their votes and silence their voices—by preemptively stealing more gerrymandered congressional districts to keep the Republican majority in the U.S. House. 
Never mind that some Ohio votes will count more than others when state district maps are designed (again) to produce only Republican wins. 
The redistricting maps state GOP lawmakers redraw in 2025, to entrench Republican power in Congress, could well steal the crucial 2026 election before a single vote is cast. 
Ironically, the dirty dealer driving this brazen power grab to disenfranchise voters in Republican-led states is the same one who drove another disenfranchising scheme four years ago that culminated in a mob of Trump supporters violently storming the U.S. Capitol. 
Remember how they roared “Stop the Steal!” as they beat police, smashed windows, defecated in the U.S. Capitol rotunda, and threatened to hang the vice president after he refused to toss certified election results for his boss? 
Trump commanded them to “stop the steal” and “fight like hell” because “you don’t concede when there’s theft involved.” He played his followers for chumps to stay in office. 
Multiple investigations, audits and legal challenges found zero evidence to support his bogus claims about massive election fraud. Yet Trump still summoned the MAGA faithful to Washington and sicced them on lawmakers gathered to ensure the peaceful transfer of power and honor the will of the American people. 
The post-2020 election plot Trump directed to illegally overturn a free and fair election was shameless: False presidential elector slates in seven states. State legislators and state officials pressured to alter vote totals. Georgia’s secretary of state strong-armed (on tape) by Trump to “find 11,870 votes” in order to flip the state — after voters had spoken.
Fortunately, principled Republican leaders (and avowed Trump backers) from targeted states, e.g., Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, pushed back on Trump’s lawless campaign to corrupt the outcome of a legitimate election. 
Even under intense coercion from the Trump White House to subvert the choice of the electorate, (as a partisan favor) GOP stalwarts, including former Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers, refused to go along. 
“As a conservative Republican, I don’t like the results of the presidential election,” Bowers said in 2020, “but I cannot and will not entertain a suggestion that we violate current law to change the outcome of a certified election.” 
Back then, pro-Trump Republicans, like Bowers, were compelled to reject what Trump, and his co-conspirators, were peddling because it ran counter to the oath they took to the Constitution. 
Their allegiance to the rule of law prevailed over blind adherence to partisan subversion. They chose to protect the integrity of their elections rather than bow to the persistent harassment and intimidation tactics deployed by and for an unprincipled loser unwilling to accept the verdict of American voters.    
If only those Republican profiles in courage could be replicated today as Trump again tries to erase the voting power of ordinary citizens to decide who will represent them. 
He has mounted another pressure campaign on state GOP officials and legislators to redraw congressional maps in a brazen attempt to throw another election. This time, however, the felon-in-chief — whose attempted coup to stay in office (after his 2020 defeat) led to a horrifying insurrection against his own government — isn’t waiting until after the midterm elections to manipulate outcomes. 
He has targeted Republican-ruled states, including Ohio, to jigger the 2026 results in advance — 15 months before voters go to the polls. 
Trump, and his craven Ohio understudy JD Vance, are browbeating pliable state Republican lawmakers from Ohio to Florida to guarantee extra GOP seats in the U.S. House as insurance next November. 
Statehouse Trumpers who do as they’re told will fall in line, block all checks and balances on the Dear Leader and blunt Democratic congressional pickups in the off-year election by cheating now. 
It is unusual, though not unprecedented, for states to redraw voting boundaries in the middle of a decade when redistricting maps are normally done after each decennial census. But it is extremely unusual for the President of the United States to demand it of Republican-ruled states because he feels “entitled” to more Republican congressional districts with pre-selected voters who generate preordained election returns. 
Unlike 2020, there is no principled pushback from state Republicans. They are too fearful of crossing their king. 
Texas Republicans have the votes to satisfy Trump’s entitlement to a neutralized opposition with five newly gerrymandered districts. 
Florida Republicans hope to net a minimum of three new House seats from incumbent Democrats through arbitrary mid-decade redistricting. 
Missouri Republicans could add another Republican seat in Congress and Ohio Republicans are eyeing two or three more unconstitutionally gerrymandered congressional districts to appease Trump. 
They will rig the ground game to lock in absolute GOP control in districts that disenfranchise whole communities, that undermine voters’ ability to elect their preferred candidates. 
Call it grand theft politics to rob voters of their right to self-governance. From the same people who said, “Stop The Steal.”

(Photo by Eric Lee/Getty Images)Violent crime in the United States fell 4.5% in 2024, according to a new FBI report, while property crime dropped 8.1% from the previous year.
The declines continue a trend seen since crime surged during the COVID-19 pandemic, when homicides jumped nearly 30% in 2020 — one of the largest one-year increases since the FBI began keeping records in 1930. By 2022, violent crime had fallen close to pre-pandemic levels.
Homicides, which the FBI classifies as murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, dropped nearly 15% in 2024. Reports of other violent offenses also decreased, including rape by 5.2%, robbery by 8.9% and aggravated assault by 3%.
Property crime also fell across all major categories, with motor vehicle theft down 18.6%, burglary down 8.6% and larceny-theft down 5.5%. Reported hate crimes decreased 1.5% from the previous year.
Violent crime continues to drop across US cities, report shows

The 2024 report draws on submissions from 16,675 law enforcement agencies — 2.1% more than last year — representing more than 95% of the U.S. population. Every city agency serving a population of 1 million or more people provided a full year of data. Participation in the FBI’s crime data collection is voluntary, and the data is based on crimes reported to police.
About 75% of participating agencies submitted information through the FBI’s new, more detailed National Incident-Based Reporting System, or NIBRS, which covered 87% of the population.
The data release marks a shift from recent years when participation lagged following the FBI’s 2021 transition to the new system, which required many law enforcement agencies to invest in training and technology upgrades. In 2021, national reporting rates fell below 70% for the first time in two decades, forcing the FBI to estimate results for many jurisdictions.
The FBI’s crime trends report also includes new law enforcement safety data. Sixty-four officers were feloniously killed in the line of duty in 2024, 43 officers were accidentally killed and 85,730 officers were assaulted.
Although the FBI’s 2024 report is a year behind, it aligns with other crime trend reports. The Council on Criminal Justice, a nonpartisan think tank, recently found that homicides and other serious offenses, including gun assaults and carjackings, fell in the first half of 2025 across 42 major cities compared to the same period in 2024.

As has so often been the case with a legislature that refuses to work and negotiate in good faith, North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein had little choice last week but to sign the so-called mini-budget that state lawmakers approved a few days earlier.
With the new fiscal year already well-underway and numerous vital public programs and services in jeopardy, Stein understandably had no appetite for provoking a crisis by vetoing what he rightfully described as a “Band-Aid budget.”
All that said, the mini-budget bill is deeply and destructively flawed.
Among many other things: it fails to provide meaningful raises for teachers and state employees, fails to provide the minimum funding required to keep the state’s Medicaid program healthy, and fails to renew the hugely successful Healthy Opportunities Program that had slashed health expenditures and improved outcomes for low-income Medicaid enrollees.
The bottom line: The mini-budget is but the latest example of legislative leaders failing to fulfill their basic duties of governance. All North Carolinians should demand better.

Getty Images Georgia could soon take on an inspection role in ensuring grass-fed beef lives up to its labeling under a new proposal a key state legislator says he may pursue next year. 
State Rep.  Robert Dickey, who chairs the House Agriculture and Consumer Affairs Committee, said there needs to be more transparency in how cattle are raised in the grass-fed beef industry to protect consumers from potentially misleading marketing.
“We’ve got a great beef industry and healthy food, and that’s what consumers are looking for,” the Musella Republican said. “We just want to make sure that they are getting what they are paying for. We want to put parameters around what is grass-fed, corn-fed, pasture raised or organic.” 
The discussion comes as grass-fed beef has grown in popularity as health-conscious consumers increasingly seek fresher cuts of meat through farm-to-table programs that promise no preservatives, no hormone injections and no GMOs.
Dickey, who is a peach farmer, unveiled his idea back in April in the waning days of the 2025 legislative  session that saw a similar labeling bill targeting the shrimp industry gain traction in the House before dying in the Senate.
HB 117 mandated that restaurants verify on menus the source of shrimp as a means of transparency for consumers. If approved, its authors – including Reps. Jesse Petrea, Savannah Republican and Al Williams, a Midway Democrat – hoped it would also help the state’s beleaguered shrimp industry, which has struggled in recent years against foreign competitors with cheaper labor costs. 
The House passed the bill 165-7, but the measure failed to retain its momentum in the Senate. 
Dickey said he does not yet have details on the shape of the possible legislation, such as how “grass-fed” would be defined, what farmers would need to prove to qualify for certification or if there are costs associated with the inspections.
At this point, he wants input from consumers, beef producers and the cattle industry on what they would like to see in legislation if he were to make a formal proposal. The state Department of Agriculture could also play an advisory role if he finds the feedback persuades him to move forward.
“We want to make something that is workable for the ranchers and the cattlemen,” he said. “We don’t want to restrict, we want to make sure consumers understand what they are getting.” 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture used to regulate the labeling of grass-fed beef but stepped back from that role in 2016, University of Georgia professor of beef and cattle Lawton Stewart said. Third-party inspectors such as the American Grassfed Association, Food Alliance and A Greener World stepped in to fill the void.
The challenge the industry faces is defining grass-fed beef, Stewart said. Most cattle are raised eating grass but may be switched over to grain to fatten them up before processing. Others that are “grass-finished” can eat grain earlier in their lives but may be switched to an all-grass diet before they are processed.
“It comes down really to what tastes better to you, because grass-fed and grain-fed do taste different,” he said. “It comes down to the fat profile. The grass creates a different fatty acid profile compared to grain. And typically grass-fed is leaner because there are fewer calories in their diet.”
Dickey’s proposal received a mixed reaction from beef producers in the state. 
Will Harris, owner of White Oak Pastures in Bluffton, a leader in the grass-fed beef industry, said he’s all for transparency, but thinks the industry is already overwhelmed with labels. A better option would be to create more uniformity in how grass-fed beef is marketed and to ensure that beef raised in other countries is properly identified for consumers.
“Transparency is more than a label,” said Harris, who added that he invites consumers to see how cattle are raised on his farm in person. “We have an open-door policy.”
Fernando Mendez of Marview Farms in Arabi agreed. He said for the labeling to be effective, the public needs to be educated on the difference between grass-fed, grass-finished, grain-fed and other methods of raising cattle. 
“The way we talk about it is grass-fed, grass finished,” he said, adding that most people just hear grass-fed but aren’t aware there is more to it. “That’s a misinterpretation.”
Phillip Bridges, who operates Lexington-based The Georgia Beef Company with his brother Alan Bridges, said he opposes a state-mandated inspection. He already participates in the state’s Georgia Grown program, which works with farms to make sure their product is safe and trustworthy before giving a seal of approval. 
Adding another layer of inspection appears to him to be more government bureaucracy, he said. 
“If someone has a problem with my meat, they talk to me,” he said, adding that grass-fed producers lose customers if they are falsely identifying their product. “I’m not willing to do a third-party verification. I don’t see the need to pay someone to tell my customers I’m telling the truth.”
Georgia Agriculture Commissioner Tyler Harper said he will work with state leaders if this proposal becomes law in the future. Right now, the discussion is in its infancy, he said, and the road map is unclear. 
Legislation will have to balance the needs of the consumer and the producer and take into consideration production costs for farmers, Harper said.
“At the end of the day it’s about fairness to consumers and it’s about fairness to farmers and ensuring that the products are not deceptively labeled,” he said.

(Photo: Getty Images)Over the last 87 years – particularly during the 20th Century – few innovations in the American economy have done more to lift up average working people than the minimum wage.
As it was first conceived and applied, the federal minimum wage law sought to assure that a person who worked full-time was paid enough to support their family. And for many decades, the minimum wage actually worked that way for many people.
Unfortunately, in recent decades—thanks to opposition from corporate America and its allies on the political right—the federal minimum wage has long since ceased providing a living wage. Indeed, it’s now been more than 16 years since the minimum wage was raised to $7.25 per hour—a rate that was inadequate in 2009 and that is downright absurd in 2025.
But wait, it gets worse. If you’re someone who works for tips, the minimum wage (the so-called sub-minimum wage) is an astonishing $2.13 per hour.
Not surprisingly, as journalist Eyal Press reported in a recent New Yorker magazine article entitled “’No taxes on tips’ is an industry plant,” “the poverty rate among tipped workers is more than double the rate of other employees. Tipped workers are also more likely to rely on food stamps and other federal assistance.”
And while many states and cities have gone ahead and raised their minimum wages to much higher levels in recent years, in most others—including North Carolina—it’s still legal to pay the pitiful sums of $7.25 and $2.13 per hour. In case you don’t have a calculator handy, those wages would provide gross annual sub-poverty incomes for a full-time worker of $15,080 and $4,430.
All of which brings us to the latest conservative scam to keep the federal minimum wages at their current inadequate levels: the “no taxes on tips” law.
As you’ve probably heard by now, one of the provisions in the massive budget reconciliation bill passed by Republicans in Congress and signed into law by President Trump on July 4 alters federal law to mirror a gimmick floated by Trump during the 2024 campaign by exempting tips from federal income taxes.
North Carolina House Republicans proposed a similar provision in their version of a state budget earlier this year.
One must admit that it’s a superficially appealing idea. After all, the notion that a waitress scrambling to get by on tips and a legal wage $2.13 per hour would be required to pay income taxes is undeniably crazy.
But, of course, as is the case with so many proposals floated by Trump, a closer look reveals that there’s much less there than initially meets the eye.
As researchers at the Economic Policy Institute and North Carolina Budget and Tax Center have documented in a pair of recent briefs, the “no taxes on tips” idea benefits comparatively few workers.
Analysis from EPI shows that the law will benefit between 2.5 and 5.2 million tipped workers who will receive an income tax deduction before the policy expires in 2028. The average tax benefit would amount to $1,700 annually during the four years the bill would be in effect. Notably, however, the policy would disproportionately benefit the top 20 percent of all tipped workers, who would receive an average tax cut of over $5,700. Because so many tipped workers have incomes too low to have any federal income tax liability, the bottom 20 percent of all tipped workers would receive an annual average tax cut of just $74.
Meanwhile, the BTC reports that the North Carolina House proposal would provide tipped workers with a maximum annual tax savings of just under $200.
In contrast, a bill introduced in Congress earlier this year to incrementally raise the federal minimum wage to $17 per hour by 2030 while doing away with the sub-minimum wage (“The Raise the Wage Act”) would benefit nearly 23 million workers (or about 15% of the workforce) with an average annual boost in wages of $3,200. All told, workers would realize a $70 billion gain in wages.
Industry lobbyists—particularly for the restaurant industry—claim of course that such a change will lead to economic Armageddon, but as economist Michael Reich told the New Yorker’s Press, experience in jurisdictions that have already raised the minimum wage shows that that’s just not the case. Yes, a higher minimum wage will cause restaurant prices to rise to a degree and employment in the industry may decline slightly, but overall, workers will be much better off.
And more to the point, as Sally Hodges Copple of the BTC told me in a recent interview, the vast majority of struggling low-income workers in desperate need of a raise (e.g. child care workers, retail workers) do not receive tips.
In short, the answer to what plagues low-income workers in our country—whether they work for tips or not—is to once again make the minimum wage a living wage. The decision of conservative law and policy makers to promote a low-impact scheme like “no taxes on tips” is just the latest in an endless line of scams designed to distract from what really matters, and ultimately, to keep wages for working people unjustly low.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Getty_tax-tips-1024x687.jpg,,,2025-08-12 04:56:22.387667

(File photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters).State officials will get an updated look at Maryland’s revenue picture in a month, but the leader of the Maryland Senate expressed confidence Monday that the state is prepared — at least in the near term – to weather the as-yet-unrealized fallout of ongoing federal budget actions.
Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) said delays in implementation of recently passed federal budget cuts and employee reductions, and ongoing court challenges to policies implemented by President Donald Trump (R) will have some negative effect on the current budget year.
“We’re expecting to see negative numbers as compared to year over year, but we had built those into our projections,” Ferguson told reporters Monday.
The comments came after a 70-minute briefing for the Joint Federal Action Oversight Committee that Ferguson co-chairs with House Speaker Adrienne Jones (D-Baltimore County). The two appointed the joint committee this spring, after a legislative session where lawmakers crafted a fiscal 2026 budget that closed a projected $3.3 billion deficit by cobbling together shifts of funds from dedicated sources, sales and income tax increases, and some modest budget cuts.
They appointed the committee amid worries about how Trump’s slashing of federal aid, agencies and employment would affect Maryland. At the time, a return by lawmakers to Annapolis to deal with a worsening budget situation, possibly as early as September, was seen as likely.
But the effects of many of the cuts in Republicans’ One, Big Beautiful Bill, including billions in cuts to Medicaid, have been delayed until after the 2026 election. Also delayed, for now, are the expected impacts of federal workforce reductions and cuts to other federal aid and grants.
Federal job losses jumped to 12,700 in Maryland, most of any state

“Now my expectation is that that does not last forever, and that eventually those court cases and grievance policy protocols will end and those terminations will move forward,” Ferguson said of federal job cuts put in motion by Trump. “But that’s not where we are right now, and so, you know, we have to watch all of this with kind of an eye towards a cautious future.”
Some of that cautious optimism clings to the hope that budget projections made earlier this year will hold for now.
“My expectation is that we will see some level of alignment with our expectation of where we thought we would be,” Ferguson said.
But he and others continue to be concerned about the long-term impact federal budget changes will have on the state’s economy and budget priorities.
Federal jobs make up roughly 6% of all jobs in the state. One of every $10 in wages in the state is tied to $150 billion in annual federal spending, according to a briefing by the Office of the Comptroller.
“Here in Maryland, losses at the federal level are adding up … really threatening our middle class,” Comptroller Brooke Lierman told the joint panel Monday.
In June, the state recorded a loss of 8,500 jobs. More than 40% of those were in the federal government.
Lierman said the decrease represents “the largest single-month drop in federal government positions in Maryland in three decades.” Additionally, she said the 13,000 federal jobs lost since January has surpassed the number of jobs lost during federal sequestration.
“Maryland is really under economic assault from Washington, and the numbers are really staggering, whether it’s the budget reconciliation bill, tariffs or more, there’s so much happening every day,” Lierman said. “But the first step is really to quantify how these various changes will impact Maryland’s economy.”
The comptroller’s office is in the process of examining how more than 100 provisions in Trump’s tax-cut bill will affect the state. That report is expected in early September prior to the updated revenue estimates.
Also unknown, for now, are the ancillary impacts of federal cuts.
“How is that going to affect, you know, the food services industry and indirect economic impacts,” said Deputy Comptroller Ben Siegel. “Obviously we know those are very real as well.”

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)Although the odds indicate regulators will OK the first black bear hunt in a decade in Florida, opponents will pull out all the rhetorical stops when the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) gathers this week in North Florida for a final vote.
FWC commissioners voted 4-1 in May to give preliminary approval to a 23-day bear hunt, tentatively proposed for December, plus annual hunts from October through December beginning in 2026.
The bear population in Florida is estimated at around 4,050 — but the agency came up with that estimate as long ago as 2015, the last time a bear hunt took place. That hunt was shut down at the end of just its second day after nearly 300 bears had been killed.
Those bears are spread out across the state in seven areas known as Bear Management Units (BMUs) by the FWC.  In justifying the hunt, the FWC has said that, since 2015, the four largest subpopulations of bears have grown annually and no subpopulations have shown evidence of decline.
The plan as approved in May is to remove 187 bears from four “bear hunting zones” — 68 in the East Panhandle; 46 in the North; 18 in Central Florida; and 55 in the South hunting area.
As of now, permits would be issued through a random drawing and cost $100 for a Florida resident and $300 for those from out of state. The applications for those permits would cost $5.
Under plan approved by FWC Commissioners in May, hunters could use dogs to assist them and take bears at game feeding stations, using food to bait the animals.
Responsible or not?
Maria Davidson is large-carnivore program manager for the Safari Club International Foundation. She says the plan as conceived by the FWC is  responsible.
“The number of tags being issued in Florida is at a level that doesn’t even stop the population growth. It has the intent of slowing the population growth with wildlife populations similar to trying to navigate large-scale changes in direction,” she said while speaking with this reporter on WMNF 88.5 FM in Tampa on Friday.
“Bear populations don’t really self-regulate. Bears will take advantage of any food sources available, whether it be human-caused or not, and they will continue to grow in their core areas and just spill into unsuitable habitat,” Davidson continued.
“So, in order to slow that, you slow the population growth, which is exactly what FWC has done, and it was the recommendations from the biologists within the FWC to do that.”
James Scott serves on the executive committee of the Suncoast Sierra Club. He says the FWC has actually created “a bait and switch” in their proposal. Once finalized, the agency would allow more individuals to hunt and kill bears than those who participate through the lottery. 
A close look  in the FWC’s proposed hunt rules issued in May reveals language that, starting on Jan. 1, 2026, the FWC would create a “Private Lands Bear Harvest Program” that would permit landowners to hunt bear on their properties. 
The FWC would furnish one bear harvest tag for a property between 5,000 and 15,000 acres with at least up to five individual bears on the land; up to two bear tags for properties of between 15,000 and 25,000 acres with at least 10 bears; and a maximum of three tags for properties of more than 25,000 acres with at least 15 bears. The season would run from Oct. 1 through Dec. 31.
“Mark my words, if these rules pass as written, if they don’t cap or eliminate that program over time, that private-lands program will be the name of the game, and if you’re a hunter that wants to kill a bear in Florida, you’re going to have to go to a private landowner and fork over thousands of dollars to engage in a luxury bear-killing experience,” Scott said.
Davidson argues that’s not that big of a problem.
“The fact that FWC is choosing a mechanism that allows private landowners to benefit from the wildlife that they support out of their own pocket, to me, is not a negative thing, it’s just an additional opportunity or an alternative opportunity,” she said.
Public opinion doesn’t support a hunt

Public opinion polls show that Floridians don’t support a bear hunt. 
In a survey conducted by the FWC of more than 13,000 self-selected participants, 75% opposed the proposal, with just 23% in support. Other polls, such as a Remington Research survey commissioned by the Humane World for Animals, showed that 81% of Florida residents oppose the reopening of bear-hunting season.
On Saturday, protests against a bear hunt took place across the state,  all organized by the group Bear Defenders.
In Tampa, about a dozen people gathered at 10 a.m. on Saturday in the city’s Westshore area. Heidi Henson, a resident of Largo, said she was disappointed the public’s disdain for such an event doesn’t appear to be registering with FWC commissioners.
“I would say that you should really try to represent the people of this state and their viewpoints and that the majority of people believe that the hunts are cruel and unnecessary,” she said when asked what she would say to a commissioner if she had the opportunity.
“There are issues with bears encroaching on human habitation, [but] there are better ways of dealing with it other than a hunt. Trophy hunting is not okay.”
Isabelle Tassi with Bear Defenders said she wants people to call FWC commissioners and Gov. Ron DeSantis and tell them there’s no reason for a bear hunt. She condemned the equipment and tactics that FWC commissioners have already approved if there is a hunt.
“They want to use baiting, they want to use dogs, and they want to use bows and arrows, which are extraordinarily cruel, and there’s simply no reason for that. We need to leave the bears alone and not kill them and not use those horrific methods on them.”
Of the 40 states with black bear populations, 34 have regulated bear hunting seasons, according to the FWC.
The vote on whether the hunt will take place is scheduled for the FWC’s next quarterly meeting to be held on Wednesday and Thursday in Havana, in Gadsden County. If it is approved, the hunt will last three weeks, between Dec. 6 and Dec. 28.

Ned Lamont will be tempted to move funds from the hard-won opioid settlements to fill the gaps. This temptation should be resisted.,"Since the start of Donald Trump’s second presidency, we have been bombarded with news of reductions in federal funding for programs that provide critical services to Connecticut residents. These include cuts to disaster response, Medicaid, libraries, job programs, and more.
As the federal government pulls back funding, the General Assembly and Gov. Ned Lamont will be tempted to move funds from the hard-won opioid settlements to fill the gaps. This temptation should be resisted. The opioid crisis is ongoing and devastating.
Over the last decade, Connecticut has averaged over 1,000 overdose deaths a year. Treatment of opioid addiction and harm reduction are proven interventions that can reduce overdose deaths, yet only one in five receive evidence-based care. Behind these numbers are lives lost, families broken, and communities left struggling. Today, many of these patients still face barriers to care. These barriers will increase with the actions of the Trump administration and Congress to decrease funding for Medicaid and addiction services.
Connecticut will receive $720 million dollars from settlements prosecuted by Attorney General William Tong against drug companies, distributors, and retail pharmacies. These settlements are meant to serve a clear purpose: reduce opioid-related deaths and invest in prevention, treatment, and substance use recovery. The explicit goal is to address the continuing harms from an earlier era of opioid overprescribing and support people suffering from addiction and their families.
To guide use of the funds, the state established by statute an Opioid Settlement Advisory Committee. As a group of addiction physicians and researchers, and by invitation of the Committee, we generated a report summarizing the best evidence on efficacious interventions to address the harms of opioid use. To date the Committee has funded increases in harm reduction services, a statewide naloxone saturation plan, mobile treatment vans, recovery housing, and other interventions. Early signs show these efforts are making a difference. In 2024, Connecticut saw a decline in overdose deaths. This is a hopeful sign, but only the beginning, as every day we still lose, on average, three to four people to opioids. Now, this budding progress is in jeopardy.
Guardrails were built into the settlements negotiated by Attorney General Tong, and enshrined in state law, to avoid a replay of the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement, which brought more than $2 billion to the state. Only 10% of those funds went to anti-smoking efforts, while Connecticut lawmakers siphoned the rest away to non-tobacco related services to balance the state budget. Today, while tobacco still kills 4,900 people annually in Connecticut, the state spends none of its tobacco funds on tobacco control. The change in federal funding puts us in danger of repeating the same mistake with the opioid settlements.
This threat is not abstract. During the last budget negotiation Governor Lamont proposed dipping into the opioid settlement to circumvent the Opioid Settlement Advisory Committee. While Lamont’s proposal was ultimately unsuccessful, similar efforts to supplant funds by lawmakers in New Jersey successfully diverted $45 million dollars  into state hospital systems for services unrelated to addressing the opioid crisis. Nationally recognized guidance on the appropriate and ethical use of opioid settlement funds expressly recommends the prohibition of supplantation.  Furthermore, supplantation undermines settlement terms which specifically call for their use to remediate the harms of opioid use and threatens to erode public trust.
To be sure, federal funding decisions will force hard decisions in our state on how to fund crucial services, but the opioid settlements were never meant to be a pressure relief valve for the state budget when general fund deficits arise. These settlements are a form of justice. It is through investing in harm reduction and addiction treatment that lives will be saved and a stronger public health system built. The stakes could not be higher. The opioid crisis is not over. As the drug supply continues to evolve and overdoses remain a leading cause of death, politics cannot be allowed to interfere with progress. The opioid settlement funds should be utilized for the purpose they were created: helping the people who were harmed by the opioid crisis.
Today, Connecticut has a second chance at correctly utilizing settlement funds. This is not a moment for business as usual. It is a test on whether the state has learned from the past or whether it is willing to allow history to repeat itself.

While these actions are often framed as a political move against green energy, they are creating a storm of economic uncertainty and sparking legal battles that could define the future of clean power in the United States.  This issue is less about politics and more about fiscal prudence, energy security, and job creation. 

William Sweet
Federal policies on wind energy are creating significant uncertainty, and the effects are rippling all the way to Connecticut.  While the conversation often becomes polarized, a closer look at the economic realities reveals a compelling case for a collaborative, pragmatic approach that benefits communities, businesses, and taxpayers alike.
The decision by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management to rescind all designated wind energy areas for “speculative wind development” is not just a distant federal policy — it is an immediate threat to Connecticut’s clean energy goals.  
The state has made significant commitments to a zero-carbon electricity supply by 2040, a goal that relies heavily on a diversified energy portfolio.  Instead of presenting wind as a replacement for other energy sources, it is a key component of an “all-of-the-above” energy solution that enhances energy independence and grid reliability.  With the cancellation of future lease sales off the coasts of states like New York and in the central Atlantic, the entire development pipeline for the Northeast is at risk.
The potential benefits of offshore wind for Connecticut are substantial and multifaceted.  From an economic standpoint, the industry is poised to be a powerful engine for growth.  The state has already made strategic investments, most notably the $310 million upgrade to the New London State Pier Terminal, transforming it into a vital East Coast hub for staging and assembly of wind turbines.  This investment has yielded immediate results, creating many local union jobs and laying the groundwork for a robust supply chain.  A recent study by the Connecticut Wind Collaborative found that more than 50 Connecticut companies are already participating in active offshore wind projects, with another 450 companies having the potential to join this expanding sector.  This translates into job stability and a skilled workforce prepared for the energy challenges of tomorrow.
Beyond jobs and direct investment, offshore wind offers a solution to the state’s high and volatile electricity costs.  Unlike natural gas, which is susceptible to price spikes, wind has no fuel costs.  This allows wind power to be bid into the wholesale electricity market at a near-zero price, creating a “price suppression” effect that can lower the market price for all electricity generators.  A study by Synapse Energy Economics estimates that procuring 9,000 megawatts of offshore wind by 2030 could reduce electricity bills for New England customers by as much as $1.7 billion annually under high gas price scenarios.  For the average Connecticut household, this could mean an annual decrease in electricity bills of approximately $108 to $139.
From an environmental and public health perspective, the benefits are equally compelling.  Offshore wind produces virtually no climate pollution during operation, a stark contrast to the state’s continued reliance on fossil fuels.  Achieving the tri-state 9 GW offshore wind goal would cut 42% of annual CO2 emissions from the New England power sector and provide an estimated $362 million in annual public health benefits by reducing harmful emissions that contribute to respiratory conditions like asthma.
The stakes for Connecticut are high.  The state has already seen the tangible benefits of offshore wind with the opening of the South Fork wind farm, the nation’s first commercial-scale offshore wind farm, a project that demonstrates the potential for local job creation and a transition to a cleaner economy.  
The administration’s latest actions and those of Congress threaten to stall or cancel these kinds of projects, putting future jobs in the wind-energy sector at risk and potentially leading to higher electricity rates as the state is forced to rely on more volatile and expensive energy sources.  
In response, Connecticut’s Attorney General William Tong has joined a lawsuit with 16 other states and the District of Columbia to challenge the administration’s executive order, arguing it is a harmful and illegal obstruction of progress.  This lawsuit is not just a political protest, but a matter of fiscal prudence — a prudent defense of the state’s economic investments and future tax revenue, helping to restore the leasing and permitting processes, allowing developers to move forward with projects that have been in the works for years.
According to a project tracker at Cleanview, wind developers have planned 790 projects totaling 213 GW of power capacity, representing $317 billion in potential investment.  Interestingly, the economic fallout from these actions would be disproportionately felt in Republican-led states such as Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, and Iowa, which are major hubs for wind energy.  This creates a compelling narrative where a policy aimed at a political opponent’s “green” agenda is now threatening a significant economic blow to states that are key to the administration’s support. 
 Ultimately, a diverse domestic energy supply, including wind, is a matter of national security, as it reduces reliance on volatile foreign energy sources.

Wes Moore (D) as the difference between those who say they approve of the job the first-term executive is doing and those who disapprove continues to shrink. (File photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)Troubling poll news continues for Gov. Wes Moore (D) in a new survey that shows approval numbers for the first-term executive continue to slip and the gap between those who approve and disapprove of his performance continues to shrink.
The Maryland Now poll is the most recent of several over the last nine months that have shown a continued softening of support for the charismatic first-term governor.
Five in 10 surveyed in the latest poll said they approved of the job done by Moore. But the gap between those who approve and disapprove of the governor’s performance narrowed to 8 percentage points — a drop of 13 percentage points in six months.
The poll — conducted by Blended Public Affairs and powerhouse Annapolis lobbying firm Perry Jacobson — surveyed 1,256 Maryland residents by text message between July 24 and July 30. The poll has a margin of error of 2.7 percentage points.
The poll said 21% of those surveyed said Moore was doing an excellent job, down from 27% in February. Those who described Moore’s job performance as “not so good” remained statistically flat at 13% but those who rated Moore’s job performance as “poor” grew from 21% in February to 29% in the current poll.
The Maryland Now poll is the third this year to show the gap between approval and disapproval narrowing.
Moore fared better in the survey than President Donald Trump (R) and Maryland General Assembly Democrats and Republicans.
Trump, who lost Maryland in the 2024 election, remains unpopular in the state where registered Democrats outnumber Republican voters by a roughly 2-1 margin: Just 33% said they approve of the job Trump is doing.

	But Democrats, the supermajority in the Maryland House and Senate, are also unpopular. Nearly four respondents in 10 said they disapproved of the job done by Democratic state lawmakers as a group. Just about 30% approved of the job done by Republican lawmakers in Annapolis.
Since the end of legislative session, Moore has been the subject of a series of ads attempting to improve his image. Those ads are paid for by a group tied to the Democratic Governors Association. Last month, the association heavily promoted a poll conducted by Morning Consult that claimed Moore was one of the 10 most popular governors in the country, with a 31 percentage point gap between his approval and disapproval numbers.
But those figures bucked the trend of polls taken by traditional pollsters earlier this year.
Moore. a charismatic leader with no political record, entered office in January 2023. In May 2023, he boasted a 53% approval number in a survey released by the Sarah T. Hughes Center for Politics at Goucher College. Notable in that poll was the 27-percentage point difference between those who approved of Moore’s performance and those who did not.
The last year for Moore has been more difficult.
In March, Moore maintained a 55% job approval rating in a poll released by Annapolis-based Gonzales Research & Media. In that survey, the difference between those approving of Moore’s performance and those who did not approve fell to 19 percentage points compared to a poll conducted two months earlier.
Moore had a similar showing in a February poll by the Institute of Politics at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. In that survey, the governor maintained a 52% job approval number but the difference in his approval and disapproval numbers shrank to 12 percentage points. Three months earlier, the same poll gave Moore a 22-percentage point cushion.
The 2025 session was the most challenging so far for Moore who faced a $3.3 billion structural budget deficit.
The poll released Monday found voters are generally pessimistic. Roughly two-thirds of those surveyed said the country is on the wrong track. Fifty-four percent have a negative view of Maryland’s economy and 67% said the amount of taxes paid in Maryland is “too high.”
Even so, 59% of voters in the poll appear to lay more of the blame on Trump and Republicans in Congress. One in four blamed Moore.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/DSC_0377-newsletter-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-08-11 23:56:37.133895

Tyler Dees (R-Siloam Springs) asks a question during a meeting on Grant Hardin's escape from the North Central Unit, taken on Aug. 11, 2025. (Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)An automated inmate classification system incorrectly identified a former police chief and convicted murderer as a medium-risk prisoner for “five to six” years, Arkansas Division of Correction Director Dexter Payne told a legislative panel Monday.
Grant Hardin — a convicted rapist and murderer who was previously a state prison guard and small-town police chief — should have been given a high-risk classification but was not, Payne told the Arkansas Legislative Council’s Charitable, Penal and Correctional Institutions subcommittee.
Hardin, 56, escaped on May 25 from the North Central Unit at Calico Rock. Hardin should have been held in a higher security facility, Payne said. He was transferred to the Varner SuperMax Unit near Gould after his capture on June 6.
“Without an override, he should not have been there” at Calico Rock, Payne said.
Other corrections officials told lawmakers at a previous committee hearing that the North Central Unit housed both some serious felons as well as medium-risk inmates.
Lawmakers challenge Arkansas prison officials over escape of convicted murderer-rapist

Payne said the division’s classification office is supposed to review inmate classifications “at least yearly” to ensure that the system’s risk assessments are accurate.
“The system calculates the score,” Payne said. In order for a prisoner with a score that marked them as a high-security prisoner to stay at a medium security prison like Calico Rock, “the warden, the deputy director or myself would have to override that to keep him there.”
Hardin escaped from Calico Rock while working in the prison kitchen. A kitchen manager allowed him to go to the kitchen’s loading dock unsupervised, a violation of prison policy. Using a marker, Hardin dyed a white prison uniform black to make it look like a guard’s uniform. A tower guard allowed Hardin to walk out of the prison’s back gate without verifying his identity.
His escape prompted a manhunt by local, state and federal law enforcement. Searchers found him hiding in dense woods less than two miles from the prison.
Corrections officials fired the kitchen manager and the guard immediately after the escape, Payne said. He told lawmakers Monday that he stood by those dismissals. Other employees have been suspended or demoted in connection with lapses that led to Hardin’s escape, he said.
Payne said more searches of the back dock and the outdoor areas of the prison would be conducted going forward. The correction division also changed their procedure for opening gates to prevent a similar mistake from happening in the future, he said.
“I think that’s where we failed at this point, at this facility. The back dock area was not searched enough, or they would have probably found that [Hardin] was hiding items out there,” Payne said.


Let us know what you think...


 

Subcommittee co-chair Rep. Howard Beaty, Jr., R-Crossett criticized Payne and department staff for not taking more responsibility for the prison break.
“When there’s a breakdown or a failure of my employees to execute the instructions and the plans that I have given, some of that responsibility falls on me,” Beaty said.
“I’m the person that’s in front of you today because I am overall responsible,” Payne responded.
When Rep. Justin Gonzales, R-Okolona, asked if someone within the department entered something incorrectly into the system to prompt the inaccurate classification, Payne said they still weren’t sure.
“We don’t know yet how it didn’t calculate the score correctly,” he said.
He said they expected to discover that more inmates were incorrectly classified.
Sen. Ben Gilmore, R-Crossett, was unsatisfied with the remaining unanswered questions about how Hardin escaped in his evaluation of the incident.
“Two things can be true. And those two things are, yeah, people didn’t do their job, but also there should be checks and balances to ensure that people do their job. Where are those checks and balances?” Gilmore said. “I know what the answer is going to be, and respectfully sir, I just don’t think that cuts it for me.”
Gilmore said he was still “boggled” by how Hardin got the markers to dye the uniform, and that there needed to be supervision. Outstanding questions like that, Gilmore added, needed to be answered.
“I have no idea. I don’t think you can even explain that, because you didn’t last time,” Gilmore said.
Hardin was sentenced to 80 years on murder and rape charges. He was convicted of the murder of a man in Gateway in 2017 and received 30 years. He later pled guilty to two counts of rape in 2019 after his DNA was a match in a 20-year-old cold case, and was sentenced to an additional 50 years in prison.

Burt Jones received the endorsement he was hoping for in his 2026 run for governor: that of President Donald Trump.
“Burt Jones for Governor has my Complete and Total Endorsement – HE WILL NEVER LET YOU DOWN!” Trump posted on his Truth Social platform Monday evening.
Jones relished the attention in a post featuring a picture of him standing next to a thumbs-up-giving Trump.
“We’re fighting for election integrity, lower taxes, and to secure Georgia values — and with Trump’s support, we’re just getting started,” Jones’ post read.
Jones was an early backer of Trump’s first campaign in 2016, and among his most ardent supporters following Trump’s loss in 2020.
Then a state senator, Jones was one of 16 Republicans who signed certificates falsely pronouncing Trump the winner in Georgia. He also pushed Gov. Brian Kemp to call a special legislative session to overturn the election results.
Last year, a special prosecutor concluded that charges should not be brought against Jones.
Jones continued to support Trump and appeared beside him at Georgia rallies through the 2024 election.
The endorsement hardly comes as a surprise given the closeness between the two men, but it could be a major boon in May’s Republican primary. The only other announced high-profile Republican candidate is Attorney General Chris Carr.
Despite dwindling popularity among independent voters, Trump enjoys near-universal support among Republicans – an April Atlanta Journal-Constitution poll found about 85% of Georgia Republicans support Trump.
Democrats, led by candidates like state Sen. Jason Esteves of Atlanta, former Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms and former DeKalb County CEO Mike Thurmond, are likely hoping that Jones’ snuggling up to Trump in the primary could hurt him in a general election. Despite the strong showing among GOP faithful, the same AJC poll showed Trump’s overall approval rating in Georgia at a meager 43%, with the majority of those disapproving identifying as independents.
Jones also likely carries a financial advantage – Carr is suing Jones alleging that a special campaign finance structure called a leadership committee allows Jones to flaunt fundraising limits imposed upon other candidates.
But Carr’s campaign shrugged off the endorsement.
“Chris Carr is the only conservative Republican who can win the primary and the general election,” said spokesperson Julia Mazzone in a statement Monday night. “The Attorney General will continue to work with President Trump now and as Governor on the issues that matter to hardworking Georgians.”
Carr ruffled Trump’s feathers after his 2020 loss by declining to sign on to efforts to overturn the election, but he has since sought to get back on the president’s good side.
A Trump endorsement has been seen as a golden ticket for a Republican seeking elected office, but a note from the big guy hasn’t always guaranteed success.
In 2022, Trump endorsed a slate of primary candidates up and down Georgia ballots, most of whom went home losers on election night – and that included John Gordon, who went up against Carr but lost by more than 47% of the vote.

(Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)The Montana Public Service Commission will be scheduling a meeting soon to gather information on data centers following a series of recent announcements about new operations in the Treasure State.
PSC President Brad Molnar said Monday the commission will call on NorthWestern Energy to participate in the public meeting — expected to be scheduled in the coming weeks and also address AI — and outline its current and potential plans to support data centers.
NorthWestern Energy announced last month it had signed a letter of intent to “provide energy services” for Quantica Infrastructure’s proposed data center development in Montana.
NorthWestern said the energy load for Quantica’s first phase of development would be 500 megawatts. Quantica announced construction of the Big Sky Digital Infrastructure campus outside Billings would begin in 2026.
The announcement about the development in Billings comes on the heels of news other data centers are looking to open up shop in Montana — and the potential opportunities and problems those operators would bring.
NorthWestern Energy provides roughly 750 megawatts of power on average to existing Montana customers, and the new proposals would total at least 2,100 megawatts, according to the Montana Environmental Information Center.
Quantica Infrastructure, based in Texas, did not respond Monday to an email with questions about its plans including a specific location for its campus and number of people it plans to employ.
However, an economic researcher in Montana said data centers can create jobs with higher-than-average wages, albeit more so during construction phases, and they can make notable property tax contributions to government coffers.
But environmental advocates said the facilities will require significant energy and water for cooling, and existing customers should not have to foot the bill for the new data centers.
“If new generation and transmission infrastructure are being built to serve these data centers, Montana ratepayers should not be subsidizing those costs,” said Ben Catton, with the MEIC.
In an email, NorthWestern Energy spokesperson Jo Dee Black said the utility will work toward ensuring new large customers pay their fair share.
“NorthWestern Energy is planning to pursue proactive steps to ensure new commercial large energy customers pay the cost of their integration and the services they require,” Black said. “We will work with the Montana Public Service Commission to ensure these new customers contribute equitably to the infrastructure and operational costs tied to their service.”
Energy use isn’t the only concern, though. Rep. Jane Gillette, R-Three Forks, said she’s not an expert on data centers, but she pays attention to water because of the agriculture needs in her area, and data centers are heavy water users.
At a recent meeting of the Water Policy Interim Committee, Gillette, who is not on the committee, suggested the group study how data centers will affect water supplies.
Gillette said Monday she hopes related legislative studies on water and energy can guide lawmakers in the future when it comes to data centers.
“I want to believe there’s a pathway for moving forward because the data centers aren’t going away,” Gillette said to the Daily Montanan. “That’s a fact.”
 ***

On July 30, NorthWestern Energy announced it had signed a letter of intent — as NorthWestern Energy Group — to support Quantica Infrastructure, including an initial load of 500 megawatts and potential growth of up to 1 gigawatt.
The news release said NorthWestern was conducting a transmission study to assess how best to meet the company’s needs. It also said Quantica “has several generation projects in development” along with infrastructure that would integrate with the existing grid.
In its own news release, Quantica said its capacity would be 500 megawatts of renewable power and battery storage initially for its “5,000-acre energy, real estate and telecommunications campus.”
NBC Montana reported Quantica plans to build up to 1 gigawatt of on-site renewable generation.
In a statement, NorthWestern President and CEO Brian Bird said the “collaboration” reflects the utility’s commitment to “innovation,” economic development and delivering high-quality energy services.
“We’re actively working with Quantica to optimize the transmission infrastructure and generation resources needed to support this project,” Bird said in a statement. “Montana’s clean energy portfolio, reliable grid, and competitive rates make it an attractive location for new industries.”
In a statement provided by NorthWestern, Quantica CEO John Chesser said the project would create “meaningful employment opportunities along with improvements in telecommunications and power infrastructure for Montanans.”
Chesser also said the development would use “resilient power backed by dedicated renewable energy.”
NorthWestern Energy said it anticipates it could provide service to Quantica “through its regulated business,” pending regulatory considerations. It said the approach “could improve cost efficiency” by spreading infrastructure expenses across “a broader customer base.”
 ***

MEIC, however, said ratepayers should not be subsidizing the costs of new generation and transmission infrastructure, and NorthWestern’s statement about spreading costs across more customers is “concerning.”
“We’re also alarmed by the avalanche of announcements of data centers coming to Montana,” said the MEIC’s Ben Catton in an email also citing environmental and health costs as a concern.
Catton outlined those announcements for an upcoming MEIC newsletter for the nonprofit, which advocates for clean and affordable energy.
Those include an announcement in December by NorthWestern to supply two data centers with a combined 400 MWs, including one the utility confirmed is a Sabey Data Center subsidiary in Butte; an announcement in June by TAC Data Center to build a data center in Great Falls that will require up to 600 MWs; and announcements last month by two more companies, Krambu with plans for a 100 MW facility, and Quantica, according to MEIC.
In an email, the MEIC’s Nick Fitzmaurice said the total generation needed for those projects would be roughly three times NorthWestern Energy’s current average output and require “massive capital investments into generation and grid infrastructure.”
“There is a theoretical scenario where costs are shared across these new customers in a way that puts downward pressure on other customers’ rates, but that seems to be an extremely unlikely outcome,” Fitzmaurice said in an email. “These data centers are shopping around to utilities across the country, looking for the best deal they can get on electricity.
“It is likely that many of these projected loads will never be built if these companies jump from Montana to wherever else they can get a better deal. If NWE does entice them to build here, it would likely be through preferential electricity contracts that would subsidize data center energy on the backs of other customers, not the other way around.”
 ***

PSC President Molnar said the PSC’s job at the upcoming meeting will be to investigate the information NorthWestern provides so it can make decisions on any related rules that are needed based on the facts.
“It’s our job to be prepared and to drill down on what they say,” Molnar said.
He also said it will be important to hear directly from NorthWestern Energy’s top leader about the utility’s plans, not just from its lobbyists.
“I don’t care what they say. I want to know what he says,” Molnar said.
He said a special rate classification might be in order for data centers to ensure they pay their fair share. Molnar also said it’s important that wholly owned subsidiaries of private companies don’t end up putting other ratepayers at risk, or “bleed back on customers.”
Even though Quantica plans to build renewable energy to service AI and its data center, he said, it needs instantaneous backup with natural gas in order to not lose data in an emergency.
 ***

Although the data centers come with risks and high energy demands, Jeff Michael, with the Bureau of Business and Economic Research at the University of Montana, said they also represent economic development.
Michael said the construction phase can bring significant employment, and the data centers themselves bring permanent jobs, and they pay well.
“Especially in Montana, a couple hundred ongoing jobs that pay above average is certainly a benefit that can’t be ignored,” said Michael, who also noted he is not an expert in data centers.
Additionally, he said, the facilities pay high property taxes as “giant structures full of electronics” with a lot of value inside, he said. He said they can generate revenue for a local community “without generally putting huge demands on community infrastructure.”
As they evaluate locations, he said, those companies are looking at energy costs, the costs of development, and the operating and regulatory environment.
The industry is expanding nationwide and beyond, and the business climate might be in their favor in Montana, although it isn’t the first place they’re looking, he said.
“They’re looking for a lot of opportunities,” he said. “It’s probably a little less costly to operate here, and maybe somewhat less resistant than they might be getting in some other areas.”
At the Water Policy Interim Committee, at least a couple of legislators, including Reps. Jill Cohenour, D-Helena, and Terry Sharp, R-Lake County, agreed data centers should be part of the group’s upcoming work.
“How are we going to address these new commercial uses that are going to come online?” Cohenour said.
She said Gov. Greg Gianforte wants to provide incentives for such companies, and the committee should be prepared to talk about the implications.
Rep. Gillette, who wants to learn more about impacts on water, said the economic development potential reminds her of the tourism industry and questions it raises, such as whether Montana is being “loved to death.”

(Photo by Jerry Cornfield/Washington State Standard)As Democratic Party leaders nationwide search for a rebuttal to President Donald Trump in next year’s midterms, voters in Washington state delivered one in the Aug. 5 primary.
Nine Democratic state lawmakers, all appointed, faced voters in essentially a referendum on their service and the path their party has been on. All nine won. 
Four faced experienced opponents in what were viewed as predictors of the political climate seven months into a second Trump administration, and after passage of tax hikes, budget cuts and liberal laws by the Democrat-controlled state Legislature. 
What transpired was not only a rebuke of Trump’s leadership, but also a blow to those pining to see the Democrat-led state Legislature temper its tax-and-spend ways. 
Progressive voters turned out in greater numbers than previous odd-year elections, a reflection of how Trump inspires his political opponents and of how this core constituency hasn’t wavered.
In two Senate contests, Democratic Sens. Deb Krishnadasan and Victoria Hunt held off state Rep. Michelle Caldier and former state lawmaker Chad Magendanz, respectively. 
The GOP challengers focused on what they consider to be the deleterious effects of the majority Democrats. The incumbent senators and their allies countered by associating the Republicans with Trump, his policies, or the MAGA movement.
A similar strategy played out in the House race between two Democrats, Rep. Edwin Obras, a progressive, and Burien Mayor Kevin Schilling. 
Schilling, the more centrist of the two, pledged to focus on rising costs, community safety and avoiding political extremism. As Obras trumpeted upholding the Democrats’ legislative agenda, his allies tagged Schilling as a MAGA accomplice because a political committee supporting him got money from a Trump supporter.
Meanwhile, in another all-Democrat race, Sen. Vandana Slatter, a liberal, beat Rep. Amy Walen, a moderate, by a double-digit margin. Slatter campaigned as the real Democrat, painting Walen as too business-friendly. Trump popped up in this contest, too, appearing in a mailer sent by a pro-Slatter group insisting the senator was on the “front lines” fighting the president.
Special interests operating independent of the candidates in these four marquee contests collectively spent $1.5 million trying to sway voters. While more money went to hammering the appointed Democrats, dollars used to knit a candidate — regardless of party — with Trump or the MAGA movement, paid dividends by deterring voters from that person.
The results show Trump continues to drag down Republican candidates in suburbia and progressives are in no mood to cede ground they’ve secured at the state level.
“Trump had a huge effect on this year’s primary and will continue to have a huge effect on this year’s election,” said veteran strategist Dean Nielsen of CN4 Partners in Seattle. “If there’s one thing that unites Democratic voters, it’s Donald Trump.”
For the appointed Democratic state lawmakers, winning the Aug. 5 primary was only the first step. To retain their seats, they’ll need to win again on Nov. 4.
‘We need to get our voters out’
Republicans set their sights this year on winning Senate seats in the 26th Legislative District spanning parts of Pierce and Kitsap counties and the 5th district in east King County. 
The duel between Krishnadasan, a former school board director, and Caldier, a six-term representative, is the Republicans’ best opportunity to gain ground in the chamber, where Democrats hold a 30-19 seat advantage. 
The campaign waged by Caldier focused on Democrats’ passage of billions in new business taxes, new social policies and a 6-cent per gallon gas tax hike. But she couldn’t overcome the counterpunches from a pro-Krishnadasan political committee linking her with Trump. After leading on election night, she now trails.
“These results show that voters are unhappy with the direction of politics in DC,” Caldier said in a text last week. “However, this race has everything to do with our quality of life here at home. The people in my community were just saddled with the largest tax increase in our state’s history. I’ll be spending the next three months telling that story and working to represent my neighbors who can’t afford what this supermajority keeps doing.”
In the 5th district, Hunt defended the Democrats’ approach on taxes and the budget as necessary to protect vital services in the face of threats from the policies of the president and congressional Republicans. She leads Magendanz by nearly 9%.
A typical mailer put out by a pro-Hunt political committee hit those themes – not her votes to raise taxes, boost fees and expand government regulation. She was portrayed as one who will stand up to Trump and labeled Magendanz as a “Republican extremist.”

Sen. Drew MacEwen, R-Shelton, chair of the Senate Republican Campaign Committee, insisted there are still paths to victory for both candidates.
“I don’t think people are engaged yet. We need to get our voters out,” he said. As for a counterweight to Trump, he said “people are starting to wake up to the fact their pocketbook is impacted” by what Democrats did in session.
He also said, “if asked,” he would tell those backing pro-business candidates to “abandon” the 48th District. That’s where Slatter is beating Walen by a lot in an all-Democrat match-up.
The choice there is between someone who votes 100% of the time with the majority party and someone who votes 95% of the time, MacEwen said. Electing two business-friendly Republicans to the Senate would change the political math in that chamber, he said.
“Do we have our work cut out for us? Absolutely,” he said.
Democrat vs. Democrat and Trump still creeps in
It was in the 33rd District race where Obras’ backers hit Schilling with a mailer saying MAGA “found their man.”
The reason: Pragmatic Washington, a pro-Schilling political committee funded largely by the Washington State Dental Association, received a $10,000 contribution from Steve Gordon, a Republican business owner who has endorsed Trump policies.
Obras garnered nearly 47% in the primary to Schilling’s 31%. Republican Darryl Jones picked up 22%.
Schilling, the mayor of Burien, declined to comment on the mailer. But he’s banking on voters in November being less ideological and more moderate than those in the primary. More than half the voters did not support the representative, he said, adding that he still sees a lane to victory.
Jared Leopold of the New Direction political committee had a different take. The committee, which supports incumbent and progressive Democrats, is funded largely by the Democratic caucuses of the House and Senate, and statewide teacher and health care worker unions.
“Running against the Democrat agenda in Olympia is not a successful campaign strategy,” he said. “People want a fighter right now with Trump. People want a Democrat who is going to fight back.”
There are echoes here of what Shasti Conrad, chair of the Washington State Democratic Party, said in January in her breakdown of the 2024 election — a perspective that helped provide the springboard to her new leadership post with the national party.
Conrad argued the blueprint for Democrats’ success in Washington last year, including a sweep of nine statewide executive posts and gains in the Legislature, is one the party can use to win back control of Congress and the White House.
“Progressive policies are popular,” she wrote in her analysis. “When we can show our policies in action and make people’s lives better at the state level, we can win more elections.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/unnamed-5-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-11 21:56:25.232001

Flood barriers have been installed since last year's flooding, but city officials are still asking for voluntary evacuations of the area. (Photo courtesy of City and Borough of Juneau)Officials in Alaska’s capital city are asking residents to voluntarily evacuate from parts of the Mendenhall Valley ahead of an expected glacial flood this week.
Last year’s flood damaged more than 290 homes in the valley, a largely suburban district of Juneau that is located near the Mendenhall Glacier, and while city officials have constructed temporary barriers to deter future flooding, those barriers haven’t yet been tested in an actual emergency.
“We are issuing those evacuation advisories, because although we are extremely confident in the HESCO barriers’ capability to protect neighborhoods, we’re not willing to bet on that with anybody’s life — or safety,” said Ryan O’Shaughnessy, director of emergency programs for the City and Borough of Juneau. 
The Mendenhall Glacier Recreation Area, Alaska’s most-visited tourist destination, is preparing to shut down as well. The Nugget Falls Trail, the most-used pathway in the area, was closed to the public on Monday. 
Officials from the U.S. Forest Service, which operates the glacier tourist site, did not participate in a media briefing Monday. Agencies at that briefing said the Mendenhall Glacier is short-staffed. The recreation site experienced widespread layoffs as part of a broader federal reduction in force earlier this year.
Late Sunday night, cellphones across Juneau rang with warning tones as city officials sent out an alert: Water has begun to overtop an ice dam that allows the creation of a glacial lake each summer.
Officials expect that within a week, the water will gush from the dam and into Mendenhall Lake, which lays at the glacier’s foot. From there, water will surge into the Mendenhall River and toward homes. 
The first glacial outburst flood at Mendenhall Glacier happened in 2011, but the flooding was initially minor. Because the glacier is shrinking due to climate change, the floods have grown worse over time, culminating in last year’s disaster. 
Aaron Jacobs, a hydrologist with the National Weather Service in Juneau, said this year’s ice dam is lower by 13 feet than it was last year, but the glacial lake — located in a place called Suicide Basin — contains about as much water as it did last year because melting ice elsewhere has increased the capacity of the basin.
“We’re expecting very similar volume estimates from last year,” he said.
That volume, about 16 billion gallons, weighs almost 67 million tons, the equivalent weight of 335 fully loaded container ships rushing through a normally placid river. 
Eight inches of rain fell on and near the basin in recent days, Jacobs said, and hydrographs show that the level of Mendenhall Lake and River have risen.
That’s a little misleading: The lake and river will fall over the next few days as the rain diminishes, then will surge once the ice dam fails to contain the basin. 
It isn’t clear how bad the resulting flood will be. That depends on things as varied as the tide, rainfall and the success or failure of the flood barriers.
O’Shaughnessy said officials will send out another emergency text alert to Juneau cellphones before the peak flood. 
An emergency evacuation shelter has been set up at nearby Floyd Dryden school, and both state and local officials have issued preemptive disaster declarations as a precaution.

(Photo courtesy of the University of Idaho).A stalled legislative proposal this year that would have dismantled a decades-long partnership for Idaho medical students eventually led to a working group looking at increasing medical education in the Gem State. 
The Idaho Medical Education Working Group — made up of two legislators and stakeholders from the Idaho Hospital Association, Idaho Medical Association, Idaho State Board of Education, Idaho’s current medical education programs, and a physician from the state Graduate Medical Education Committee — met for the first time Monday at the Capitol in Boise.

Co-Chair Rep. Dustin Manwaring, R-Pocatello, said at the meeting that the group was formed as a continuation of a discussion started during the 2025 legislative session, and the goal is to create a plan to expand medical education opportunities for Idaho students. 
“All of us have a passion to address our physician shortage in Idaho,” Manwaring said Monday. “It’s frankly, in my opinion, a crisis.” 
Manwaring during the legislative session introduced House Bill 176, which would have ended Idaho’s partnership with the University of Washington Medical School through WWAMI, which stands for Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana, and Idaho, and moved seats to another medical school program. Manwaring cited frustration with UW over not expanding the number of Idaho seats by 10, as the Legislature asked it to in 2022, and a long delay in signing an amended contract agreeing not to include abortion training in Idaho students’ education. 
The bill sparked strong backlash from health care providers, clinical instructors, and current and former students from the program. 
Amid the backlash, Manwaring introduced a new bill that instead directed the state to look into adding more seats for Idaho students in other programs, the Idaho Capital Sun reported. House Bill 368 originally would have also cut 10 seats from WWAMI, but was later amended so that the existing program would remain intact. 
As a result of HB 368, which was signed into law in April, the group is tasked with creating a plan for the governor and Legislature to reduce Idaho’s physician shortage, link graduate and undergraduate medical education, maintain and increase high quality programs for Idaho’s medical students, keep more money spent on medical education within Idaho, and expand cooperation among education partners and minimize conflicts. 
 Idaho has no public medical school in its borders; this is how its doctors are trained. 

Working group members on Monday got a detailed lay of the land when it comes to training future Idaho doctors. 
Without a public medical school in Idaho, the state supports 40 seats at the UW medical school through WWAMI and 10 seats at the University of Utah’s medical school. 
WWAMI students spend their first two years of classroom education at the University of Idaho’s Moscow campus, during which the state’s funding for those students goes to the U of I. The students then spend their next two years doing clinical rotations, which could take place in any of the program’s partner states, and at which point Idaho’s state support goes to the UW. The state pays on average $44,000 per student, which does not support tuition but supports the students’ education and reserves their seat, said Rayme Geidl, interim co-director of the U of I School of Health and Medical Professions and interim regional dean of Idaho WWAMI medical education. 
Idaho’s 10 students who train in Utah spend their first year of classroom education at the campus in Salt Lake City, and their second year doing a new process of “longitudinal integrated clerkships,” in which students may rotate specialties daily. During years three and four, students may focus on a specialty, and at this point Idaho students return to the Gem State for their primary care rotation, according to Ben Chan, associate dean of admissions and associate dean of Idaho affairs at the University of Utah. 
Idaho State University has a number of health education programs, including nursing, dental hygiene, counseling and graduate programs in pharmacy, dentistry, and a family medicine residency, said Rex Force, ISU vice president for health sciences. 
The panel also heard from the state’s private, for-profit institution, the Idaho College of Osteopathic Medicine, or ICOM, which has been running since 2018. 
This year, 37 students of the class of 225 students were from Idaho, said Kevin Wilson, dean and chief academic officer at ICOM. 
So far, all of the Idaho students who’ve trained at the school have chosen to remain in Idaho for clinical rotations at its core core sites in the Treasure Valley, Magic Valley and in eastern Idaho, Wilson said.

 Clinical sites are a challenge to expanding undergraduate medical education in Idaho 

During med school, students are required to spend time doing clinical rotations, in which they work in health care settings and receive training from practitioners. The providers who oversee their clinical training are known as preceptors, and those who spoke Monday indicated it is hard to find enough of them in Idaho. 
This issue also came up frequently during the 2025 legislative session when Manwaring questioned WWAMI representatives as to why the program hadn’t yet expanded seats for Idaho students.  
Multiple presenters indicated a number factors that drive this shortage including the fact that the state has lost several OB-GYNs and thus preceptors in that field are limited and there is a competition among health care programs that makes it more difficult to place students. 
Doctors left Idaho after abortion ban, study confirms

More than 40% of Idaho’s practicing obstetricians have left the state since the state’s near-total felony abortion ban took effect, the Idaho Capital Sun reported. 
Force, with ISU, said that the school has to place physician assistant and nurse practitioner students and so do other programs such as Lewis Clark State College and community colleges. 
“It’s a very crowded, competitive learning environment,” Force said. 
Speakers also said that taking on a medical student can mean a doctor has to see fewer patients, which can impact a clinic’s income. Some programs pay preceptors for the students they see, and others, such as ISU, do not. 
This can create a challenge, said work force member Dr. Ted Epperly, graduate medical education coordinator for the state of Idaho and CEO of Full Circle Health. 
 Public comment centers on supporting WWAMI 

Five physicians spoke during the public comment portion of Monday’s meeting, and all of them were connected to WWAMI in some way and all of them had a similar message: keep WWAMI in place while exploring outside options.

All of the speakers said they supported the mission of the working group, but asked that they maintain Idaho’s partnership with UW, which they noted, is consistently top-ranked among medical schools in the nation. 
“Because Idaho WWAMI is a public entity, it prioritizes Idahoans’ needs and not profits, not anything else,” said Joey Florence, a doctor at Full Circle Health.
Working group co-Chair Sen. Dave Lent, R-Idaho Falls, said he appreciates what WWAMI has done over the years, but more needed to be done. 
“We love it,” he said. “We love you participating in this. But the state’s growing, and we have to look to the future.” 
The working group plans to meet again Aug. 26.

Fifty four people applied for the top job at the Trust, with Adams advancing to the final round with one other applicant, the Trust announced by press release. The job paid $120,852-a-year as of 2023.
Adams holds a Bachelor of Science degree in fisheries and wildlife with an emphasis on conservation biology.
In a statement, Adams pledged to lead the Trust “with transparency and a renewed commitment to public engagement, while adhering to NET’s updated laws, policies and procedures.”
The Environmental Trust was created along with the Nebraska Lottery, which provides about $20 million a year for the Trust to distribute in competitive grants aimed at “conserving, enhancing and restoring Nebraska’s natural environments.”
In recent years, applications for grants have declined substantially, with some previous recipients declining to seek additional grants due to new requirements that have increased the number of applications deemed “ineligible.”
In addition, Gov. Jim Pillen and state lawmakers carved out about $13 million from the Trust’s annual lottery allotment next year to help close the state’s budget deficit — a move that prompted the threat of a lawsuit.
In a statement, Adams said she would work to “rebuild trust and increase (the) impact” of the Trust “by maintaining open communication and consistency with our grantees.”
Sandy Scofield, president of the group Friends of the Environmental Trust, said Monday she wasn’t surprised by the selection of Adams.
“We’ve always worked well with her,” said Scofield, a former state senator. “She certainly has the experience to run the grant program.”

(Photo by Christine Condon/ Maryland Matters)Baltimore Gas & Electric briefly urged customers to conserve electricity Monday afternoon after an transmission facility failure forced a Maryland power plant offline, which could have caused “possible widespread outages.”
By Monday evening, the utility said it believed the problem was solved and the threat had passed. But that came after several hours in which BGE,  in a news release, asked its customers to take steps such as turning off nonessential appliances and using less air conditioning, including by closing their blinds and turning on ceiling fans. It also urged ratepayers to set aside supplies of food and water, and charge critical electronic devices in case of an outage.
“We are asking all BGE customers to conserve electricity beginning immediately and through this evening. Energy conservation helps reduce the potential for an outage,” read the news release. “If an outage becomes necessary, we will make every effort to alert customers in advance.”
A BGE transmission facility that serves the Brandon Shores coal-fired power plant in Anne Arundel County failed at about 3 a.m. Monday, according to a spokesperson for Talen Energy, which owns the plant. By Monday afternoon, “electricity demand briefly exceeded the current capacity of the local transmission system,” according to PJM Interconnection which runs the utility grid serving Maryland.
At 3:52 p.m., PJM directed BGE to lower flows across overloaded lines, resulting in “limited outages” to customers, wrote PJM spokesman Jeffrey Shields. That directive was canceled by 4:20 p.m, after BGE restored parts of the transmission system.
“We expect that BGE will soon be returning to service those customers who were shed as part of our original directive,” Shields wrote. “Continued reliable operation of the local transmission system will depend upon the operability of the transmission facilities that tripped this morning, but for now, the system is in a place such that we can serve our peak evening demand in the area.”

The Brandon Shores plant was scheduled to shut down in May, along with Talen’s nearby oil-burning H.A. Wagner plant. But amid rising demand for power, regulators compelled the facilities to stay open through May 2029 using a “reliability must-run” agreement. Ratepayers are footing the $180 million annual bill.
The Maryland Office of People’s Counsel has argued that  ratepayers are essentially paying twice for the “must run” agreement, since the two plants were excluded from a key energy auction held in 2024, raising prices considerably. The People’s Counsel is pushing federal regulators to return $5 billion in auction proceeds to customers as a result.
When the transmission failure occurred Monday morning, Brandon Shores’ Unit 1 and Unit 2 facilities were both operating, but “tripped offline” because of the infrastructure failure, wrote Taryne Williams, a spokesperson for Talen Energy, in a statement.
The first of those units cannot contribute power to the grid until BGE repairs the infrastructure, Williams wrote. As of Monday afternoon, though, the second unit was “available for power generation upon completion of the start-up process.” The same was true for the nearby H.A. Wagner plant, which is served by the same transmission infrastructure, Williams said.
Asked about the outage during a news conference Monday, Maryland Senate President Bill Ferguson (D- Baltimore City) was quick to say that the infrastructure issue impacting Brandon Shores was distinct from the energy supply constraints that were discussed in the legislature earlier this year.
“This is not a matter of there being a lack of supply in the marketplace right now, which is something that we have been talking about the potential of in several years,” Ferguson said. “This is — as you would expect in the case of a thunderstorm or lightning storm — when a pole goes down and the transmission has to be rerouted. That’s what we’re seeing here, except in this case, it was a substation that was taking in electricity and distributing it across the grid from a pretty major transmission station.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/HEADSHOT-141-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-11 20:57:00.202826

As property owners across Sussex County begin receiving their 2026 tax bills, officials have unveiled a new online tool to help residents understand how those bills are calculated—especially following the county’s long-awaited property reassessment.
The updated tax calculator, now live on the county’s website, provides parcel-specific estimates using real assessment data and finalized tax rates.
It replaces an earlier version that relied on projections, offering users a more accurate breakdown of what they owe and why.

The reassessment, the first in decades, has led to changes in many property valuations, which could mean increases—or decreases—in tax bills.
County Finance Director Gina A. Jennings said the new tool aims to bring clarity and transparency to the process.
“There are multiple reasons beyond just the assessment that could change bills, so we wanted to create a calculator that showed the difference between tax bills last year versus this year,” Jennings said. “In the interest of transparency, and to help the public understand what’s changed, we believe the new calculator will be a handy tool in providing a side-by-side comparison of the two different tax years.”
The calculator is available here.

Blake Tillery and family at the state Capitol announcing his candidacy for lieutenant governor. Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderVidalia Republican state Sen. Blake Tillery has joined the race to become Georgia’s next lieutenant governor in 2026.
The second-highest executive office in the state will be open next year because Lt. Gov. Burt Jones is running for governor.
Tillery, who was first elected to his south Georgia district in 2016, launched his campaign Monday with a fly-around with stops including Savannah, Augusta, Columbus and Perry.
During a stop at the state Capitol in Atlanta, Tillery said that he will prioritize conservative values.
“I believe that we should continue to focus on items that matter to Georgians, and I want my kids to be raised in a Georgia just like I was, one that believes in faith in God and puts Georgia values first, the same Georgia values and faith in God that were instilled in me by my parents,” he said.
During this year’s session, Tillery authored a series of red-meat conservative bills, including penalizing so-called sanctuary cities, banning transgender state workers from receiving gender-affirming care through the state health plan and preventing banks from punishing conservatives because of their beliefs. None of these bills passed into law, but they remain in play for when lawmakers reconvene in January.
Tillery, who chairs the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee that is responsible for helping shape the state’s budget, also pledged to eliminate the state income tax if elected lieutenant governor.
The lieutenant governor’s chief duty is to preside over the state Senate, and three other state senators have announced they will also campaign for the role.
Sandy Springs Democratic Sen. Josh McLaurin is so far the only declared candidate from his party.
“Blake is a mostly soft-spoken guy who may have trouble banking far enough right to outdo his primary opponents,” McLaurin said in a text. “But you can bank on him trying.”
If Tillery hopes to face the Democratic nominee next November, he’ll first have to succeed in the GOP primary in May. And two other powerful Republican senators also have their eyes set on Georgia’s lieutenant governor’s perch: Senate Majority Leader Steve Gooch of Dahlonega and Senate President Pro Tem John Kennedy of Macon.
In a statement following Tillery’s announcement, Kennedy characterized himself as the candidate focused on results.
“As a lifelong Georgian from Adrian, I was raised on small town values and understand the importance of leadership focused on conservative results, not rhetoric. For the past ten years, I’ve been fighting for Georgia families and delivering real results under the Gold Dome,” Kennedy said
Speaking with reporters after his Atlanta appearance, Tillery said he, Kennedy and Gooch are largely aligned on policy, but he characterized himself as a leader.
“When we went to make sure that the state was not paying for transgender surgeries, I was carrying that. And we went to make sure that we weren’t funding woke ideologies in the budget, I was carrying that. So I appreciate their support. They’ve carried things too that I’ve supported,” Tillery said.
A House lawmaker, Buford Republican David Clark, has also filed paperwork to run for the post.

From left: Pulaski County Judge Barry Hyde, Little Rock Mayor Frank Scott Jr., Commerce Secretary Hugh McDonald and Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders. (Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)International pipe fabricator Welspun Corp. will open a new facility in Little Rock by next year, a nearly $150 million investment that will create 175 new jobs, CEO Vipul Mathur and state officials said Monday.
Welspun has operated a pipe and coating plant at the Port of Little Rock since 2007, and Monday’s announcement is the company’s second expansion since Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders took office in 2023. In October 2024, the company announced a $100 million investment to add 175 jobs to its plant on the Arkansas River and increase the variety of its pipe production, according to the Arkansas Economic Development Commission.
Mathur said the new facility will be up and running by this time next year, and he called the project “one of the most unique facilities in the country.”
“Under one roof, we will be covering just about every single diameter of pipe that is going to be used,” Mathur said. “It is a one-stop solution.”
Welspun’s products primarily serve the energy industry, including oil, gas and data centers. The company is headquartered in India and is part Welspun World, an international conglomerate. Welspun Corp. expanded into plastics and building materials in 2023, according to its website. 
The pipe maker has a corporate office in Houston, but Little Rock is where Welspun has put its “maximum investment” globally, Mathur said.
At a press conference in Sanders’ Capitol conference room, Little Rock Mayor Frank Scott Jr. and Pulaski County Judge Barry Hyde both praised Welspun’s decision to expand, calling it a good sign for Little Rock and Pulaski County’s economy.
“Today is an example of strategic recruitment of a bold company, the ability for the community to retain said company, and now continuous expansion,” Scott said. “That expansion is because of our teamwork, state, local and community, to ensure that we not only have the workers but that we provide exceptional customer service to business owners.”
Sanders called Arkansas “the most hospitable state” for business growth, touting her trade mission to Israel and the United Arab Emirates last week. The trip focused on business relationships between Arkansas and Middle Eastern companies, particularly in the defense and aerospace industries. Sanders signed a nonbinding economic development agreement with Israel’s National Technological Innovation Authority last week.
Arkansas lawmakers approve legislation aimed at mitigating energy bill spikes

Arkansas Secretary of Commerce Hugh McDonald said Monday that what draws businesses to the state includes “great workforce development efforts,” “common-sense public policy” and lower taxes than other states, McDonald said.
Arkansas lawmakers and Sanders have lowered income taxes three times since April 2023.
Sanders also touted a streamlined “regulatory timeline for new energy assets” at Monday’s press conference. The Arkansas Public Service Commission must approve a strategic energy investment within six months of application, according to the Generating Arkansas Jobs Act of 2025. The approval process previously had been 12 to 18 months.

,Kansas Reflector,2025-08-11 23:49:12+00:00,Kansas Reflector,Kansas task force keeps working to resolve conflicting forces shaping future of water policy,Tim Carpenter,,,,,https://kansasreflector.com/2025/08/11/kansas-task-force-keeps-working-to-resolve-conflicting-forces-shaping-future-of-water-policy/,Kansas Legislature's task force on water continues to study ways of creating balance between supply and demand and interests of the economy and environment.,"A tumbleweed clings to a picnic table at HorseThief Reservoir, which was constructed for flood control, and at times is reduced to a ""puddle"" due to required release of water to satisfy downstream water rights, said Randy Still, general manager of the Pawnee County watershed. He says the reservoir has met flood management expectations, but future releases should be reduced to protect the investment. (AJ Dome for Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The 186 residents of Pawnee Rock want clean water to flow from kitchen faucets, but uranium contamination forced one city well to be taken offline and meant the western Kansas community was down to a single well.
“No redundancy,” said Katie Miller, director of water resources with Kansas Municipal Utilities, an association working on behalf of more than 200 communities. “No backup.”
She told members of the Kansas Water Program Task Force on Monday the solution in Pawnee Rock was to earmark $4.1 million for a new source of water that hopefully would be adequate in supply and quality.
Uranium may be a surprising impediment to operation of a healthy water system, but consequences of Kansas’ overreliance on irrigation for crops, and pollution of surface and groundwater with nitrates prominent in agricultural runoff, made it difficult to guarantee a lasting supply for the 3 million residents of Kansas.
“Nitrates are impacting so many of our utilities,” said Miller, who argued solutions had to be found. “We don’t have a choice from a public health standpoint.”
Cities, counties, the state and a Kansas network of groundwater districts struggle with issues of supply and demand, economic and legal complexities, workforce development, shifting government regulation and unpredictable costs of infrastructure projects while attempting to shape current practices to solidify the water future of Kansas.
The cost of water treatment plants or pipeline projects could easily double or triple in the time required to move from planning to operation.
In the city of Anthony in Harper County, there’s trouble with the $6 million water plant and nine-mile waterline connecting fresh water to 2,000 residents. The project completed in 2016 with a U.S. Department of Agriculture loan became controversial when the pipeline began experiencing frequent cracks running down the spine of piping. Repairs of the fractures cost $275,000 to $350,000 annually, so Miller said the logical remedy was to replace the defective pipe.
She said the problem with installing a new waterline was the estimated cost of $22 million to $32 million.
“We’re looking at a massive waterline project,” Miller said.

Like gold
Harold Nolte, president of Dodge City Community College, set the table for Miller’s assessment and the task force’s broader conversation about the future of water.
“Water is like gold,” Nolte said. “It’s very valuable.”
The task force learned Kansas’ groundwater management districts have been instructed to identify problems and solutions to regional water issues by a July 2026 deadline established in state law.
Orrin Feril, who represents Big Bend Groundwater Management District No. 5, said the district struggled more with water quality than water quantity. The region of Rattlesnake Creek, which is a tributary to the Arkansas River in central Kansas, had resisted attempts to reverse impairments recognized more than a decade ago, he said.
“We’ve tried many different plans. Some successful, some not. Mostly in the latter category,” Feril said. “What we’re dealing with are activities that happened in the past that have impacted the groundwater.”
Rep. Lindsay Vaughn, an Overland Park Democrat serving on the task force, suggested farmers, ranchers and other consumers ought to aggressively pursue water conservation as a self-preservation strategy. She recommended offering incentives to reduce field applications that contributed to nitrate runoff harmful to water resources.
The idea of the Legislature directing groundwater district boards to track application of nitrates may be worthy of consideration, said Sen. Kenny Titus, R-Manhattan.
“Do you think we should be looking at requiring groundwater management districts to more actively manage nitrates and farming practices?” Titus asked Feril.
Historically, Kansas officials have leaned into collaborative reform rather than mandated change to extend life of the Ogallala Aquifer, support dwindling streams and creeks or protect government investments in reservoirs.
“I don’t know how to answer that question,” Feril said. “We have regulatory authority to impose requirements for sampling. The board at this point has taken a different track. They said, ‘Let’s not take that heavy-handed approach. Let’s do it in a voluntary method.’ ”
Jason Norquest, assistant general manager of the Groundwater Management District No. 3, said part of his quest was to develop support from heavy water users for new strategies for extending the life of water resources. In some areas aquifer consumption should fall by as much as 25% over the next couple decades, he said.
Economic consequences of moving closer to a sustainable supply, or better matching the volume of water going in and coming out of the ground, cannot be dismissed by politicians or regulators, he said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_7720-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-08-11 19:56:59.521223

Elijah Nouvelage/Getty ImagesU.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. visited the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention headquarters in Atlanta Monday in the wake of a deadly shooting near the agency’s Roybal Campus that left both the suspected gunman and a police officer dead.
Police said the suspect opened fire shortly before 5 p.m. Friday from across the street at Emory Point, a mixed-use development near Emory University and the CDC. Bullet damage was seen in the walls and windows of at least four buildings on the CDC campus. And the Associated Press reported Monday that the gunman fired more than 180 shots into the campus and broke about 150 windows. 
The shooting suspect has been identified as 30-year-old Patrick Joseph White of Kennesaw, according to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. Police say he was found dead with gunshot wounds on the second floor of a CVS at Emory Point, but have not released further details about possible motives for the shooting. Reporting from the New York Times and CNN allege that the shooter blamed his health issues on the COVID-19 vaccine.

Kennedy — who has repeatedly questioned the safety and efficacy of vaccines and promoted widely debunked claims about vaccine harm — toured the campus alongside Deputy HHS Secretary Jim O’Neill and CDC Director Susan Monarez.
“We know how shaken our public health colleagues feel today,” Kennedy said in a statement posted to X the morning after the shooting. “No one should face violence while working to protect the health of others.”
“We are actively supporting CDC staff on the ground and across the agency,” he added. “Public health workers show up every day with purpose — even in moments of grief and uncertainty.”
But some public health workers and advocates have bristled at Kennedy’s statement, arguing that the secretary has fueled public mistrust of vaccines and public health workers, placing CDC employees in greater danger.
Fired But Fighting, a coalition of former U.S. Department of Health Human Services workers and supporters, called for Kennedy to resign from his role as health secretary.
“​​Kennedy is directly responsible for the villainization of CDC’s workforce through his continuous lies about science and vaccine safety, which have fueled a climate of hostility and mistrust,” the group said in a statement. “The ongoing destruction of our public health infrastructure has destroyed the systems meant to prevent tragedies like this from happening. Cuts to CDC’s injury prevention center, including programs to reduce gun violence and support mental health, have put our country at greater risk.”
  U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff said he was grateful that the committee worked on a bipartisan basis to reject major Trump cuts for the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder (file photo)
Sen. Jon Ossoff, a Democrat who voted against Kennedy’s confirmation as health secretary, also criticized the Trump administration’s cuts to the agency. 
“The CDC has been under sustained political attack since this administration took power,” Ossoff said. “This is the world’s preeminent epidemiological agency responsible for protecting the American people and the world from deadly disease outbreaks, and the Secretary of Health and Human Services is a notorious crank who has embraced, over the course of his career, countless unfounded conspiracy theories about public health.”

Doug LaMalfa largely defended his vote for Trump’s megabill while fielding expletive-laden questions and comments from a hostile crowd.","In summary
At his first in-person town hall since Trump’s megabill became law, Republican Rep. Doug LaMalfa largely defended his vote for Trump’s megabill while fielding expletive-laden questions and comments from a hostile crowd.


Rep. Doug LaMalfa, the Republican who represents much of California’s rural north, had barely begun his prepared remarks at a town hall in Chico early Monday when a chorus of boos and jeers overpowered him. 
The raucous interjections didn’t relent for nearly 90 minutes.
The crowd of more than 650 people at the local Elks Lodge peppered him with obscenity-laden comments and slammed him for his vote for President Donald Trump’s budget bill, which cuts more than $1.1 trillion in federal spending for Medicaid, Medicare and plans under the Affordable Care Act over the next decade. The crowd excoriated LaMalfa for supporting legislation they said will “devastate” rural hospitals and hurt vulnerable people with disabilities and poor families. 
But LaMalfa claimed the legislation makes “no cuts to the people themselves” in California’s Medicaid program, known as Medi-Cal, and instead only targets “waste, fraud and abuse” – a common and misleading line that House Republicans across the country have employed to defend the legislation.
“That’s a lie!” several attendees shouted when LaMalfa trotted out this refrain, amid a chorus of boos. “Shameless!”
“Is this how you get stuff? By yelling?” LaMalfa shot back.
LaMalfa largely defended his record, and those of his party and the president, at his first in-person forum in close to eight years in Chico, a Democratic college town that is one of a few blue dots in his Republican-leaning congressional district. 
Tasked with selling constituents on the president’s new domestic policy law, which polls show is widely unpopular, congressional Republicans across the country have faced hostile crowds as they return to their home districts for the six-week August recess.
Voters in blue cities like Chico have shown up in force at GOP town halls to vent their frustration, which the Democratic Party hopes to channel into a victory at the midterm elections. One town hall in Lincoln, Nebraska played out similarly to LaMalfa’s, with constituents lined up around the block to get inside and then, once in the room, booing incessantly. 
LaMalfa’s town hall also comes as Gov. Gavin Newsom and California Democrats charge ahead with a frenzied effort to redraw the state’s congressional districts to offset Trump’s plan to retain control of the U.S. House by squeezing more Republican seats out of red states like Texas and Florida. The proposed California maps, expected to be made public this week, could draw LaMalfa and four other Republicans into much bluer districts, according to sources who have seen the proposed districts but aren’t authorized to speak publicly. 
The spacious community room was so tightly packed that several turned around and left. Inside, two lines snaked haphazardly down both sides of the room as constituents lined up to ask questions and comment. In an effort to reduce audience outbursts, staff handed out red and green placards for attendees to signal their opinion – but it did little to quiet the crowd.

Mathew Hilliard, a youth mental health counselor and social worker from Mount Shasta, drove more than 2.5 hours and waited outside for another hour to be the first in line to question LaMalfa about his support for the megabill. He told the congressman he was very concerned that defunding Medi-Cal could force rural hospitals in Siskiyou County and across the district to close.
“These facilities are vital to our disabled and our working-class people,” Hilliard said. “How could you support a bill that is going to devastate our already fragile infrastructure?”
LaMalfa, from his perch atop a barstool onstage, responded with the misleading Republican claim that the legislation will instead cut people who he believes should be ineligible for the program, such as people living illegally in the country and able-bodied working adults with no dependents. 
“Ask Gavin Newsom why he wants $12.5 billion to go to people that aren’t even citizens of our state, thereby hurting the Medi-Cal program,” he said.
Newsom expanded Medi-Cal enrollment to people in the country without legal status, but was forced to rein that in this year amid a forecast budget deficit. 
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated that Trump’s legislation will cause more than 10 million people to lose health insurance coverage by 2034, including more than 3.4 million Californians.
While health care dominated the boisterous forum, other questions ranged from Congress’s handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files to the Israel-Gaza war, and multiple commenters lamented White House overreach as Trump pushes the boundaries of executive power. Several people accused LaMalfa of aiding a descent into fascism and unleashed their fury over immigration agents rounding up U.S. citizens and legal residents in indiscriminate raids. 
LaMalfa later agreed that immigration officers “shouldn’t be capturing people that are U.S. citizens,” and he said he would support a pathway to legal status for undocumented workers in crucial industries like farming and services. But he then contradicted himself and said the fear of wrongfully detaining a citizen or legal resident shouldn’t deter officials from casting a wide net, as they have in recent raids at Home Depot parking lots in Sacramento and Los Angeles, and sorting out the wrongfully detained people later.
The in-person, open mic town hall has gradually become a relic in the age of social media, as fewer elected officials are willing to prostrate themselves in today’s hyperpartisan era. House Republicans even discouraged their members from hosting face-to-face forums after a wave of negative headlines out of viral town hall confrontations – including with their own GOP supporters – earlier this year.

LaMalfa’s staff reminded the audience they could get through more questions and comments if they quit interrupting. But there was little appetite for civil discourse, even after several speakers implored their fellow attendees to pipe down.
Ryan Rogoski, a Navy veteran from Chico, told LaMalfa that due to lack of mental health providers in the area, he has to drive three hours round-trip to San Rafael to see a therapist for PTSD, which the congressman admitted was “crazy” and unacceptable. But when Rogoski begged LaMalfa to do something about the provider shortage, LaMalfa blamed it on “a few bad apples” in leadership at the local Chico VA who he said mismanaged existing funds. 
“You’re giving the Pentagon so much money!” Rogoski yelled before storming out of the building in tears. He later told CalMatters that LaMalfa’s answer was “extremely false,” using an expletive to emphasize his frustration. 
“It has nothing to do with taking care of veterans and our unique challenges,” Rogoski said.
Several constituents implored LaMalfa to denounce all the redistricting efforts this year as has fellow California Rep. Kevin Kiley, who recently introduced a bill to ban mid-decade redistricting. 
But LaMalfa said California’s effort was especially reprehensible since voters established an independent redistricting commission nearly 20 years ago. 
“Maybe the people in Texas, maybe the people in other states will put their own commissions in place in order to have it be independent,” LaMalfa said in an interview. “It’s really ugly,” he added. “It doesn’t give you more faith in the political process.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/081124_LaMalfa-TownHall_SO_24.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-11 19:56:59.521223

The New Mexico Environment Department and the New Mexico Department of Health will host a free domestic well water testing event from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Saturday in the Home and Arts Building at 1900 E. Brady Ave in Clovis.
The departments’ event, which they call a “water fair,” coincides with the Curry County Fair. It offers the first 100 well owners who show up the chance to measure pH, specific conductance and levels of nitrates in their water, which the agencies said in a news release are crucial measurements for maintaining safe drinking water.
“Private well owners in Curry County can come to this water fair and find out more about the quality of their household drinking water,” Ground Water Quality Bureau Chief Justin Ball said in a statement. “Free well water testing gives families the knowledge they need to make informed choices about their water and health.”
This fall, the environment department will also hold water fairs in Española, Farmington and Las Cruces, Ground Water Quality Bureau Pollution Prevention Program Manager Jason Herman told Source NM in a statement on Monday. Those events will appear on the agency’s events calendar at least one month in advance, he said.
Since July 2024, the environment department has tested 231 private drinking water wells at seven water fairs, the agency said in a news release.
Department staff try to hold eight water fairs in communities across the state in the spring and fall, Herman said, and they select locations based on inquiries from the public, community need and how long it’s been since the last water fair in the area. The program reaches an area every two to three years because New Mexico is such a large state, he said.
State officials are asking participants to bring a sample of their well water in a container, along with information about their well including overall well depth, depth to water, well casing material, well latitude and longitude and distance between the well and the nearest septic tank or leach field system. Guidelines about how to properly collect a sample can be found on the environment department’s site.
Well owners, their family members or neighbors should bring their water sample to the event for it to be tested. If the owner themselves cannot bring the sample, the container must be clearly labeled with the owner’s name, phone number, address and well information.
Herman said the environment department is equipping all its field offices around the state to do private well water testing, and they anticipate having the service ready by mid-September.

Larry Rhoden, whose Monday announcement said the subject is not a U.S. citizen and is “now in immigration proceedings.”
The estimated street value of the drugs is $12 million, the news release said.
Rhoden used the arrest as an opportunity to tout his Operation Prairie Thunder, which commits state government personnel and resources to assist with the activities of federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

“We are taking action to protect the people of South Dakota from criminals and drug traffickers,” Rhoden said in the release.
His office said the suspect is the eighth person who isn’t a citizen stopped by the Highway Patrol since it signed an agreement to assist ICE earlier this year amid an immigration crackdown by the Trump administration. The state’s Department of Corrections and the Division of Criminal Investigation have also signed agreements with the federal agency.
The type of agreement that the Highway Patrol has with ICE was discontinued during the Obama and Biden administrations, due to concerns about racial profiling. 
The suspect in the meth seizure case is a 42-year-old man who was allegedly stopped for speeding on Interstate 90 in Sturgis. A service dog detected an odor that led to the discovery of the drugs, according to the news release from Rhoden’s office.
Although the release related those and other details of the arrest and said the suspect is charged with three crimes, it did not include his name, making it difficult for South Dakota Searchlight to immediately find court documents related to the case. Department of Public Safety spokesman Brad Reiners declined to provide the name.
“I am unable to release any details on the individual as this is still an active investigation,” Reiners wrote in an email.
The news release said other agencies assisting in the investigation include the Drug Enforcement Administration, FBI, Homeland Security Investigations, Meade County Sheriff’s Office and Rapid City Police Department.

Greg Gianforte announced Monday a new statewide initiative to bolster workforce development in skilled trades and AI usage. 
Gianforte signed Executive Order 5-2025 creating the 406 JOBS Initiative, which directs the Department of Labor and Industry’s State Workforce Innovation Board to put Montana in line with national education and workforce development goals set by President Donald Trump. 
“406 JOBS stands for four pathways to employment, zero barriers to work, and six high-demand sectors,” Gianforte said during a press conference held at Helena’s Boeing manufacturing center on Monday. “Those sectors include health care, construction, hospitality and recreation, advanced manufacturing and computing education and child care and financial and professional services. 
Earlier this year, Trump signed two executive orders directing federal agencies to implement workforce development initiatives focused on training for skilled trade jobs and advancing artificial intelligence in education.  
Within the state, Gianforte’s executive order establishes the State Workforce Innovation Board as the lead coordinating body for 406 JOBS. According to the order, the board will develop and oversee the implementation of the JOBS initiative, “facilitate industry-led workforce strategies that reflect current and future labor market demands, and consult with tribal governments, tribal colleges, and Native-led organizations in the design and implementation of strategies that reflect the needs of tribal communities.”
“Under this plan, we will ensure that our workforce system values all the ways that people enter and move around our labor market — apprenticeships, industry-recognized credentials, Sprint degrees, military service, entrepreneurship and traditional college degree programs,” DLI Commissioner Sarah Swanson said during the press conference. “406 JOBS will focus us on a statewide level, on those things that are keeping people from attaining work.”
According to a DLI report released last week analyzing the roughly 340,000 Montanans who are not actively participating in the labor force, more than 100,000 working-age Montanans are not employed, and not seeking work. 
Citing that data, Swanson said some of those people are “making the choice to be stay at home parents or to retire early, and when family finances allow for that, we celebrate those choices.” But she said others are prevented from participating in the workforce due to serious systemic or lifestyle barriers. 
Those barriers can include a lack of access to child care, chronic illness or disability, criminal justice history, or even challenges transitioning from military to civilian service,” Swanson said.“We need to build some bridges back to work especially in these high demand sectors,” Swanson said.
Jason Yager, a State Workforce and Innovation Board Member and Executive Director of the Montana Photonics & Quantum Alliance, also spoke at the governor’s press conference about the importance of developing a stronger pipeline for workers seeking to enter the labor market in manufacturing and computing fields. 
“I can tell you firsthand that Montana’s opportunities in advanced manufacturing, information technology and computing are enormous,” Yager said. “Companies from all over the world are looking to come to Montana, and they need a skilled, prepared workforce.”
Over the next few weeks, DLI staff and members of the State Workforce Innovation Board will be traveling the state to share more details and goals of the 406 JOBS initiative, and will “seek input from Montana citizens, members of the Montana Legislature, Montana associations whose members are impacted by workforce development challenges, and other appropriate stakeholders,” according to the order. 
“You’ll hear us talking more about industry recognized credentials, apprenticeships, opportunities for young people and more access to training programs in our rural communities,” Yager said.
Gianforte’s executive order also directs DLI to expand the training and use of AI in schools and job fields. 
The initiative directs the Department of Labor to:

promote and expand opportunities that equip Montanans with AI skills
provide professional development opportunities that support educators in incorporating AI-skills development into career awareness and readiness instruction
identify opportunities to integrate AI tools that assist job seekers in navigating career pathways, accessing training, and securing employment
encourage public-private partnerships that accelerate AI workforce development and adoption across key sectors
support small businesses in upskilling workers and incorporating AI technologies into business operations
prioritize digital modernization, including AI-readiness, in workforce service delivery and talent development programs.  

DLI is directed to work with the Office of Public Instruction, the Office of the Commissioner of Higher Education, the Montana University System, and the Department of Commerce for its AI initiatives. 
Through his executive orders, Trump directed some federal funding to states that implement programs like the one announced by Gianforte, which Swanson said the state would seek. 
DLI will be “maximizing the workforce investments that are already in existence in Montana, focusing on letting the private sector and the employers lead and going where they’d like us to follow,” Swanson said. “This is a reorganization of existing agency workforce programs across all of the state agencies that the governor leads.”
Per the executive order, SWIB is expected to deliver an implementation plan within 90 days to examine existing agency workforce initiatives and establish annual reporting mechanisms.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/406-JOBS.png,,,2025-08-11 18:56:47.945606

Terry Lutz, who chaired a work group within the Iowa DOGE task force, said at a meeting Wednesday that one of the recommendations under consideration was “doing away with the current defined benefits program and going to a defined contribution program” for public employees. This change was recommended because compensation packages for government workers through IPERS, the Iowa Public Employees’ Retirement System, are “way out of whack” with private sector compensation, he said.
The proposal on IPERS and other benefits would apply to new employees, while the compensation would remain the same as it currently exists for current employees, Lutz said. Gov. Kim Reynolds created the task force, modeled after the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) program in the Trump administration, to seek government cost-cutting and efficiency measures at the state and local levels.

This proposal has sparked significant backlash from public worker groups and others, who have rallied using the slogan “Hands off IPERS” while urging supporters to contact Reynolds and lawmakers to voice their opposition to the recommendation.
Since the DOGE task force meeting, several Republican lawmakers have made posts on social media stating it is unlikely the Republican trifecta will pursue changes to the public retirement system in the upcoming legislative session.
Rep. Steve Holt, R-Denison, wrote in a Facebook post Saturday Republicans are committed to finding “innovative ways to make government smaller and smarter” — but this work will likely not involve modifying IPERS.
“I have discussed this issue with the House Speaker and other legislators,” Holt wrote. “While I recognize concerns about IPERS, I want to reassure Iowans that there is virtually no interest in making changes to it. We have one of the best funded retirement systems in the country.”
A handful of other House Republicans, including Reps. Tom Jeneary of Le Mars, Jason Gearhart of Strawberry Point and Mark Thompson of Clarion, made social media posts, saying they had received questions about the task force’s IPERS recommendation and wanted to reassure constituents the Legislature was unlikely to take up the issue.
Though several Republicans have voiced opposition to the proposal, several Democrats have called for Iowans who oppose the cuts to speak out in support of government employees. Rep. Molly Buck, D-Ankeny, wrote on Thursday this means contacting lawmakers and joining advocacy groups, as well as voting “for candidates who will protect retirement security.”
Iowa Auditor Rob Sand, who is running as a Democratic candidate for governor in 2026, criticized the proposal in a statement, saying the best way to make government more efficient was to “restore the State Auditor’s power to find misspent money,” not make changes to IPERS.
“Police officers, firefighters, teachers, plow drivers, and more paid into IPERS and should be thanked for their service,” Sand said. “They take salaries lower than typical private sector salaries, some because of the promise of IPERS. This proposal could result in reductions of retirement benefits that these workers have already paid into for years. Weakening IPERS will stop many people from taking public service jobs, leaving the public worse off and more key roles unfilled.”
Sen. David Sires of Cedar Falls wrote on Saturday there was “misinformation” being spread about changes to IPERS by Democrats. The recommendation — which would have to be approved by the legislature — would only impact new employees, and “there is very little interest in the legislature to take up this idea at all.”
“Claims that Republicans are attempting to ‘gut IPERS’ are simply false,” Sires wrote. “IPERS remains strong and will continue to serve the thousands of Iowans who depend on it.”
Though the recommendation was discussed in a public meeting earlier in August, the DOGE task force has not officially recommended changes to IPERS to Reynolds and lawmakers yet. The task force is scheduled to meet again on Sept. 24 before submitting its final report.

The deceased man’s daughter has been pressing for months for a more thorough investigation into her father’s death, challenging earlier findings that he died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

Vermont State Police have taken over from the Northfield Police Department the investigation into the death of a 68-year-old man, later ruled a suicide, that the man’s daughter believes was suspicious.
For the past several months, Alexandria Stanley has been pushing for a law enforcement agency outside of Northfield police to conduct an independent investigation into the death of her father, Pedro “Pete” Baez. 
She has disputed the findings by the police and the Vermont’s Chief Medical Examiner’s Office that her father died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in November 2024 at his home in Northfield.
Stanley said Monday that she was heartened by the news that state police would be taking over the investigation. 
“I’m hugely thankful that this will be looked at anew,” Stanley said. “I’ve been asking for an unbiased, independent investigation into my father’s suspicious death since November.” 
A detective from the state police major crime unit has been assigned to conduct an external review of the Pedro Baez death investigation carried out by the Northfield Police Department, according to an email that State Police Detective Lt. Tyson Kinney wrote to attorney Christina Nolan, who represents Stanley, on Friday
On Monday afternoon, state police announced they had “assumed the lead role in 
investigating” Baez’s death. 
Detectives from the state police major crime unit will work with the Washington County State’s Attorney’s Office, the Vermont Chief Medical Examiner’s Office, and the Northfield Police Department, “which initially was the primary investigative agency” on the case, according to a statement from state police. 
“Members of the state police will interview witnesses, gather facts and review evidence before presenting a complete investigative file to the state’s attorney for review,” the statement added. “The State’s Attorney’s Office will make a final determination on whether to file charges.”
State police did not respond to a question from VTDigger about what prompted its action. State police had previously declined attempts by Stanley seeking to have them take a lead role in the investigation.
“VSP is unable to comment further on this investigation while it is open and active,” the statement Monday from state police read.
Northfield Police Chief Pierre Gomez could not be reached Monday for comment. 
Michelle Donnelly, Washington County’s state’s attorney, said Monday that she would work with the state police as the investigation progresses.
The move by state police comes days after Peter Baez, 41, of Northfield, who is Stanley’s brother and Pedro Baez’s son, was arraigned Thursday in U.S. District Court in Burlington on federal charges of possessing and stealing guns from his late father’s estate about a month after his father’s death.
Peter Baez pleaded not guilty to the two criminal charges and was released on conditions. 
At that hearing, Assistant U.S. Attorney Michelle Arra said that shortly before his death, Baez had removed his son from the will and made Stanley the beneficiary.
Attorney William A. Vasiliou II, representing Baez, said after the hearing that his client “had nothing to do with the death of his father.”
Vasiliou could not be reached for further comment Monday afternoon.
Nolan, Vermont’s former U.S. attorney who represents Stanley, had written an email in April to law enforcement officials, as well as state and local leaders, seeking further investigation into Pedro Baez’s death. Nolan cited several problems she saw in the probe that led to the suicide, including that no autopsy took place and that Northfield police relied heavily on information by Peter Baez, who was living with his father at that time.
Berlin police later conducted a review of Northfield Police Department’s death investigation. In a report in April obtained by VTDigger, the investigator from Berlin police stated there were issues that warranted further investigation.
The report found that there were “inadequate” photographs taken at the residence, particularly of the father’s deceased body. The recommendations for further investigation listed in the report included obtaining financial records from Pedro and Peter Baez, medical records for Pedro Baez, as well as contacting service providers to preserve any internet, social media and cellphone records of the parties.
The report also recommended that an interview be conducted with Pedro Baez’s neighbor about his mental state at the time leading up to his death.
Stanley said Monday that she looked forward to finding out what the state police probe reveals. 
“My father lived the last 40 years of his life in the town of Northfield,” she said. “He deserves the dignity of a competent police investigation.”

While the state has invested heavily in fiber for internet connectivity, the state's broadband office director said told a legislative committee Monday that satellite internet could be a ""significant"" part of the puzzle as it seeks 100% connectivity. (Photo courtesy Jeff Lopez's legislative presentation)Even with federal changes to a huge funding stream for New Mexico, 90% of the state has access to high-speed internet, and contracts will be in place for the last 10% by the end of next year, the new leader of a state broadband office said Monday. 
And to get over the finish line, satellite internet is a “significant part of the picture,” said Jeff Lopez, who is beginning his eighth week in charge of the New Mexico Broadband Access and Expansion Office. Lopez was speaking to state lawmakers on the interim Economic and Rural Development committee. 
“We are still ‘fiber first,” Lopez said. “We’re focusing on areas that are financially prudent for that fiber connectivity, but low-Earth orbit satellites are going to be part of the picture, again, of meeting that commitment by the end of 2026.”
Roughly 90,000 New Mexico locations are “unserved” or “underserved” in terms of broadband access, according to Lopez’s presentation. “Unserved” households have download speeds of less than 25 megabits a second, while “underserved” have download speeds between 25 megabits a second and 100 megabits a second. A household of four with a 100-megabit download speed could stream videos, work remotely and have video calls like for telemedicine, “but not necessarily all at once,” Lopez said. 
NM Legislative Recap March 4: $70M request, likely headed to Musk’s Starlink, ‘probably dead’

The extent to which New Mexico’s internet connectivity plans include satellite, has been an open question amid federal changes to an infrastructure spending bill passed during President Joe Biden’s term.
Also, during the legislative session earlier this year, as Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency was firing federal workers and dismantling  federal programs, state lawmakers removed $70 million for satellite internet in the state budget that the previous broadband director said would likely have gone directly to Musk’s company satellite internet company Starlink. That funding cut does not affect the office’s timeline. 
Satellite internet companies can provide access in rural areas and those where overlapping jurisdictions or topographical features make it difficult and expensive to bury fiber lines Lopez said. But he also said fiber is “future proof” because it’s a largely permanent installation safely underground
“We still believe that [fiber] is the best connectivity that money can buy, but it’s often much more expensive than alternatives,” he said.
Satellite, on the other hand, is not as resilient to natural disasters, he said, and the technology isn’t “fully fleshed out yet.”
New Mexico Broadband Office wants $70M for satellite, high-speed internet

“It makes sense in areas with open skies, but we also have a lot of community communities along waterways and valleys, along bosques, whether it’s tree coverage or just a mesa or a mountain in the way, that can also impede some of the access,” he said. 
Biden’s infrastructure bill created the Broadband Equity Access and Deployment Program to oversee billions of dollars in internet connectivity spending. The state broadband office successfully qualified for $675 million of it and, Lopez said, was in the final steps last month of awarding sub-grantees the funding. 
But in early June, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration announced rule changes to the program that leaders said were aimed at reducing regulatory burdens and ensuring that all broadband technologies had equal footing when competing for the funds. 
The change toward “technology neutrality” meant the removal of “previous restrictions that favored fiber deployments,” according to a news release from the broadband office in early July. In addition to giving satellite a better shot at the funding, the rule change required all potential recipients of the funding to submit a new round of applications “regardless of where the state was in its sub-grantee selection process,” according to the news release. 
Two satellite companies have put in bids for the federal broadband  funding, Lopez said Monday. He declined to name which companies are seeking the funding.
“But you might be able to guess,” Lopez told lawmakers. 
According to the state Broadband Office’s application page for the federal money, SpaceX, which provides Starlink, is one of a handful of “prequalified applicants” that provides internet access. It appears to be the only satellite internet provider on the list.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screen-Shot-2025-08-11-at-4.25.57-PM-1024x556.png,,,2025-08-11 18:56:47.945606

Wildfires are supposed to be less common in the summer, when the state is usually lush and green, but they appear to be popping up more frequently, the state forest fire supervisor said.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont reaches ‘very high’ fire risk amid hot, dry conditions.","Map via Vermont Agency of Natural Resources
Most of the state was under a “very high” fire risk warning as of Monday due to dry conditions, according to Vermont Emergency Management. 
Only the central portion of the southern end of the state, including eastern Rutland and Bennington counties, and western Windsor and Windham counties, were under a lower-level “high” risk, the department wrote in a Facebook post. It warned Vermonters to avoid open burning, exercise caution with outdoor grills, campfires and machinery, and properly extinguish cigarettes. 
Megan Davin, a spokesperson for the Department of Forests, Parks and Recreation, said three “very high” fire warnings had been issued so far in 2025. Meanwhile, there were 13 overall in 2024 and 13 in 2023. 
Dan Dillner, the state forest fire supervisor, said the current conditions were abnormal compared to the past 20 years. “I don’t know what normal is anymore,” he said. 
Wildfires are supposed to be less common in the summer, when the state is usually lush and green, but they appear to be popping up more frequently, he said. In July, the state spent weeks fighting an 11-acre wildfire in Fair Haven. The last time a wildfire of that size had broken out in July was in 1988.
He urged Vermonters to follow safe fire practices. Along with avoiding open burns, anyone lighting a grill or campfire should keep it away from vegetation, monitor the embers and make sure it’s always attended. People also should be careful with cigarettes and other small burning items. 
“When you get to ‘very high’ fire danger, even flicking a cigarette into brush can cause a fire,” he said. 
Forty-five wildfires have been reported in Vermont so far this year, totaling 46 acres of damage. One was attributed to a lightning strike. The rest? Human-caused. 
“We in the Northeast need to remember our Smokey the Bear,” the famous mascot for fire safety, he said.  
The alert came as the state entered a new phase of hotter temperatures in an already hotter-than-average summer. The National Weather Service issued a heat advisory for Chittenden, Franklin, Grand Isle and western Addison counties for Monday and Tuesday. Burlington is expected to reach temperatures in the mid-90s on both days, the weather service said. 
The Vermont Department of Health maintains a list of cooling centers across the state and tips on staying safe in the heat on its website. 
Recent days have also seen less rain than expected for this time of year. Burlington has received 6 inches of rain in total since June 1, the start of meteorological summer. By contrast, the average rainfall during that time between 1990 and 2020 was over 9 inches. 
Roughly three-quarters of Vermont has been reported to have “abnormally dry” conditions by the U.S. Drought Monitor, a research project from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Less than two weeks after authorities say a state trooper killed his ex-girlfriend and her new boyfriend in a jealous rage, a New Jersey lawmaker is calling for passage of a bipartisan bill that would expand the definition of domestic violence to include psychological abuse.
Assemblywoman Aura Dunn (R-Morris) conceded in a statement that it’s unknown if a change in the law would have saved the victims — Lauren Semanchik and Tyler Webb — but Dunn added that the Legislature is “obligated to act and act swiftly.”
“This young woman feared for her safety and the system failed her in the worst way,” Dunn said.
Authorities believe Ricardo Jorge Santos, a lieutenant with the New Jersey State Police, shot Semanchik and Webb at Semanchik’s Franklin Township home and then took his own life in Piscataway (the victims’ bodies were found Aug. 2). Semanchik’s family has said she feared for her safety after ending her relationship with Santos and tried to get Franklin police involved but officers did not help her. Last week, the Hunterdon County Prosecutor’s Office took over control of the Franklin Township Police Department, saying the murder investigation “raised serious concerns about FTPD’s operations and effectiveness.”
Dunn’s bill aims to add psychological and economic abuse to the legal definition of domestic violence. She introduced it in January 2024 with Assemblywoman Lisa Swain (D-Bergen).
“Psychological abuse isn’t currently included in the definition of domestic violence, but it can be just as damaging as any physical assault and needs to be taken just as seriously. It is often the precursor to a violent incident,” Dunn said.
The Legislature is on a summer recess and will likely not reconvene until after November’s election, when all 80 Assembly seats are on the ballot.

Max Misch, a Bennington white supremacist, was sentenced Monday to two weeks in jail on charges of possessing high-capacity gun magazines. The court also made incremental progress toward his upcoming court dates involving kidnapping and assault charges.Misch’s sentencing took all of 10 minutes, with the state’s co-counsel Franklin Paulino requesting that Misch receive 14 to 15 days in jail. Misch’s lawyer, Frederick C. Bragdon did not push back, stating that he and his client agreed to the state’s terms. 
The case, which has been ongoing for roughly six years, tested a 2018 state law regulating high capacity magazines.

When Judge Jennifer Barrett gave Misch the opportunity to address the court following his sentencing, Misch appeared relatively at peace with the decision.“I think it’s a fair punishment for the crime. I think it fits the crime,” Misch said, though adding that he didn’t think his actions were a crime. “… I don’t agree with this law, but it is what it is. One day, I will be vindicated and that’s that. That’s all I have to say.”
Misch first gained state and national attention following his racial harassment of Kiah Morris, a former state representative for Bennington and the only Black woman to serve in Vermont’s House of Representatives.Barrett stated that Misch would have to be held without bail on the remaining kidnapping and assault charges until the defense had an actionable release plan. Barett also scheduled a check-in on Misch’s upcoming case for Sept. 10.

(Photo provided by Mullins McLeod)A Charleston lawyer is the first Democrat to officially launch a campaign for governor ahead of the 2026 election cycle.
Mullins McLeod, a 53-year-old attorney who was among the lawyers that helped negotiate an $88 million settlement for victims of the 2015 shooting at Mother Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, launched a bid for the Governor’s Mansion with a three-minute YouTube video Monday.
McLeod told the SC Daily Gazette, if elected, he would push back on the large incentive packages used to lure companies to the state. He did not name any specific deal he opposed.
And he joined in the chorus of Republican candidates calling for eliminating the state’s personal income tax — a major source of revenue for state spending. Income taxes are expected to provide more than $6.5 billion this fiscal year. Zeroing that out would slash 45% of the state’s general fund. At the same time, he wants to almost double teachers’ salaries.
“I believe there is a job that needs to be done and needs to be done now. That job is curing a cancer that has infiltrated our state government over the last 25 years,” McLeod said in the campaign video.
That cancer, according to McLeod, is “corruption” and state lawmakers bowing to corporations that have lobbied to “rig the system for their own financial gains.”
Though he doesn’t say it, the 25 years refers to how long Republicans have controlled both chambers in the Statehouse. After the 2000 elections, the party-switching of a single Democrat gave the GOP control of the Senate. The last Democrat in the Governor’s Mansion left office in January 2003.
In his campaign video, however, McLeod doesn’t call himself a Democrat of Republican. Nor does he mention either party.
“What I believe makes South Carolina great is the people that go to work everyday,” McLeod told the Daily Gazette. “And giving people’s hard earned tax dollars to large, for-profit corporations, that’s just disrespectful.”
“Public money should only be used for the public good,” McLeod added.
The personal injury attorney will need to overcome headlines of his arrest three months ago.
In May, McLeod was charged with disorderly conduct in downtown Charleston near the Battery, according to reporting by The Post and Courier. Officers said McLeod was wearing nothing but underwear and shoes and “yelling at the top of his lungs.” McLeod’s lawyer told a judge the erratic behavior stemmed from a mental health episode and exhaustion, the newspaper reported.
McLeod acknowledged the arrest but declined to comment Monday on the pending case, other than to say, “I was not in my underwear.”
He will explain, just not yet: “Long before voters go to the polls, they will know what happened,” he said.
A copy of the police report was not immediately available. The police department required the SC Daily Gazette to submit a request for the report under the Freedom of Information Act.
Meanwhile, Rep. Jermaine Johnson, D-Columbia, said he is still in the exploratory stage of a run for governor.
SC House Democrat says he’s exploring run for governor

“I believe South Carolina deserves leaders who are steady, consistent, and committed to the work, not just in an election year, but every single day,” Johnson said in a statement. “Until my decision is made, I’ll continue doing what I’ve always done: putting in the work for the people who sent me to Columbia and for the future of our great state.”
Johnson added that his decision on whether or not to run “will not be based on anyone else’s intention to seek the seat.”
On the Republican side, five candidates are vying for the party’s nomination.
McLeod, the nephew of former state Rep. Walt McLeod, D-Little Mountain, and the late state Sen. Peden Brown McLeod, D-Walterboro, previously ran for governor in 2010. He dropped out of that race ahead of the Democratic primary, endorsing former state Sen. Vincent Sheheen, D-Camden.
Sheheen ultimately lost the governor’s race to Nikki Haley.
Now, McLeod is back.
In addition to criticizing the state’s economic development incentives, he wants to rein in county-level property tax breaks for major manufacturers. While property tax decisions are made by local officials and do not affect the state budget, McLeod said all of it should be examined.
He also called out a portion of the massive energy package passed by the Legislature in May.
The section of the bill, known as rate stabilization, allows public utility companies to raise electric rates on an annual basis using a truncated review by state regulators rather than the full-blown rate process.
“I believe that’s corruption,” McLeod said.
McLeod, in his published platform, also said he will push for term limits, seek to make the cost of child care 100% tax deductible, and propose taxes for companies that use automation to reduce their workforce needs.
And there’s one business incentive he wants to add: He believes companies should get a tax credit for paying off their employees’ student loans.
As for teachers, he believes the state should pay them between $85,000 and $100,000.
Currently, teachers’ average salary statewide is about $62,000, though their pay depends on their years of experience and level of college degree.
That’s after legislators put $112 million into increasing teachers’ salaries this school year. That raised teachers’ minimum pay by $1,500 across the so-called salary schedule and brought the floor for first-year teachers to $48,500.
Raising that floor to $50,000 — as Gov. Henry McMaster recommended in his budget proposal — would have cost $200 million.
SC education officials ask legislators to raise teachers’ starting pay to $50K in 2025

Former state Rep. Bakari Sellers, who worked with McLeod on the Mother Emmanuel settlement, called McLeod a “forward-thinker and “one of the most accomplished trial lawyers in the state.”
The Bamberg County Democrat said McLeod will have to answer questions about the circumstances surrounding his arrest.
“It’s going to be a large hurdle,” Sellers said. “But we should try not to judge people at the moments when they are at the bottom. I’m willing to give him that grace.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mcleod_15webp.jpg,,,2025-08-11 17:57:24.627960

(Getty Images)Last month, Congress revived and expanded the program that offered payments to people sickened by nuclear weapons testing, meaning Utah’s downwinders can again apply for compensation. 
For years, Intermountain’s Downwinder Clinic, located at the St. George Regional Hospital’s Cancer Center, has provided free help to downwinders — that includes education, health care assistance and help applying to receive payments through the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, or RECA. 
However, RECA expired in June 2024 after Congress failed to reauthorize it. 
In the 13 months after the program expired, the Downwinder Clinic was still working with eligible families to gather the documents needed to qualify for RECA payments. And last month, after Congress reauthorized RECA in its massive spending bill, downwinders who were just recently diagnosed with cancer or who didn’t know about the program are again eligible for compensation.

“We have been working with families during the 13 months the program was expired to help gather the documents they would need when RECA was reinstated. Now, we want people to know that the qualifying boundaries have expanded, as well as new applicants qualify for a larger compensation amount for the health issues they have encountered,” said Barlow.
RECA has been in place since 1990, but downwinders have long said it should be expanded. Despite studies suggesting the entire West was impacted by dangerous levels of radiation during nuclear tests, downwinders in just 10 counties in Utah, as well as a handful of counties in Nevada and Arizona, were covered. 
Now, the program’s scope is much broader. All of Utah is considered an affected area, meaning if you lived in the Beehive State for a period of 12 months between 1951 to 1962, and contracted a certain type of cancer, you are likely eligible for compensation. 
Eligible cancers include leukemia (but not chronic lymphocytic leukemia), multiple myeloma, lymphomas and cancers of the pharynx, small intestine, salivary gland, brain, stomach, urinary bladder, colon, thyroid, pancreas, breast, esophagus, bile ducts, liver, gall bladder, lung, and ovarian.
New applicants will also now receive $100,000 — the prior compensation amount was $50,000. However, that increase is not retroactive, meaning downwinders who already received payments are not eligible for the new amount.

Most of that group, 7.5 million, would lose Medicaid benefits.A single section of the law creating new work requirements for Medicaid recipients would result in 5.6 million people losing access to care, the CBO said.The law also creates new work requirements for SNAP participants and mandates that at least some states pay for a portion of the benefits. States had never been required to cover any share of the cost of SNAP benefits.The changes to work requirements will result in reduced participation in the program by about 2.4 million people, the CBO said in another analysis published Monday.The changes to state cost-share in SNAP will save the federal government about $41 billion from 2026 to 2034, CBO said. The agency expects states to pick up most, $35 billion, of that spending.But the new requirements for states would still likely lead to 300,000 people fewer accessing benefits monthly. The report considered state officials would choose from policy responses including cutting benefits, reducing eligibility or leaving the program altogether in response to the new cost-share.‘Stealing from working families’In a press release, a quartet of Democratic leaders in Congress highlighted the regressive impact the CBO projected.“Prices keep rising and American families are struggling,” House Budget Committee ranking Democrat Brendan Boyle of Pennsylvania said. “So what are President Trump’s Republicans doing to help? They passed a law that will make things worse by stealing from working families to give billionaires a tax break.”“It is truly unfathomable that Trump and Republicans in Congress are championing a bill that gives the top 10 percent $13,600 more per year – while the least affluent 10 percent will lose $1,200 per year,” Senate Budget ranking Democrat Jeff Merkley of Oregon said. “This is families lose, and billionaires win.”Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, both of New York, made similar statements in the release.",,,,2025-08-11 17:57:24.627960

(Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)Colorado’s four Democratic U.S. House members visited an immigration detention center in Aurora on Monday morning and said many of their questions to facility staff went unanswered, a departure from previous tours of the site.
“This has been the most difficult visit in terms of getting information, getting answers out of the facility and out of the employees and being obstructed from conducting a full oversight that I’ve had in over six years,” U.S. Rep. Jason Crow, who represents Aurora in Congress, told reporters following the visit.
“Transparency and oversight matter a lot, and we will not bow down from our constitutional obligation to do that duty,” he said.
It was the 10th time Crow has visited the Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility since 2019.

Crow attempted to visit the facility in July but was denied entry, prompting a lawsuit brought by Crow, Rep. Joe Neguse of Lafayette and other members of Congress over a new administration policy that requires at least a week’s notice to conduct an oversight visit to Department of Homeland Security facilities.
Federal law gives members of Congress the authority to conduct unannounced oversight visits of immigration detention facilities. The group of lawmakers gave the facility notice that they would visit following Crow’s unsuccessful trip last month.
“I’ve been in a lot of correctional facilities in my life, and if you have to give seven days’ notice, they clean up pretty good,” U.S. Rep. Diana DeGette, a Denver Democrat, said. “We were told that the people in there were told to clean up and to spiff up and to make things look good. I’d like to see what happens normally in that facility.”
Crow and DeGette, alongside Neguse and Rep. Brittany Pettersen of Jefferson County, toured the detention center but said it was on lockdown for a population count while they were inside. They said many of their questions, including about the percentage of the detained population with criminal convictions, went unanswered. They also noticed that detailed information about detainees’ legal rights were no longer displayed in spots they’d previously occupied, but the lawmakers did see posted information that “extol the values of self deportation,” according to Pettersen.
DeGette said she was able to speak with Jeanette Vizguerra, a prominent immigrant rights activist who has been detained at the facility since March and is the plaintiff in a lawsuit that challenges her detention. DeGette handed Vizguerra a physical copy of federal legislation she is running to give Vizguerra lawful residency in the country.
“She told me she is not going to stop fighting for immigrants’ rights, and so we’re going to keep up our oversight here,” DeGette said.
Another new policy implemented by DHS, DeGette said, requires a signed privacy notice before a member of Congress can meet with a detained constituent.
“It’s just another attempt to stop people from visiting their constituents,” she said.
ICE did not immediately return an email about that policy or about the Monday visit from the Democratic congressional delegation.
The Aurora facility, privately run by the GEO Group for ICE, is the only DHS immigration detention facility in Colorado. Documents obtained by the American Civil Liberties Union show that the federal government is eyeing at least six locations in the state for additional facilities.

Mohammed Hassan and Muhtasin Sadman were each charged with forging a signature on an absentee ballot application and forgery under Michigan’s election law, both felony offenses, as well as making a false statement in an application for an absentee ballot, a misdemeanor. 
Sadman is also facing two felony charges for attempting to vote as an unqualified elector. 
According to a timeline from WDIV Local 4, Nessel filed a petition for a special prosecutor to investigate allegations of election fraud against four members of city council and a former council member in March. 
Nessel spokesperson, Danny Wimmer, said the Prosecuting Attorney’s Coordinating Council placed the investigation in the hands of the Monroe County Prosecutor’s office on May 21, referring any questions to their office.
According to a report from the Detroit News, Nessel’s decision to seek a special prosecutor was based on the attorney general’s previous criticism of the Hamtramck City Council’s anti-LGBTQ+ policies and Nessel’s decision to prosecute pro-Palestinian protesters at the University of Michigan. Nessel is gay and Jewish, with the petition aimed to circumvent any allegations of bias against Muslim or Arab individuals, with one in five suspects of Arab descent.

(Photo by Shalina Chatlani/ Stateline)At least 12 states have received federal approval to restrict recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, from using their benefits to purchase certain foods such as soda and candy.
The states receiving waivers from the U.S. Department of Agriculture are overwhelmingly Republican. Colorado, Florida, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Texas and West Virginia received approval last week. The feds granted waivers to Arkansas, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Nebraska and Utah earlier this year.
SNAP served on average nearly 42 million people a month in fiscal 2024, with about 12% of the U.S. population receiving benefits.
GOP cuts to food assistance would hit rural America especially hard

The trend is part of U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s agenda to “make America healthy again” by inviting states to apply for waivers to change SNAP rules to limit what types of food recipients can buy.
Kennedy said in a statement that SNAP has used taxpayer dollars to “fuel America’s diabetes and chronic disease epidemics.”
“These waivers help put real food back at the center of the program and empower states to lead the charge in protecting public health,” the statement said.
Critics of these waivers say the policy could harm people in places such as food deserts, where healthy options are limited, and take away recipients’ power to make their own food choices.
Craig Gundersen, a professor in the Department of Economics at Baylor University, told Stateline that these changes could harm the integrity of the program.
“One of the main reasons why SNAP is such a successful program is because it gives dignity and autonomy to recipients. It gives dignity to recipients by allowing them to shop in the same manner as their neighbors, friends and family, and it gives autonomy to recipients by saying to families: You are the best ones to make decisions for your families about what to purchase,” Gundersen said.
Gundersen said he worries the restrictions could stigmatize SNAP, which he called one of the best programs for fighting food insecurity.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Florida Power & Light has reached an 11th-hour “agreement in principle” with parties objecting to its proposed four-year, $10 billion rate increase, but the details remain undisclosed.
The investor-owned utility made the announcement Friday, just three days before the Public Service Commission was scheduled to begin a hearing on the the proposed rate hike.
The utility giant said the agreement would be finalized and made public by Aug. 20. The yet-to-be-announced-rates must still be approved by the PSC.
FPL released a statement announcing that the rate settlement “would keep customer bills well below the national average through the end of the decade.”
“We are pleased to have reached an agreement in principle with key stakeholders. A settlement would provide a win for our customers and the state of Florida. We appreciate the constructive engagement of key intervenors,” FPL CEO Armando Pimentel said in a news release.
The company announced that the settlement was supported by 10 groups of heavy power users, including the business-friendly Florida Retail Federation, and consumer advocate groups like the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy.
During Monday’s PSC hearing, initially set to hear from parties to the rate-setting procedure, but diverted in light of the provisional settlement, critics targeted the proposed rate increase as the product of “corporate greed.”

Zayne Smith, senior director for advocacy at AARP Florida, said she still opposes the agreed-upon rates and criticized that the settlement wasn’t publicly available for review.
“It actually doesn’t give much hope at all, because the settlement totally eviscerates any transparency and accountability rate payers like you and me and anyone watching this from their homes have when it comes to decisions that are being made on our behalf,” Smith said Monday before the PSC met. 
Smith said seniors and others on fixed incomes will be hit hardest by the increase, arguing a $5-$15 increase on power bills could be the difference between being able to buy groceries or gas for the month. 
AARP Florida delivered 34,000 signed petitions opposing the increase to the PSC meeting on Monday. Of those, 12,000 were mailed in and 22,000 were completed online.
“This is the perfect signal to our legislative body that reform at the public service commission is necessary,” Smith said. She wants the Legislature to revisit the issue, noting that Sen. Don Gaetz filed  SB 354, during the 2025 session but that it never attracted a House sponsor. 
That proposal aimed to increase transparency and hold utility companies more accountable for how they set rates.
FPL’s initial proposal would have increased by 2029 what the “typical” FPL customer in Florida would pay by up to $18 per month, according to the company.
FPL serves more than 6 million accounts and 12 million people in Florida. It’s parent company, NextEra Energy, is Florida-based and publicly traded.
The agreement, Smith said, should be the “perfect catalyst” for legislators to start a conversation on changing the process next year.
“Any agreement that we reach should enable FPL to continue to make smart investments on behalf of our customers, ensuring that we can continue to provide reliable electricity to power our fast-growing state while keeping customer bills low,” Pimentel said.

(Photo courtesy of Justine Wilson)When Siri Fiske founded the Mysa Microschool in Washington, D.C., in 2016, there wasn’t a widely accepted term for her small, one-room schoolhouse model.
Now, the school is referred to on its website as one of the first microschools in the nation, and Fiske has seen a growing microschool movement since the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the five years since remote schooling amid pandemic-era lockdowns, microschools and homeschooling have emerged as increasingly popular alternatives to traditional public and private models. Smaller class sizes, individualized classrooms and lack of standardization are an appeal to parents, Fiske said.
“There’s this idea that people who open microschools are doing it for cultish or religious reasons, and there’s a misconception that all are like that,” Fiske said. “I’ve seen my students graduate into top colleges. There’s many ways to achieve academic success.”
Some education experts, however, have expressed concern about the growing movement. They question whether microschools are properly regulated and being held accountable, and whether they’ll pull dollars out of the public education system.
There is no federal definition of a microschool, and with the Trump administration’s plans to shutter the U.S. Department of Education, the onus is on states to figure them out. 










Schools calling themselves microschools today are not what I would’ve called one back then. But I think that’s OK. It’s evolving.


– Siri Fiske, founder and head of Mysa School


In some states, microschools face a bind: If they operate as private schools, they’re required to meet facility, staffing and curricular standards that are often cost-prohibitive for schools their size. If they operate under homeschool laws, they face oversight, assessment mandates and reporting requirements that aren’t designed for multifamily or educator-led models.
Some states, including Georgia, Tennessee and Texas, have passed “Learning Rights Protection Acts” to codify microschools’ right to operate.
In Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts and Oregon, learning pods and microschools often face child care or private school licensing requirements if they involve multiple families, hire instructors or provide compensation for child care.
“Schools calling themselves microschools today are not what I would’ve called one back then. But I think that’s OK. It’s evolving,” Fiske said.
She pointed to the national school choice movement — and states such as West Virginia — for helping the microschool movement flourish.
In 2022, West Virginia became one of the few states to define a microschool, distinctly separating it from a private school, homeschool or learning pod.
Those classifications, and how these schools are funded and regulated, affect everything from whether a school must hire certified teachers to how it ensures student safety or civil rights protections. And with more public dollars flowing to private or hybrid learning options through vouchers and education savings accounts — to the detriment of public school funding, some argue — states will need to define these schools and their place in the ecosystem.
States will have to fill the gaps, said Weadé James, senior director of K-12 education policy with the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning policy think tank.
“Accountability can vary wildly. Some microschools aren’t required to have certified teachers, conduct annual assessments, or even guarantee civil rights protections,” said James. “If public voucher dollars are going to a microschool, there has to be some level of oversight and accountability.”
Many microschools aren’t accredited
Microschools defy easy classification, and many advocates argue that’s by design. Don Soifer, CEO of the National Microschooling Center, an industry group, cautions lawmakers against rushing to impose fixed legal definitions.
“Innovation is happening too fast. The moment you define it in law, it becomes obsolete,” Soifer said.
New federal school voucher program poses a quandary for states: Opt in or opt out?

A 2024 sector analysis by the National Microschooling Center — one of the only sources of national data on the topic — found that many schools are operating outside traditional education principles.
In a survey of 400 microschools across 41 states, more than 60% of founders reported they were not currently licensed educators. Eighty-four percent reported their schools were not accredited. Among prospective founders, 48% are licensed educators (though only 14% currently work in public schools), 32% come from non-education fields, and 23% are parents building schools for their own children.
Most microschools (55%) operate under homeschool laws, while others function as private schools (37%), charters (6%) or fall into unique state categories (3%), according to the analysis.
“So, you can be a private or homeschool microschool program, where you aren’t required to provide students with certified teachers, or you aren’t required to conduct annual assessments,” James said.
Often described as “homeschool hybrids” or “small-scale learning communities,” microschools often serve around 16 students or fewer, and tend to cater to families with average or above-average incomes in their area. In some states, microschools have been authorized to receive public funds through voucher programs.
Some critics note that, like private schools, microschools may charge tuition, potentially excluding lower-income families and contributing to educational disparities.
These schools often operate in commercial spaces (41%), private residences (28%) or houses of worship (25%), according to the National Microschooling Center. The center also found the movement is diversifying: 37% of prospective founders are people of color, compared with 27% of current operators.
Because building and zoning codes vary from state to state and locality to locality, many operators may be unaware of the extra costs to meet school codes standards. Fiske recalls difficulties in expanding from Washington, D.C., to Vermont, which has stricter laws on water fountain requirements.
“Most people in the U.S. starting a microschool are doing it under the radar because the regulations to open a licensed school are so intense,” Fiske said. For the new school, she recalled, “it took us forever, and we had to install ADA-compliant toilets and water fountains for just 10 kids in Vermont.”
‘Microschooling is not one thing’
Microschools also operate in a legal gray zone, often outside the traditional K-12 system and subject to a patchwork of state and local policies that can either support or constrain their growth.
Growth has accelerated in conservative-leaning states with robust school choice programs, such as Arizona and Florida. Other states, such as Maryland, New York and North Dakota, have more restrictive homeschool or private school laws.
“Microschooling is not one thing. These schools look different in every state, and the policy frameworks around them vary wildly,” said Soifer, of the National Microschooling Center.
What is classified as a microschool can vary from “10 kids in a basement in Kentucky” to a 200-kid schoolhouse elsewhere.
Public school enrollment continues to fall

Fiske said states need to create a way for operators and parents to know what to expect in a certain state, and help willing operators get the education and business acumen they need to run the schools successfully.
“But if you look at who is starting microschools in the U.S., it’s a lot of millennial parents who may not have any teacher training but wanted to create a learning environment for their children and others in the local community,” said Fiske. “And without efforts by the state to provide some incentives to earn accreditation and information as both a school and a small business, a few of these will find themselves going under.”
Seeking choices
After two decades working in conventional schools in the United States and around the world — including in Brazil, Egypt and Qatar — Justine Wilson turned down a high-paying leadership role at a prestigious private school. Instead, in 2023 she opened Curious and Kind Education, a two-day-a-week microschool in Sarasota, Florida, built around trust, nature-based learning and self-directed play.
Enrollment at Curious and Kind is mostly driven by word of mouth, she said. The program now has a waitlist. And Wilson has seen her enrollment grow from 18 students in her first year to roughly 100 students for the upcoming school year.
“The number of 5-year-olds on my waitlist is shocking,” she said, “and then I realized they’re COVID babies and their parents have really been driving this search for alternative schooling since the pandemic.”
James, of the Center for American Progress, questions whether microschools generally match the quality of traditional public schools, which still educate more than 80% of schoolchildren. She says families may be under the assumption that school choice options equate to better quality.
“We have created an illusion of choice to be quality, and I think a lot of families are seeking various choice options because they associate that with quality. But that doesn’t necessarily mean that where those students are going is any better than where they left,” she said.
“We need to take a closer look at what we are presenting to families,” James said. “It’s not just about having options and having a choice. It’s about having quality choice options.”
That quality, Soifer said, is what microschools are trying to achieve.
“Microschools do very well on the left, on the right … at the top end of the economy and at the fragile end of the income spectrum,” he said. “It’s really a matter of the new economy and a new way of thinking about education.”

Kate Lewton is a reporter with the Community News Service, part of the University of Vermont’s Reporting & Documentary Storytelling program.
BURLINGTON — They are made up of cabins scrawled with old camp signatures, wide lawns, friendship bracelets, campfires, lake games, tearful partings and general childhood delight. Summer camps have been the launching ground for life lessons for decades of American kids, but the latest threat to preserving that magic could be climate change. 
In light of the recent flooding at Camp Mystic in Texas, dangerous weather presents a very real threat. Now, Vermont summer camps are working to learn from the tragedy to better ensure camper safety.
Summer weather has been big news in recent years, and locals have taken notice. Scott Whittier, the warning coordination meteorologist in Burlington for the National Weather Service, said that the most noticeable change is the variations and persistencies of weather extremes.
In past Vermont summers people might experience higher heat days, Whittier said, but typically a cold front would follow to provide some relief. However, within the last five to 10 years,  periods of high heat last longer. On June 22, Burlington reached 99 degrees, the fourth-highest temperature on record for the city in history. 
A warmer atmosphere can hold 4% more water vapor for every one degree Fahrenheit of increased temperatures, according to Whittier.
“If we’re continuing to have a climate that is warmer and warmer, that gives us more potential for more water in the atmosphere to eventually rain down,” Whittier said. That means heavier rain events.
Over the course of the last half-century, annual precipitation in Vermont has increased about 20%, according to Whittier. But the frequency of heavy rainfall events up to 4 inches have seen a 200% increase. Vermont is seeing more heavy rainfall episodes, and in between those episodes, drier, hotter periods that last longer.  
The American Camp Association, a membership organization that has accredited more than 3,500 overnight summer camps, plays a crucial role in promoting safety precautions to camps certified in its network.
While Camp Mystic was not ACA accredited, the organization released a statement in regard to the tragedy and the aftershocks it sent through the camp world. 
“In times like these, the loss of even one life touches every camp, because the camp community is and has always been deeply interconnected,” said the ACA in an online statement . “We stand together in sorrow, in solidarity and in support.” 
This ACA statement said it was working as a resource to support those impacted by the tragedy and to provide camps with more resources to listen to local needs.
Michele Rowcliffe, executive director of the ACA’s New England office, spoke to Community News Service prior to the tragedy at Camp Mystic about the work being done to combat the changing climate in the camp world. Prior to the event, Rowcliffe said the shifting environment is something camp professionals are taking seriously. 
“It has been a heightened conversation. I’d say camping is a really resilient and flexible industry. I think that camps and camping professionals are super nimble,” Rowcliffe said. “As part of licensing, as part of accreditation, having emergency action plans are required. So there’s always a plan A, a plan B, a plan C.”
Even with the shifting environment, Rowcliffe reiterated the important transformative experiences that summer camps provide youth. 
“While the world changes so fast, there are some of these traditions of camping that haven’t changed, and it’s basically working together, learning group work, learning conflict resolution, making decisions without a parent or caregiver being there, being out in nature,” Rowcliffe said.
While flooding is at the forefront of everyone’s mind, high heat can also pose a potentially dangerous threat to campers if not properly prepared for. Hosmer Point, in the Northeast Kingdom, and Camp Farewell, in Newbury, are both ACA-accredited camps pivoting their programming under climate change.
Hosmer Point Camp Director Carrie Glessner said she expected the ACA to release new guidelines for all accredited camps later this summer. But, while flooding is an issue Hosmer Point was aware of at other camps, its location meant it wasn’t an issue on their property, Glessner said. 
“Hosmer Point is on a hilltop, and although our cabins are next to Great Hosmer Pond, the pond itself is at the top of the watershed — no rivers drain into it — so there is no appreciable flood risk at our site,” Glessner said. 
But after the floods in 2023 and 2024, though Great Hosmer Pond was unaffected, the camp realized that if local roads were closed, they needed emergency routes off the property. Glessner said more food is now kept on the property in case of delivery delays. 
Glessner says the biggest issue for the camp is frequent thunderstorms because their location on a hill puts them at greater risk for lightning strikes. This threat, mixed with unpleasant weather, means camp activities must be moved inside. 
“We’ve been investing more time and budget on indoor activities to improve that area of our programming, but it’s still a challenge for staff to bring the enthusiasm if we have multiple days in a row of thunderstorms,” Glessner said. “We have a detailed protocol for thunderstorms — when to keep biking and boating trips near shelter and when to bring everyone indoors.”
At Camp Farewell, which also wasn’t affected by flooding in 2023 or 2024, directors Rachel Morgan and Marley Hansensaid the camp is learning to prepare and pivot in the event of heavy rainfall. 
“We always have our staff plan for the fact that we know we’re gonna have rainy days so they go into the summer having rainy day plans,” Morgan said. “We keep going as much as we can, but obviously safety comes first. But we’re resilient.”
The same flexibility is essential when the heat index turns dangerous. 
“For us, it means turning every activity possible into a water activity, not planning running-in-the-sun activities, lots of coolers of lemonade, making sure campers have bedding for hot weather and really doubling down on the reminders to drink water,” Glessner said. “There are more hot days now, but it doesn’t change what we do for them.” 
At Camp Farwell, altering activities like turning regular tennis into water balloon tennis helps cool down campers, or switching out baking classes with smoothie making. 
“Pivoting and making the best situation can be really positive and leave really great memories, especially when it’s impromptu and the kids haven’t experienced it before,” Hansen said. 
In the wake of tragedy and change, summer camps are looking toward the future.
“One thing that I’d want to point out is the resiliency, the flexibility, the loyalty and passion that folks have in this industry,” Rowcliffe said. “So many people have been in it for decades and we really believe in what we’re doing and making a difference in young people.”

(Photo by Izzy Wagener/Minnesota Reformer)After one of the most bitter contract campaigns in recent memory, members of the union representing some 18,000 state employees approved a two-year contract that largely maintains the status quo with modest pay increases.
Although voting, dues-paying members supported ratifying the contract by a wide margin — 6,857 to 1,813 — the Minnesota Association of Professional Employees said the 79% approval was the lowest since the union went on strike in 2001.
MAPE President Megan Dayton said in a news release on Friday that the relatively lackluster response to the contract was “an indictment on the anti-worker attacks from Gov. Tim Walz.”
Many MAPE members, who work in hundreds of different jobs from data analyst to social worker, have been fuming at Walz since he ordered state employees back to the office part time. Workers held protests outside the governor’s residence in St. Paul, and many said they’d be willing to strike over the directive.
The continued icy relations with a major public employee union — a key Democratic constituency — comes just weeks before Walz is expected to announce his re-election plans.
In the end, the union backed down and settled for a contract with no significant changes to the return-to-office policy that took effect June 1. One minor tweak: The state must provide 21 days notice for telework changes, up from 14 days.
“While this contract does not give us everything we deserve, especially on telework protections, it is a hard-fought foundation for future progress,” Dayton said.
It’s unclear how many MAPE members had telework arrangements. The union says state officials pleaded ignorance, although Walz has said about 60% of state employees worked in-person during the pandemic.
The union did claim victory in beating back state health care proposals that they estimated would raise workers’ costs by thousands of dollars a year.
Workers will receive a 1.5% raise in the first year of the contract and a 1.75% increase in the second along with seniority raises. The modest increases reflect the state’s cloudy budget forecast with a significant deficit on the horizon. If inflation matches projections — estimated to remain stubbornly elevated in the wake of President Trump’s import taxes — then workers’ raises might not keep up with the cost of living.
The union also beat back a proposal from the state to allow for “emergency layoffs” during epidemics, natural disasters and other “fiscal exigencies.” The new kind of layoff would have allowed the state to idle workers without having to follow the usual contractual procedures governing layoffs, like placing laid off workers in vacant positions at the same seniority level.
AFSCME Council 5, which represents another 18,000 state employees, announced a tentative agreement on the same day as MAPE in June but did not respond to inquiries about whether their members had ratified the agreement.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/P1230117-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-08-11 17:57:24.627960

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) Oat harvest is a week behind last year’s schedule and five days behind the average, according to the crop progress and condition report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
The first full week of August followed trends from July with above-average precipitation across the state, though Iowa crops continue to progress well. 
Overall 83% of the oat crop has been harvested. South-central Iowa has the highest percentage of acres harvested at 96% of its oat acres. 
Corn acres are about one day ahead of schedule with a reported 68% of acres having reached the dough stage, characterized by a doughy consistency inside the kernels. In about 15% of acres the corn has already dented, which is on par with the five-year average.

Soybeans are ahead of last year by two days, but behind normal by three, with 75% of acres having set pods and 93% of the crop blooming. 
More than 80% of both soybean and corn acres in the state rated good to excellent, according to the data collected by USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service. Hay and pasture conditions rated similarly for the reporting period of Aug. 4 through Aug. 10. 
Just 3% of alfalfa hay remains to be cut for the second time and half of alfalfa hay acres in the state have been cut for a third time. 
Heavy rainfall in western Iowa left farmers in the region just four days suitable for field work during the reporting period. Other regions had 5-6 days suitable for field work. 
Communities in western Iowa received more than 3 inches of rain during the past week, though Pacific Junction logged the state’s highest precipitation for the reporting period of 6.64 inches.
The average precipitation for the time frame was 1.6 inches, or six-tenths of an inch above the normal, according to State Climatologist Justin Glisan. 
“August’s first full week was unseasonably wet across western Iowa with drier conditions southeast,” Glisan said in the report. “A wet reporting period along with the 2nd wettest July on record aided in the removal of all remaining drought from Iowa.” 
Across the state, the majority of cropland, around 70%, has adequate topsoil and subsoil moisture conditions. North-central and central portions of the state have the highest percentages of soils with surplus moisture. Forty-eight percent of topsoil and 49% of subsoil rated surplus in north central Iowa. Central Iowa had 36% surplus moisture in topsoil and subsoil. 
According to the report, fields are beginning to dry following wetness from the past month, but some low spots still have some ponding.

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)The SUVs pulled up quickly outside of the Rhode Island Traffic Tribunal in Cranston around 10:30 in the morning on June 17. 
Pablo Grave de la Cruz, 36, had just left a hearing inside where he pleaded not guilty to a charge of refusal to submit to a chemical test after being involved in a one-car accident in Coventry. He was dressed for the occasion, in a collared shirt and slacks. He had plans to go out for breakfast.
He heard his name called. Moments later, a half dozen Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents — wearing masks and carrying guns — surrounded and handcuffed de la Cruz, then hustled him into one of the vehicles and drove away. Neither his lawyer nor his friend, Brittany Donohue, who had accompanied him, were allowed to go with him. 
“They pulled up on him like he was a murderer or a rapist,” Donohue said. “He was leaving traffic court.”
She was left trembling from the experience and had to wait another 20 minutes before she was calm enough to drive.
De la Cruz has lived in Rhode Island for 19 years and has been married to Sam Spadavecchia since 2016. The couple live in North Providence. De la Cruz came from Guatemala as a teenager illegally out of fear for his safety as a gay person around 2005 the same year Amnesty International wrote, “The LGBT community in Guatemala regularly faces attacks and threats.” Since then, he has worked as a server at two of Providence’s most recognizable restaurants — Los Andes and the Capital Grille — and spent time working or managing others. 
De la Cruz’s enthusiasm and deep menu knowledge made a favorable impression on customers and coworkers at the restaurants where he worked. The Yelp page for Los Andes still includes reviews that single out de la Cruz. “To say he was phenomenal would be an understatement,” one reads. Another advises guests to “ask for Pablo as your server – he was great!”
His arrest is one of a growing number by ICE agents at or around Rhode Island courthouses in recent months. The practice has alarmed advocates, state lawmakers — including two Providence Democrats, Rep. David Morales, and House Deputy Speaker Raymond Hull, who wrote letters of support to the judge in de la Cruz’s immigration case — and even the chief justice of the Rhode Island Supreme Court.. 
In February, agents arrested a Venezuelan man outside the Garrahy Judicial Complex in downtown Providence after he appeared at a hearing for domestic violence charges. 
In July, social worker Diego Tomas Arene-Morley filmed plainclothes officers arresting a woman from Ecuador he had just accompanied as his client to court in Providence. The woman had just had charges dismissed stemming from a domestic violence incident in which she was actually the victim. Video of the arrest, and Arene-Morley’s description of it, went viral on Instagram. The woman remains in ICE custody, Arene-Morley said.
Later in July, ICE agents arrested a Guatemalan man on Benefit Street in Providence right when he left Superior Court after appearing on charges of felony domestic assault and violating a protective order. He was charged with assaulting federal officers after an immigration officer and a DEA agent were injured during a scuffle, the U.S. Department of Justice said.

At least 15 arrests of undocumented immigrants have occurred outside Rhode Island courthouses since the beginning of Trump’s second term, including five outside the traffic court, said Juan Pablo Ocampo-Sheen, coordinator for the Immigration Coalition of Rhode Island. But that estimate is likely an undercount since the coalition doesn’t hear about every arrest, Ocampo Sheen said.
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the parent agency for ICE, says courthouse arrests make common sense because they save agents time locating people and offer protection since people they’re looking for have passed through courthouse security screening.
James Covington, a spokesperson for ICE’s Boston field office, said de la Cruz was sought because he had a criminal record.
“Pablo Grave-De La Cruz is an illegally present, 36-year-old Guatemalan alien,” Covington said in a statement. “His criminal history includes TWO convictions for driving while intoxicated, an additional motor vehicle charge and a pending charge for a THIRD DWI. Officers with ICE Boston arrested Grave-De La Cruz in Cranston, Rhode Island.” 
Records show de la Cruz was found guilty of a DUI in 2014 and pleaded no contest to another DUI charge in 2015. He was also cited once for driving without a license in 2010 and driving with a suspended license in 2016. He was charged with DUI and refusal to take a Breathalyzer after his car went off Fish Hill Road in Coventry on June 8, 2025. 
“Allowing this alien offender to remain on the streets of Rhode Island only places the safety of our neighbors in jeopardy,” Covington added in his statement. “ICE Boston will continue to prioritize public safety by arresting and removing criminal alien offenders.”
But courthouse arrests, Ocampo-Sheen said, could make it less likely that undocumented people or those in mixed-status households will report crimes or testify as victims, out of fear of deportation.  
Steven Brown, executive director of the Rhode Island ACLU said courthouse arrests are part of a broader pattern of ICE tactics, including masked agents and smashing car windows during arrests, intended to spread fear. He warns the ripple effects of such tactics could harm even those who support the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration agenda.
“It’s really a dangerous step to take to engage in what is clearly intimidation tactics to prevent people from making use of the judicial system,” Brown said.
“When you get into a car accident and the person who witnesses that you weren’t at fault is afraid to go to court to support your position, you might think twice about whether these actions are in fact in your best interest,” Brown said.
‘Only a matter of time’
The debate over ICE enforcement at Rhode Island courthouses goes back at least to the early months of President Donald Trump’s first term, in 2017, when more than a dozen local organizations sent a letter to Rhode Island Supreme Court Justice Paul Suttell expressing concern over ICE arrests at courthouses around the country.  The ACLU, the RI Coalition Against Domestic Violence, the Refugee Dream Center, NAACP, and other groups urged the justice to contact the then-Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly asking  that agents not conduct such arrests in Rhode Island. 
“We fear it is only a matter of time before it happens here,” they wrote. 
That prediction proved true. 
One month after the letter, ICE agents arrested a Syrian man outside of the Licht Judicial Complex. Abulkhalek Darwich, who had stayed nearly 20 years past the expiration of a guest visa issued in the late 1990s, was facing state charges for the illegal importation and sale of cigarettes. He was taken into custody by ICE following a court appearance in that case. (Later in 2019, Darwich was charged with multiple counts of child molestation and sexual assault.)
Darwich’s detention prompted an outcry from the Rhode Island ACLU, which said, in a statement, “There will be no equal access to justice in Rhode Island if residents are afraid to make use of their judicial system.” 
Suttell — who served as a Republican in the Rhode Island House of Representatives in the 1980s — spoke out too. 










They pulled up on him like he was a murderer or a rapist. He was leaving traffic court.

After Darwich’s arrest, Suttell acknowledged federal authorities had a duty to enforce immigration laws. “But at the same time, our courts need to be accessible to everyone, regardless of immigration status, whether they are a crime victim, a witness, someone seeking a protection order or someone simply looking to pay a court fine,” he said.
In 2020, Colorado and New York passed laws aimed at curbing ICE arrests at courthouses. A third bill passed in Washington that year required courts to document instances of federal law enforcement entering courts for non-court-related business and prohibiting judges, prosecutors, and court staff from collecting or sharing info about immigration statuses unless relevant to a state criminal offense. 
In 2021, the Biden administration issued a memo that acknowledged courthouse arrests “may chill individuals’ access to courthouses and, as a result, impair the fair administration of justice.” It encouraged agents to conduct them only in a narrow set of circumstances. That memo was rescinded on the day of Trump’s inauguration for his second term in January. Since that time, ICE has ramped up arrests in every state, including courthouse arrests. 
Even in states with laws or rules designed to stop courthouse arrests, the issue remains unsettled. In Colorado, following reports of ICE arrests in defiance of the state law, the state’s ACLU sent a letter to ICE and DHS demanding a stop to the practice. In New York, the Trump administration sued the state to challenge its law protecting against courthouse arrests. In Ohio, after judges in Franklin County passed rules prohibiting immigration arrests at courthouses, lawmakers introduced a bill that would nullify such policies across the state. 
Bills stall in Rhode Island
For the past three legislative sessions, Rhode Island lawmakers in both chambers have introduced legislation that would limit ICE’s ability to perform civil arrests. The latest versions of these bills — Senate Bill 0291 and House Bill 6121 — were introduced by Sen. Meghan Kallman, a Pawtucket Democrat, and Rep. Jose Batista, a Providence Democrat, during the 2025 legislative session.
Their bills wouldn’t have prohibited law enforcement officers from making an arrest at a courthouse if they have a warrant or if officers directly witness a crime. But the legislation sought to categorize civil arrests at courthouses as contempt of court and false imprisonment, and allow both the arrestee and the attorney general to sue for relief. 
Both bills were held for further study after committee hearings. And both lead sponsors say they intend to file the bills again in 2026. 
 “As a matter of practicality, our judicial system relies on all Rhode Islanders having free and fair access to the courts — whether as defendants, plaintiffs or witnesses — without fear of detention and deportation,” the sponsors wrote in a March opinion piece. 
Kallman said the bill is about protecting public safety.
“If the argument is that we want life to be safer for Rhode Islanders, then one of the ways that we need to do that is make the courts as safe as they possibly can be from outside interference,” she told Rhode Island Current.  “And outside interference, in this case, is ICE.”  
Kallman said she intends to submit legislation that would prohibit federal agents from conducting an arrest while masked.
Batista said he sees protecting immigrants’ basic rights as a moral imperative. “I feel like we’re literally living history, but in a bad way,” he said. “This bill is me embracing one of the few things I feel like I can do.”

Local efforts to mobilize
Absent local legislation or rules preventing ICE arrests at courthouses, some Rhode Islanders are working to disrupt enforcement on their own.  
In July, the Olneyville Neighborhood Association (ONA), Alliance to Mobilize Our Resistance (AMOR), and Rhode Island chapter of the Party for Socialism and Liberation (PSL)  launched a petition aimed at Gov. Dan McKee, Providence Mayor Brett Smiley, the Providence City Council, and Suttell. Calling ICE a “pandemic,” the petition demanded that courts across the state offer virtual hearings, trials, and conferences, “to all community members until they actually ensure real safety for our community members by banning ICE from the city.” 
On social media, PSL and AMOR have been posting regularly about what they believe to be ICE near local courthouses. One post from late July included footage of two men wearing face coverings, tactical vests, guns holstered to their thighs and metal badges affixed to their clothing, with the Garrahy Courthouse visible in the background. “We know we can’t rely on politicians and their empty promises,” the caption read. “We have to take matters into our own hands and get organized in huge numbers to make sure ICE does not take anybody else from the courthouses.”










It’s really a dangerous step to take to engage in what is clearly intimidation tactics to prevent people from making use of the judicial system.


– Steven Brown, executive director of the Rhode Island ACLU


Arnoldo Benitez, an immigration lawyer with an office in Providence, said he has had at least one client detained by ICE. 
Once a person is in ICE custody, it’s virtually impossible for them to participate in their state-level criminal proceedings, and so those local cases can remain open for years, Benitez said. If the person leaves the country, their still-pending criminal charges can make it difficult or impossible to come back legally. That’s a threat to due process, he explained. 
“There goes the presumption of innocence, there goes your right to confront accusers, there goes your right to stand trial,” Benitez said. “All of your constitutional rights are just gone because you are not afforded that opportunity to fight your case.”
Benitez is torn over what to tell his clients who are scared to go to court. He can’t advise them not to go. “I do have to warn them that there is a chance that ICE can be there and can detain you,” he said.
Moved without notice
Spadavecchia drove to ICE’s field office on Jefferson Boulevard in Warwick after de la Cruz’s arrest to try to see his husband but was denied. Instead, Spadavecchia was given a bag of de la Cruz’s belongings, including his wallet, phone, and wedding ring. 
De la Cruz was eventually transferred to the Wyatt Detention Facility in Central Falls, where he spent five days before being transferred, without notice, to a detention facility in South Texas around 20 miles from the U.S.-Mexico border. Spadavecchia learned his husband had been moved after it happened, via a phone call from de la Cruz. Before hearing from his husband, he had spent hours calling the Wyatt in search of his husband’s whereabouts. 
De la Cruz’s friends and family members spent a month unsuccessfully trying to secure his release. Then they launched a GoFundMe fundraiser that has now raised more than $28,000. His case has been covered by  WPRI, the Valley Breeze, and Newsweek, which ran the headline, “ICE Detains Man in US Since He Was a Teenager at Traffic Court.” 
GoFundMe organizer Amanda Fullam said she wants people to know that ICE kidnappings” aren’t just targeting dangerous criminals. “They’re happening to our neighbors and our friends,” Fullam told Rhode Island Current. “And they’re not being given the treatment or the opportunity that they should and that they deserve.”
Spadavecchia, who works as a sales and marketing director for an event transportation company, said he and de la Cruz spent nearly a decade trying to get proper papers for de la Cruz to gain legal status in the U.S. Among the forms they have in various stages of processing: an I-589 application for asylum, an I-130 petition for an alien relative, and a I- 601A application for a provisional unlawful presence waiver. “It shouldn’t take 10 years…to get a green card,” Spadavecchia said.  
At an Aug. 7 removal hearing with an immigration judge in Texas, de Le Cruz was granted permission to voluntarily self-deport. Given the facts of his situation, this was a good outcome, Spadavecchia said. If de la Cruz had been involuntarily deported, the path back to Rhode Island, if one exists at all, could take years. He must leave the country before Sept. 5. Spadavecchia said he plans to visit him in Guatemala.
Spadavecchia wants to share his husband’s story not to scare undocumented people, but to inform them of the risks. 
“I’ve told everyone, ‘If you have a court case, just don’t go. Send somebody else…Pay the fine,’” he said.
On a recent afternoon at the couple’s house in North Providence, the dining room table had two table settings, with plates, silverware, cloth napkins. They had been there since the day that de la Cruz was first detained in June. 
Spadavecchia, his voice cracking, said removing the table settings would be a form of giving up. And he wasn’t ready to do that.

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)Dozens of demonstrators gathered outside Richmond City Hall Monday afternoon to protest what they called an escalation of immigration enforcement across Virginia and to demand the city cut ties with federal immigration authorities.
Organized by Virginia Defenders for Freedom, Justice and Equality and several allied groups, the rally came in the aftermath of multiple Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detentions in Richmond over the summer. 
Advocates said the tactics — involving masked, plainclothes agents in unmarked cars — were indistinguishable from abductions and denied people any meaningful chance at due process.
“ICE kidnappings have been justified by the false narrative that only ‘the criminals’ or ‘the most dangerous people’ are being detained,” said Fernanda Diaz-Castro, a coordinator with the Virginia Defenders. Her speech was repeatedly interrupted by chants of “No Justice, No Peace” from the crowd and honks from passing drivers. 
“Not only does this divide-and-conquer rhetoric enable the dehumanization of our migrant communities, but it is also a lie disproven by ICE’s own data,” she added.
According to ICE statistics cited by Diaz-Castro, 868 people have been detained this year at Virginia’s two immigration detention facilities — Caroline Detention Center in Caroline County and Farmville Detention Center. She said 80% were classified by the agency as posing “no threat,” meaning they had no criminal record.
 Recent arrests draw scrutiny

The rally followed a series of enforcement actions in late July, including one in which 21-year-old Ricardo Martinez-Cantero was stopped while driving to work at a construction site in South Richmond. According to advocates, his vehicle was boxed in by unmarked cars, his window was smashed and he was pulled out and restrained before being taken into custody.
Advocates said his mother was unable to reach him for hours, and that attorneys and community members could not locate him in federal custody until two days later. By that point, Martinez-Cantero had already been transferred to Louisiana for processing. By Sunday morning, he had been deported to Honduras, seven hours from his hometown.
In a letter read aloud at the rally by Ana Edwards, chair of the Sacred Ground Historical Reclamation Project, Martinez-Cantero described being held in crowded cells without adequate food, witnessing another detainee suffer a seizure without prompt medical care and being moved between facilities before his deportation. 
He wrote that when confronted by agents, “I felt like the weight of the world was on top of me” and that his deportation left him “alone and afraid” in a country where he fears for his safety.
ICE officials did not respond Monday to a request for comment about the July arrests or the protesters’ allegations regarding tactics and treatment of detainees.
 Enforcement policies under scrutiny

Federal immigration enforcement has been a growing point of contention in Virginia this year. 
In February, Gov. Glenn Youngkin ordered state police and the Department of Corrections to cooperate with ICE on detainer requests and information sharing, a move his administration said would help “remove violent criminals from our communities.” 
Immigrant advocates argue the policy instead fuels fear, discouraging victims and witnesses from contacting police, and has expanded the scope of people targeted for detention.
According to recent ICE and advocacy group data, Virginia’s detention facilities are operating near their highest capacity in years. Caroline Detention Center, which has a contract to house ICE detainees, was at about 80% capacity earlier this year — its highest level since 2020.
Arrests have also been documented at or near courthouses, and during routine check-ins with immigration officers. 
Those practices have drawn criticism from lawmakers including U.S. Rep. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond, who last month visited the Chesterfield County Courthouse to highlight concerns about people being detained there.
Diaz-Castro said Monday such gestures fall short. 
“It is simply not enough for politicians to hold a press conference condemning actions taken by ICE without tangible plans to back it up,” she told the crowd. “We need to see elected officials take concrete measures to protect all community members.”
 Policy demands

At Monday’s protest, the Defenders outlined a list of changes they want city officials to pursue.
They urged Richmond to pass legislation prohibiting police and other city agencies from cooperating with ICE — a step some Virginia localities have already taken. Arlington County, for example, strengthened its “Trust Policy” in late 2024 to increase protections for immigrant communities after data showed many residents feared calling 911. Advocates said Richmond should make a similar commitment to public safety for all residents.

The group also called for an end to masked and unidentified policing. They want the city to make it illegal for officers or federal agents to carry out arrests in plain clothes, unmarked vehicles, or without visible identification, and to require judicial warrants for all immigration-related arrests.
Another demand is that Richmond refuse to renew contracts for Flock Safety surveillance cameras, which track vehicle movements and can be used by law enforcement without a warrant. Advocates argue the technology enables unchecked surveillance and can be used to target immigrant communities.
They also pressed city officials to secure rapid legal representation for detained residents, provide financial support to families who lose breadwinners to deportation, and oppose the expansion of detention facilities in Virginia. In the longer term, the group wants all existing facilities closed.
In addition, the Defenders urged elected officials to accompany residents to immigration court hearings, saying a visible presence can deter enforcement actions near courthouses. They also called for more funding to support community organizations such as the Sacred Heart Community Center, which provides language classes, legal clinics and other services to undocumented and under-documented residents.
 Emotional appeals from the podium

Speakers’ remarks alternated between policy arguments and personal accounts intended to humanize the impact of enforcement.
Josue Castillo, a community organizer with New Virginia Majority and the son of Honduran immigrants, said the raids have sown fear in neighborhoods and fractured families. 
“Every single person detained by ICE is more than a number,” he said. “They are a loved one, they are a friend, they are a parent or a child. … All of them have lives and stories that were senselessly uprooted by the hands of masked cowards.”
He said parents are now having difficult conversations with children about the possibility they might not come home from work one day. “These are real stories that are happening every day in this city, the state and across the country,” Castillo said.
The Rev. Rodney Hunter of Wesley Memorial United Methodist Church in Richmond compared ICE’s tactics to those of “kidnappers” and said constituents must hold officials accountable to “protect the citizens’ rights.”
In an interview with The Mercury, Nancy Wein, co-chair of the Virginia Coalition for Human Rights, called the situation “dire” and said advocacy needed to include both lobbying lawmakers and physically showing up at courthouses to support people facing deportation.
As the rally wound down, Diaz-Castro told the crowd their work was just beginning.
“If elected officials won’t protect us — we will,” she said, her voice carrying over the noise of downtown traffic.
Protesters carried signs reading “ICE out of Richmond” and “Police state is not our fate” as they dispersed into the heat, many saying they planned to be back at City Hall for the next council meeting on Sept. 8.

(Getty Images)Property insurance may be what’s on residents’ minds as Florida continues to grapple with high housing costs, but people need to look out for soaring health insurance costs in the coming year, too.
Fourteen insurers writing individual policies in Florida have proposed double-digit rate increases for Affordable Care Act-compliant plans in calendar year 2026, a review of federal data shows.
The Centers for Medicare & Medciaid Services (CMS) data show that Molina Healthcare wants an overall rate boost of nearly 41% for calendar year 2026, more than any other plan. According to its supporting documents, the increase could affect more than 90,000 policyholders. 
AmeriHealth Caritas requested the second highest overall rate hike at slightly more than 37% overall. Its justification data indicate the hit would average 35% for 55,000 policyholders.
Centene Venture Co. Florida requested the smallest rate increase, 18.73%. According to its supporting data, the increase would affect an estimated 1.3 million individuals.
Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Florida proposed an overall rate change of nearly 27%, according to the CMS website, although its rate justification notes that some members will experience increases above 15%.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Not alone
The proposed rate changes are preliminary and could change during the rate review process, which is expected to be completed by the federal government at the end of the summer. Open enrollment for 2026 individual coverage under the ACA, also known as “Obamacare,” through the federal  health insurance marketplace begins in the fall, as it does for most employer-sponsored insurance plans.
The federal government presents the rate changes in terms of an overall increase because the amount charged individuals varies depending on their geographic location, age, and which tier plan they choose to enroll in: bronze, silver, gold, or platinum.
Florida is not alone in these rate hikes — insurers nationwide are filing double-digit increases. A KFF review of marketplace plans submitted by 312 insurers in 50 states and the District of Columbia shows that the median proposed increase for 2026 is 18%, more than double last year’s 7% median proposed increase.
Insurers cited rising costs, utilization of services, and the loss of enhanced advanced premium tax benefits as the reasons behind the rate increases, according to KFF.
Mums the word?
While the proposed increases haven’t been finalized, they are looming and it’s not clear what, if anything, Florida insurance officials are doing to get the word out to people.
Attempts to contact Florida Insurance Consumer Advocate (ICA) Tasha Carter for this story were unsuccessful. There’s no reference to rising health insurance rates on the ICA’s website dedicated to consumer alerts and there’s no reference to health insurance rates in its Current Insurance Topics section.
Florida Conservatives for Affordable Health Care is holding a press conference in Tallahassee on Wednesday morning to address the rising rates and how they will soar particularly for those who have been relying on the enhanced premium tax credits to help with affordability.
‘Conservatives’ rally for continuation of enhanced Obamacare premium credits

Montana State Auditor James Brown issued a statement on Aug. 1 advising residents of the impending increases.
“The increase will affect small group health insurance plans offered both on and off the federally facilitated marketplace (HealthCare.gov as well as indiviudal marketplace plans — the plans used by many Montana small employers, independent workers, and families,” Brown said in the statement. “We want Montanans to be informed and prepared.”
Small-group filings
Carriers also filed proposed rate increases for plans sold to Florida’s small employers for 2026, those with of 50 or fewer workers. While less steep than the individual policies, many of the carriers requested double-digit or near double-digit increases. 
Neighborhood Health Partnership requested the highest overall increase for small group plans with a proposed overall 12.78% rate hike, whereas National Health Insurance Co. came in with the smallest proposed rate increase, at 8.38%.
According to the most recent Florida Office of Insurance Regulation data, most people in Florida who purchased health insurance policies in 2023 have individual coverage, and most of them have policies sold on the federal health insurance exchange.
The 2023 data show that more than 5.8 million people maintained commercial health insurance policies, and most of those people, 3.6 million-plus, had individual health insurance plans. Nearly 1.8 million people had large group plans, those sold to businesses with more than 51 employees. Small group policies insured another 400,164 lives in 2023. 
While more recent data on small group and large group enrollment isn’t avialable Obamacare enrollment in Florida in 2025 topped more than 4.6 million people.

In a video statement, EPA administrator Lee Zeldin called the program set to benefit more than 900,000 low-income households and disadvantaged communities across the U.S. a “grift.”

The federal government killed a program that was designed to reduce the cost of electricity for low-income Vermonters by installing millions of dollars worth of solar energy across the state. 
The state is set to lose $62.5 million in grant funding, according to a letter received by the state on Thursday evening from the Environmental Protection Agency. 
That grant was part of a $7 billion national initiative called Solar for All, introduced by U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-VT, as part of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. The program intended to pass on solar benefits to more than 900,000 households in low-income and disadvantaged communities across the country. Approximately 60 grant recipients, including 49 states and six Native American tribes, are affected. 
“The Department of Public Service, with the full support of Gov. Scott’s team, is working with our affected colleagues nationally, as well as the Vermont Attorney General’s Office, to pursue every opportunity including litigation to restore funding to this critical program,” Kerrick Johnson, commissioner of Vermont’s Public Service Department that received the grant, wrote in an email. “That work has just begun and so much more to come.”

On X, formerly known as Twitter, Sanders wrote on August 6 that the program “significantly reduces electric bills for nearly a million working class Americans, creates many thousands of jobs and cuts carbon emissions. That’s why the Trump administration wants to illegally cut it. We won’t let them.” 
The state has spent roughly $150,000 on staffing, and they bill EPA on a reimbursement basis for expenses the month after they incur them, according to Melissa Bailey, director of the state energy office within the Vermont Department of Public Service. 
The state has a grant agreement with Vermont Housing Finance Agency to support planning and implementation of one piece of the state’s Solar for All program, and that agency is  incurring expenses that they would expect to be reimbursed, according to Bailey. More than a third of the $62.5 million grant was awarded in May to the agency, a quasi-public entity that acts like a bank for affordable housing. 
From there, the funds would have been awarded to new affordable housing projects like multi-family apartment buildings, largely benefiting renters, in early 2026.
The EPA said it plans to reimburse states for money they’ve spent implementing the program so far, according to the agency’s August 7 letter.
Partners on the project, however, may not be made whole by a refund from the feds. While the state may attempt to subsidize those costs, the partners have built an annual program and staffing budget based on doing Solar for All work, Johnson said in an email. Those losses also don’t include “the potential loss of reduced energy bills for Vermonters due to this EPA action,” Johnson wrote. 
The cancellation came on the heels of the July 4 passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill. The law repealed grants from a $27 billion Inflation Reduction Act program called the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which aimed to lower carbon emissions. One of the three programs within that fund was Solar for All. 
In a video posted on Friday, EPA administrator Lee Zeldin said his agency “no longer has the authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive.” 
He called Solar for All a “grift” with 15% of programmatic costs going towards “middle men taking their own cut.”
But for states like Vermont, the purpose of the program was to help low-income energy users.
“Towns with the highest energy burden in Vermont have the least amount of installed solar,” Johnson told VTDigger in May. The primary objective of the program, Johnson said, was to deliver the grant’s benefits to disadvantaged Vermonters, regardless of where they live.

What Congress dubbed a “big, beautiful bill” could be true in several ways. In Montana, experts worry the big bill will be what patients and healthcare systems are left with after changes from the reconciliation package begin to be implemented.
Congress passed and President Donald J. Trump signed the massive budget package, even though the margins were among the slimmest in history.  Democrats warned the new provisions would decimate Medicaid, while Republicans insisted it would only eliminate waste, making it stable for decades to come.
Analysts have been tearing into the exact provisions and wording of the bill as it relates to Medicaid’s operation and funding. Many believe that while Medicaid will remain in place, it is predicted to deeply change, and states like Montana, which have experienced lower uninsured rates and better health outcomes, could see a sudden reversal.
 

  Federal fallout: Medicaid and insurance in Montana 

The Daily Montanan is launching a series of articles that breaks down some of the biggest changes implemented by Congress and signed into law by President Donald Trump in the so-called “Big, beautiful bill.”
All four members of Montana’s Congressional delegation — Republicans Sens. Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy, along with Reps. Troy Downing and Ryan Zinke — voted for these changes. 
Today’s stories are the first-installment:
Another big change in the Big Sky: Whether you’re one of more than 100,000 people on Medicaid or whether you purchase your health insurance on the marketplace (healthcare.gov), recent federal changes will mean a decrease in people who qualify under expanded Medicaid, as well as hefty health insurance premium hikes from those who purchase a plan. (Story by the Daily Montanan.)
Is $50 billion enough: Congress has allocated $50 billion to be used for rural state hospitals, which had been identified as particularly vulnerable in the “Big, beautiful” bill. Republicans from rural states demanded the money in exchange for the support, but will the fund be enough? And, what happens after it’s depleted? (Story by Stateline)



In many ways, the changes will likely be a repeat of what happened before Medicaid’s so-called expansion — fewer people who can afford coverage, more denials of coverage, and a ballooning amount of uncompensated or “charity” care for hospitals, health centers and doctors’ offices.
“This is the first rollback ever of our major healthcare programs,” said Drew Altman, President and CEO of KFF Foundation, a large nonprofit, nonpartisan healthcare research organization. “It’s the largest rollback ever.”
The reasons for that reversal lie primarily in the specific provisions changed by most Republicans with virtually no support from the Democrats.  Under the assumption of massive fraud and abuse, and an unsupported belief that millions are out of the workforce, just lapping up free health insurance while on the couch so to speak, many Republicans believe that eliminating fraud and waste, including denying insurance to undocumented immigrants, will make the program stable and solvent.
Before the bill passed, Montana’s senior U.S. Senator Steve Daines told Fox News why he supported the measure:	
    
 
“The bottom line is this, Republicans are trying to save Medicaid. We want to strengthen Medicaid, while the Democrats are trying to drain Medicaid. So the reforms that we are proposing, what you just described there in the so-called provider tax, that’s just a scheme that are used by the states to actually get more dollars than the federal government. This is one of the fastest growing entitlements currently in federal spending. It’s designed to protect those who are most vulnerable. It’s an important safety net, but we’ve got to reform Medicaid if we’re going to save Medicaid. We’ve got to take able-bodied males who are laying on the couches at home and get them back to work and off of Medicaid. Put a work requirement in and the reforms we have made we think are reasonable and it’s, again, the way we save this very important safety net.”

There’s little evidence to support widespread Medicaid. For example, in 2022 Texas reported a fraud rate of more than $219 million, while Montana had just more than $566,000, according to Becker’s Hospital Review. Only five states had less. According to the most recent data from Montana, 97% percent of those enrolled on Montana’s expanded Medicaid work at least part-time, if not full-time, or fit other exemptions like being a full-time student, caring for a family member or having a disability. The remaining 3% is estimated to be the natural churn that happens as people come off and onto the insurance, usually after losing or gaining a job.
Because the new changes are only beginning,  exact numbers for Montana are not publicly available, but using national data, officials can estimate the impact. In January, there were approximately 71.4 million people on Medicaid’s insurance programs, which includes the Children’s Insurance Program, or CHIP, according to the Pew Research Center. Current national estimates  say that an estimated 10% could lose coverage. In Montana, that translates to around 10,000 residents losing coverage.
Those numbers only reflect half of the risks: The current projections demonstrate the number of people who will lose Medicaid coverage due to work requirements or the new “redetermination” process that requires the state to more frequently check for employment and require more documentation. Most healthcare leaders, including Dr. Aaron Wernham, the CEO of the Montana Healthcare Foundation, say states will have a difficult time with the process given the current staff levels and they say the messy redetermination process that Montana went through in 2023-’24 could become a sort of new normal. What the numbers don’t estimate is the number of people who are wrongfully denied, or simply give up, unable to navigate the new system.
The Daily Montanan reached out multiple times to the Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services to ask about the changes. No official responded to those inquiries, including how the state was staffed and prepared for the new requirements, which will involve more verification and documentation.
  Two major impacts … so far 

Republicans were correct: Medicaid isn’t going away. Experts who have combed through the legislation say two major changes will likely mean upheaval, though.
The first change involves subsidies for the marketplace or healthcare exchange. During COVID-19, Congress authorized more help for insurance premiums on healthcare.gov. Those COVID-era enhancements are going away unless Congress reauthorizes them, something unlikely given Congress’ current political make-up.
“Premiums in the marketplace will skyrocket by, on average, more than 75% but it’s 90% in rural areas, enrollment will plunge by as much as 50% according to analysis form the actuarial firm, Wakely, and that adds about 4.2 million people (nationally) to the ranks of the uninsured,” Altman said.
The other more noticeable change is more a result of what’s likely to happen, according to Altman: As more people lose health insurance coverage through the redetermination process or through not being able to afford coverage, hospitals and doctors will likely see an increase in “uncompensated care,” often termed “charity care.” For hospitals and healthcare centers that often have margins of less than 2%, a sudden increase in uncompensated care could mean the difference between financial survival and closure. That concern is particularly pronounced in rural areas like Montana, which has a number of small hospitals, called “Critical Access Hospitals,” which have survived the recent tumultuous COVID-era because of reimbursements.
Larry Levitt, the Executive Vice President for Public Policy at KFF, says that it will be the biggest rollback in U.S. history of a major program.
“It amounts to what is effectively a partial repeal of the Affordable Care Act, erasing a lot of its gains in health coverage,” Levitt said.
Some rural hospitals have even seen enough stability and success because of fewer uninsured patients to add service lines, like mental health or orthopedic surgery, so that residents can access those services closer to home instead of driving to a more urbanized center.
As part of the “big beautiful bill,” Congress authorized a one-time $50 billion lump sum that will be issued to states in a block-grant format, allowing each state to determine how to best use the federal funds. However, how those funds will be spent is still uncertain, and some hospital leaders say it will just delay an inevitable crisis when the funding runs out and healthcare centers are stuck with more charity care.
“We saw rural hospitals stabilize,” Wernham said. “Now, we’re going to have to see what happens to the rural healthcare systems because they tend to have the lowest margins. That will force many of them to make difficult decisions and figure out how to keep their doors open.”
Wernham said that even as some rural hospitals in Montana opened new “service lines” — for example, surgery or mental health — they may have to be closed. That, Wernham said, doesn’t just affect the Medicaid patients, but the entire community.
“You don’t just cut services that are available to Medicaid, you cut services that affect the entire community whether you have private insurance or not,” Wernham said.
  About those premiums 

Montana Commissioner of Insurance James Brown has already started warning residents that health insurance premiums are expected to rise in 2025, especially on the marketplace exchange. Brown’s office doesn’t control rates, but carriers are required to file their annual rates and plans from now until the middle of August.
“This increase will affect small group health insurance plans offered both on and off the federally facilitated marketplace (healthcare.gov), as well as individual marketplace health plans — the plans used by many Montana small employers, independent workers, and families,” Brown said in a press release. “We want Montanans to be informed and prepared.”
Longtime healthcare navigator Olivia Riutta has another phrase for it — sticker shock.
In Montana, Riutta said, 87% of the state gets tax credits to participate in marketplace insurance. So she said, if 87% of the people get tax credits, then 87% will experience sticker shock.
“We are encouraging people to get your documents and get prepared,” Riutta said.

How Much More Would People Pay in Premiums if the ACA’s Enhanced Subsidies Expired?




 
She said a very basic example of what could change is a “silver” plan offered in Montana. A person making minimum wage — or $10.55 per hour — is eligible for a silver plan for $0 with the current subsidies.
However, without those subsidies, that plan for an individual rises to $63 per month.
“But they’re already having a tough time affording housing or groceries. Now they have to find another $63 per month,” she said.
Many people enrolled in the marketplace received increased subsidies, a holdover from the COVID-era, which helped make health insurance more affordable. For example, those who made too much money to qualify for Medicaid, but struggled to afford insurance, benefitted from the subsidies provided by Congress. That led to more participation in the marketplace. That shift, in turn, meant more people were insured at better prices, and because more people utilized insurance, carriers could spread the risk among a larger group of people. That helped keeping plans affordable.
However, with those subsidies disappearing, premiums are likely to jump considerably, leaving residents with few enviable choices: Either more of their income will have to go toward healthcare premiums, or they will have to choose plans that cover less and force larger out-of-pocket expenses or deductibles.
“At the end of the day, cost (of the plans) is the biggest concern they have,” Riutta said.
Cynthia Cox, the Vice President for the ACA Programs at KFF, said that many people who pay roughly 8.5% of their income could see it that percentage more than double.
Experts say that some may opt for plans with less coverage, making individuals vulnerable to more expenses in case of sickness or surgery. Others, though, may decide against health insurance at all, leaving them uninsured or covered by extremely limited plans that could lead to financial disaster in case of an emergency or disease.
“All of this points to delaying your decision to see a doctor, which as we know, is not best practice,” Riutta said.
She said that the health insurance marketplace has seen “record enrollment” because Congress has made it affordable to different groups. She worries that as the federal government makes it less affordable, there will be a resurgence of uninsured individuals.
However, even a return to previous marketplace times may mean the people purchasing insurance consider it a necessity and may need it for a chronic health condition. That, in turn, means that the pools — or groups — of people are sicker, which also pushes rates higher in the future.
“This isn’t great for anyone in the insurance market because the costs will get spread around,” Riutta said.
Riutta warned that people who auto enroll or are satisfied with their plan, and plan to let it “auto renew,” should make sure they see the premium price differences because the new rules don’t allow the flexibility to change after Jan. 15.
Some may opt to step down a level from a gold or a silver to a bronze plan, but those changes could come with higher out-of-pocket costs.
“What we think is really most important come Nov. 1 — the first day of open enrollment — is that people need to compare and shop around,” she said. “Really understand how a plan does or doesn’t work.”
If people choose not to enroll, it will mean big bills from hospitals or delaying care until they become eligible.
“If people can’t enroll in insurance, what we know is that people will delay care. And that means fewer check-ups and catching things early,” Riutta said, for example typical cancer screenings.
 Uncompensated care 

Many in the healthcare field say they’re already preparing for a rise in uncompensated, or “charity” care, which happens when healthcare systems are forced to see patients and treat them, regardless of their ability to pay. Those losses end up being absorbed or “eaten” by the clinics, which can only handle so much financial loss before shuttering. And, in rural areas, often not served by a lot of healthcare systems, a higher percentage of people are uninsured or come through the doors with unmanaged chronic conditions, like diabetes.
In many ways, the changes to Medicaid represent a sort of turning back the clock when hospitals saw a large number of people come through the emergency room because they had no other option.
The tragedy, at least from Montana’s healthcare providers Wernham said, is that as Medicaid continued to expand and become established in Montana, the average cost of patient was decreasing while the overall health outcomes were increasing, largely because leaders say those with health insurance were managing chronic conditions before they became expensive, life-threatening emergencies.
“What we’ve seen is fewer ER visits. We see costs stabilizing and shift toward outpatient care,” Wernham said. “So even though costs are going up, the costs for adults who are stabilized actually goes down.
Even if the federal government gives Montana enough money to support its critical access hospitals and other healthcare centers, the money is only budgeted through 2030. Montana Hospital Association CEO Ed Buttrey said that while Congress committed a lump-sump payment of $50 billion as a compromise to help garner support from Republican senators in rural states, that will only be given during the course of five years.
After that, he said, rural hospitals may face an eventual economic cliff. Buttrey helped expand and keep Medicaid in the state as a Republican leader in the Legislature.
“It’s not going to help a lot after that,” Buttrey said.
And how those funds will be spread out and used has not yet been decided, adding to small healthcare centers’ anxiety.
Rural health centers could be impacted by being unable to recruit healthcare staff and doctors because of the funding uncertainty, another destabilizing force.
“The downside is that we can’t continue with this type of financial insecurity,” Buttrey said. “What happens after that, when, poof — that money is gone?”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-636170768-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-11 17:57:24.627960

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)Congress set aside $50 billion for rural hospitals and medical providers to allay fears over the billions more in historic cuts to federal health care spending that President Donald Trump signed into law on Independence Day.
But is that bandage big enough to save struggling rural hospitals?
“I have more questions than I have answers,” said Alan Morgan, CEO of the National Rural Health Association, a nonprofit policy group. “No one has those answers yet.”
Morgan noted that the new money for rural health, to be spent over five years, is far less than the $155 billion in rural Medicaid spending cuts over 10 years, as estimated by KFF, a nonprofit health policy and research group.
Experts, hospital leaders and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle fear that Trump’s signature legislation will particularly gut rural hospitals and clinics, which see an outsize share of patients who are insured through Medicaid, the federal-state public health insurance for people with low incomes. The new law slashes more than $1 trillion from Medicaid over the next 10 years to help pay for tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the wealthy.
 

The $50 billion addition was an effort by Republican leaders in Congress to win the votes of colleagues within their party who initially balked at supporting such steep cuts to Medicaid and other health services.
In the U.S. Senate, the rural program helped secure the vote of Alaska moderate Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who expressed concern about the law’s impact on health care in her state. About 1 in 3 Alaskans are insured through Medicaid.
Jared Kosin, the president and CEO of the Alaska Hospital & Healthcare Association, said he’s deeply frustrated with the new law’s gutting of Medicaid funding, which he thinks will wreak lasting damage on Alaskans. And Republicans sidestepped potential solutions by just throwing money into a program, he said.
“It’s frustrating in the public realm when decisions like this are made fast and, frankly, carelessly,” he said.
“The consequences are going to fall on us, not them.”
More than half of the law’s cuts to funding in rural areas are concentrated in 12 states with large rural populations that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act to cover more people, according to KFF: Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and Virginia.
Some GOP lawmakers in Congress have heralded the $50 billion rural program as a health care victory. But it’s still unclear which hospitals, clinics and other providers would receive money and how much.
  How it works 

The Rural Health Transformation Program will dole out $10 billion annually from fiscal years 2026 through 2030.
States must apply for their funding by the end of this year, submitting a detailed plan on how it would be used.
The law outlines some ways that states can use the money, according to an analysis of the legislation from the Bipartisan Policy Center:

Making payments to rural hospitals to help them maintain essential services such as emergency room care or labor and delivery.
Recruiting and training rural doctors, nurses and other health workers.
Bolstering emergency medical services such as ambulances and EMTs.
Using new technologies, including telehealth.
Providing opioid use disorder treatment and mental health services.
Improving preventive care and chronic disease management.

Half of the $10 billion each year will be distributed evenly across states that have applied for it. The other half can be distributed by the administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services — currently Dr. Mehmet Oz — at his discretion, based on a state’s rural population and rural health facilities.
Although the program doesn’t replace the amount states are likely to lose, Morgan said it’s still an opportunity to rethink how rural health care is funded. He’d like to see states given flexibility in how they’re able to use the funds, and he hopes they focus on keeping rural communities healthy through preventive care while still helping hospitals keep their doors open.
“If done correctly, it could really change the future course for rural America,” Morgan said. “That is such a tough ask, though.”
  Hardest hit 

Kentucky could take the biggest hit from the new law’s reduction in rural Medicaid funding, losing an estimated $12 billion over 10 years, according to a KFF analysis.

The state’s Medicaid department is still waiting for additional federal guidance to understand how the state’s program will be affected, Kendra Steele, spokesperson with the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services, told Stateline in a statement.
“Over 1.4 million Kentuckians rely on Medicaid — including half of all children in our state, seniors and more vulnerable populations — and the passage of legislation on the federal level will have serious impacts for those individuals, rural health care and hospitals and local economies,” she wrote.
Even with the new program, states across the country will have to reevaluate their budgets in light of the cuts, said Hemi Tewarson, executive director at the National Academy for State Health Policy, a nonpartisan group that supports states in developing health care policies.
“Every region is slightly different and there’s not a one-size-fits-all approach,” she said. “Hospital ownership varies (as well as) the types of services that are critical for the community where they’re located. They have to think about new ways to provide those services in a context with fewer resources.”
About 44% of rural hospitals are operating in the red, according to a KFF analysis of Rand Hospital Data, a higher share than the 35% of hospitals in urban areas.
  ‘Rural at heart’ 

Prior to the bill’s passage, Oz attempted to reassure U.S. House Republicans that their districts could get money from the program even if they weren’t specifically rural, Politico reported earlier this month.




We’re all rural at heart when it comes to money.


– Alan Morgan, CEO of the National Rural Health Association



Pennsylvania Republican U.S. Rep. Rob Bresnahan said money would begin flowing to his district as early as the beginning of next year, telling the Wilkes-Barre Times Leader earlier this month that he met with Trump, Oz and others to secure pledges that hospitals in his district could access the fund. He represents the northeastern corner of Pennsylvania, which includes suburban and rural areas, as well as the cities of Scranton and Wilkes-Barre.
Though the legislation includes guidelines on which facilities or areas qualify as “rural,” Morgan, of the National Rural Health Association, expects a mad dash from lawmakers and providers to claim rural status in order to get a piece of the funding.
“That’s going to be a huge issue — defining who’s rural,” Morgan said. “We’re all rural at heart when it comes to money.”

Denson announced the DMACC Opportunity Scholarship to Iowa State Fair attendees Sunday. He said in an interview the community college wants to “invest in students that are serious about education,” and data from the DMACC Foundation shows those who receive a scholarship from the foundation are around 30 percentage points more likely to complete their education than those who do not receive support.
“There are a lot of individuals that (are) working hard, they’ve got families, and they know they need to improve their lives,” Denson said. “So we want to make sure that we can help them make it happen.”

The scholarship will be established with $45,000 from the Dolores Rawson-Denson Scholarship fund, created by Denson’s mother before her death last year, Denson said. His sister has also donated $5,000 to the new scholarship, he said, with the goal of raising money to expand the endowment and keep the scholarship available far in the future.
According to the Opportunity Scholarship website, in order to qualify for the program, students must demonstrate financial need through the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) or other documents and be Pell-eligible, as well as meet academic criteria and “commit to completing your program and advancing your future.”
The scholarship established in his mother’s name is available on a rolling basis for students to apply and Denson said he would like the new program to be as well, as no one can predict when something will impact finances or other areas of life. Recipients will be able to use the dollars for tuition, fees, books and other materials needed to complete their degree.
“We can’t do everything, but if we know we’ve got a student that’s been working hard, we’re not going to let one life event squash their dreams,” Denson said.

Ninguna fue aprobada, pero los defensores afirmaron que planean seguir intentándolo.","This article is also available in English. Read it here.
Recortes de fondos. Redadas cerca de las escuelas. Exclusión de programas como Head Start y formación profesional. Durante meses, la administración Trump ha estado socavando los derechos de los estudiantes sin estatus legal en las escuelas públicas.
 ¿Podría la administración retirarles por completo el derecho a la educación pública gratuita a esos estudiantes? Los expertos afirman que ese podría ser el siguiente paso.
 “La gente lleva un par de décadas preocupada por esto, pero esto es diferente”, dijo Patricia Gándara, profesora de educación y codirectora del Proyecto de Derechos Civiles de la UCLA. “Ahora mismo debemos estar extremadamente alertas. Esta gente no se detendrá ante nada”.
 Un fallo de la Corte Suprema de Estados Unidos de 1982, Plyler v. Doe , garantiza a todos los estudiantes, independientemente de su estatus migratorio, el derecho a una educación pública gratuita en escuelas primarias y secundarias. Sin embargo, el año pasado, la conservadora Heritage Foundation solicitó a la Corte Suprema que revocara el fallo y que los estados cobraran matrícula a las familias inmigrantes, incluso si sus hijos eran ciudadanos estadounidenses. La justificación es que las escuelas gastan miles de millones de dólares en la educación de estos estudiantes, dinero que, en cambio, debería destinarse a estudiantes que, junto con sus padres, son ciudadanos estadounidenses por nacimiento.
 El Proyecto 2025, también publicado por la Heritage Foundation, se hace eco de esa visión.
Una política de este tipo tendría un impacto descomunal en California, donde casi la mitad de los niños tienen al menos un padre inmigrante, según el Instituto de Políticas Públicas de California.
 “Esto tendría enormes impactos negativos”, dijo Megan Hopkins, directora del departamento de educación de la UC San Diego. “Para empezar, tendríamos una población con menor nivel educativo y menos alfabetizada, lo que afectaría la economía y prácticamente todos los demás aspectos de la vida en California”. 
 Matrícula para no ciudadanos
 El caso Plyler contra Doe surgió de un caso en Texas a principios de la década de 1980. El estado había aprobado una ley que permitía a las escuelas cobrar matrícula a estudiantes no ciudadanos. El Distrito Escolar Independiente de Tyler, Texas, una pequeña ciudad a unos 160 kilómetros al sureste de Dallas, fue uno de los distritos que lo intentó, lo que desencadenó una demanda que finalmente llevó el caso a la Corte Suprema.
 La Corte Suprema falló a favor de los demandantes, argumentando que los niños que no son ciudadanos tienen derecho a la misma protección ante la ley. Aun así, el fallo fue ajustado —5 a 4—, a pesar de que el tribunal fue más liberal que hoy.
 Desde entonces, el fallo ha caído prácticamente en el olvido. Sin embargo, ha habido intentos ocasionales de restringir la presencia de inmigrantes en las escuelas, tanto en California como en otros lugares. En 1994 , los votantes de California aprobaron la Proposición 187 , que prohibía a los inmigrantes que vivían ilegalmente en Estados Unidos recibir prestaciones públicas, incluido el acceso a las escuelas públicas. Un tribunal federal la bloqueó antes de su entrada en vigor.
 En 2011, Alabama aprobó una ley que obligaba a las escuelas a recopilar información sobre el estatus migratorio de los estudiantes. Dicha ley fue posteriormente bloqueada por un tribunal federal. En 2022, el gobernador de Texas, Greg Abbott, se declaró a favor de revisar el caso Plyler v. Doe y afirmó que los estados no deberían tener que pagar por la educación de estudiantes sin estatus migratorio legal.
 Desde que la Fundación Heritage publicó su informe, cerca de media docena de estados han intentado aprobar leyes que permitirían a las escuelas cobrar matrícula a los no ciudadanos. Ninguna se aprobó el año pasado, pero los defensores afirmaron que planean seguir intentándolo. 
Ruta a la Corte Suprema
 Es probable que cuenten con un partidario comprensivo en el presidente Donald Trump, quien hasta ahora ha seguido muchas de las políticas propuestas por el Proyecto 2025. En los últimos meses, su administración ha intensificado los arrestos migratorios y ha declarado que ya no reconocerá a las escuelas como refugios seguros frente a las autoridades. También recortó (aunque posteriormente los restableció tras demandas de los estados) la financiación para estudiantes migrantes y prohibió a los estudiantes sin estatus legal acceder a Head Start, la educación para adultos y la formación profesional y técnica.
 El asunto podría llegar a la Corte Suprema de al menos dos maneras. Un estado podría aprobar una ley que permita a las escuelas públicas cobrar matrícula, lo que daría lugar a una demanda que podría llegar a la Corte Suprema. O Trump podría emitir una orden ejecutiva que también podría desencadenar una demanda.
 Erwin Chemerinsky, decano de la Facultad de Derecho de la UC Berkeley, dijo que algunas de las acciones de Trump, como excluir a niños sin estatus legal de Head Start, ya constituyen una violación de Plyler.
 “No cabe duda de que la administración Trump ha aumentado la presión sobre Plyler”, dijo Chemerinsky. “Sin duda, lo que está haciendo Trump podría llevar a casos que llegarían a la Corte Suprema. ¿Podría esta corte revocar la decisión de Plyler? Claro que sí. Bastaría con que cinco jueces quisieran anularla”.
 Incluso si no se revoca, los cambios actuales en las políticas han tenido un efecto negativo en las escuelas y las familias inmigrantes, afirmó Hopkins, de la Universidad de California en San Diego. La asistencia escolar ha disminuido en las comunidades que experimentan medidas drásticas contra la inmigración, lo que ha tenido repercusiones académicas para algunos estudiantes y ha ampliado la brecha de rendimiento entre los estudiantes latinos y otros grupos. Un informe reciente de Análisis de Políticas para la Educación de California reveló que los estudiantes latinos y los estudiantes de inglés obtuvieron peores resultados en matemáticas e inglés tras los arrestos por inmigración en sus comunidades, e informó de un aumento significativo del acoso escolar.
 Hopkins también afirmó que las políticas no son especialmente eficaces. Si el objetivo es animar a los inmigrantes a regresar voluntariamente a sus países de origen, las investigaciones han demostrado que esto no suele ocurrir. Tras la aprobación de la ley antiinmigrante en Alabama en 2011, muchas familias simplemente se mudaron a Misisipi.
 ‘Nuestro mayor miedo’
 En el condado de Monterey, las nuevas políticas han generado temor y confusión generalizados entre las familias inmigrantes, afirmó Deneen Guss, superintendente de la Oficina de Educación del Condado de Monterey. La asistencia ha disminuido no solo en las escuelas, sino también en los eventos comunitarios.
 Para apoyar a las familias, las escuelas han estado organizando noches de información “Conozca sus derechos” (en persona y virtualmente), han alentado a los padres a presentar planes de cuidado infantil a las escuelas en caso de que un padre sea arrestado, han distribuido folletos en español sobre cómo ayudar a los niños que experimentan ansiedad y han proporcionado una amplia gama de recursos legales y de otro tipo.
 Pero cuando la administración Trump anunció que prohibiría la entrada a Head Start a estudiantes sin estatus legal, “me hizo reflexionar”, dijo Guss. “Me hizo pensar que realmente iban a por Plyler. Ese es nuestro mayor temor”.
 Le preocupa el impacto que esto tendría en las familias, así como en el personal escolar, que de repente sería responsable de verificar la documentación de ciudadanía de los estudiantes. Actualmente, las escuelas no preguntan por el estatus migratorio de los estudiantes.
 “El trabajo de los educadores ya es bastante difícil”, dijo Guss. “Nuestro trabajo es brindarles a los niños la mejor educación posible. No nos obliguen a convertirnos en agentes de inmigración. Es un puesto que no queremos”.
 Ha estado instando a los padres y al público a mantenerse informados y alzar la voz. Independientemente de si la Corte Suprema revoca la decisión de Plyler, es casi seguro que las políticas antiinmigrantes continuarán, con consecuencias devastadoras para los estudiantes.
 “No podemos quedarnos de brazos cruzados y fingir que todo va a estar bien”, dijo Guss. “La gente necesita asegurarse de que su voz sea escuchada. Y tenemos que luchar por nuestros hijos”.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/02282023_COLISEUMELEMENTARY_PU_CM_24.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-11 16:57:03.926001
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-11 20:44:16+00:00,CT Mirror,UI is building a series of floodwalls to protect its coastal substations,John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/11/united-illuminating-floodwalls-ct-storms/,The floodwalls are designed to protect infrastructure and prevent major damage from storms that can lead to power outages.,"When Superstorm Sandy sent a nearly 10-foot storm surge into Bridgeport’s South End in 2012, workers at United Illuminating’s Singer substation watched as the floodwaters crept down Atlantic Street before arriving at the base of the plant.
Had waters risen much higher, those workers would have had to cut off the flow of electricity to protect the station’s critical infrastructure  — potentially disrupting power for tens of thousands of people across the region.
“The water level got to under the door and we had people stay here, getting ready to open up circuits,” said Ben Acampora, a construction chief for the utility.

It was not the first time that the substation, which sits in a coastal floodplain, was threatened by a storm surge. A year before, the neighborhood was similarly inundated by Hurricane Irene.
Luckily, neither storm caused much damage to the substation, even as they ravaged other parts of Connecticut. But to avoid more serious consequences from future storms, United Illuminating recently began construction of a 16-foot-high steel floodwall around the substation to keep the waters at bay.
The Singer project — which is expected to be completed in 2027 at a cost of $47 million — is one of three similar floodwalls that the Orange-based utility has either constructed or is planning to build to protect coastal substations. 
Last year, UI finished construction of its first floodwall around the Congress Street Substation, also in Bridgeport. The final project, a wall protecting the Grand Ave./Mill River Substation in New Haven, is due to be completed in 2028, officials said.
The combined cost of all three projects is expected to be $146 million, according to a UI spokeswoman. 
Utilities such as United Illuminating generally operate two types of substations: transmission stations, which send bulk electricity from power plants long distances over high-voltage transmission lines, and distribution stations which take that electricity, lower the voltage and feed it into the local distribution system where it arrives at homes and businesses.

Renni Pavolini, the unit manager of substation projects at UI, said the consequences of flood damage to a transmission station such as Singer could potentially be “catastrophic” for parts of the New England power grid.
“We will have to shut down the substation, and depending on the damage… it could take days, or it could be just hours,” to restore power, Pavolini said. “Our system, the grid, it’s done in a way that if this [station] is down, we probably could feel it with other substations.”
Connecticut’s other major electric utility, Eversource, is also in the process of adding a layer of protection to its network of substations. 
Since 2019, Eversource has spent $9.5 million completing flood mitigation projects at five of its distribution substations around the state, and two more have been scheduled for upgrades. In addition, three substations in the coastal towns of Guilford, Branford and Madison have been removed from service due to the risk of flooding, according to a spokeswoman for the utility.
Elli Ntakou, Eversource’s manager of system resilience and reliability, said the utility recently completed a climate vulnerability assessment to determine which substations or other infrastructure were vulnerable to sea level rise, inland flooding or other climate threats such as drought and extreme heat.
‘We have a granular analysis so we understand the impact to specific assets,” Ntakou said. “The specific stations that we think are higher risk, that’s where we target our mitigations so we make it cost efficient.

The risk that climate changes poses to electric infrastructure is not confined to either utility’s service areas, Connecticut or even coastal regions in general.
Power outages, which can be costly for both utilities and their customers, are growing in frequency across the country due to extreme weather, according to the most recent National Climate Assessment. The same report found that climate change could push expenditures on electricity transmission and distribution infrastructure up an additional 25% by 2090. 
The report, released in 2023 under the Biden administration, was removed from government websites after President Donald Trump took office earlier this year.
Locally, the threat floodwaters pose to electric infrastructure is especially concentrated in and around Bridgeport Harbor with its network of substations, transmission lines and power plants.
An ongoing project to build a flood protection system around the city’s South End, known as Resilient Bridgeport, was slated to receive more than $47 million from the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s pre-disaster grant program before the latest round of awards were cut off by the Trump administration earlier this year. (In response, Connecticut Attorney General William Tong joined a lawsuit last month seeking to order the release of that money.)

UI’s Singer Station project, meanwhile, is not reliant on federal funding. Like the utility’s other floodwall projects, it is being paid for by UI customers through transmission and distribution rates within their utility bills. 
The Singer floodwall is being built to withstand FEMA’s estimates for a 100-year flood event, plus an additional three feet of water, Pavolini said. 
In the first phase of construction, crews drove a series of 57 king pile beams into the bedrock below the substation, with their exposed tops forming the skeleton of the wall. From there, steel sheet piles are currently being installed between the beams to form the protective layer around the facility. Two gates allowing access to the substation will be able to be sealed in the event of a storm.
As a last step, the wall will covered with a layer of concrete so that it blends in aesthetically with the rest of the building, before being topped with a security fence.
In addition to the building of walls, UI recently completed construction on its brand new $142 million Pequonnock Substation in Bridgeport. The new substation, which is located on higher ground further back from the Pequonnock River, replaced an older facility that was vulnerable to coastal flooding.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/UI-FLOODWALL-0808-SR-3-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-11 16:57:03.926001

Inside, long dumpsters were being filled with the ruined remains cleared out of roadways and people’s homes after flood waters blanketed swaths of Milwaukee County on Aug. 9 and 10. 
Mayor Cavalier Johnson joined DPW Commissioner Jerrell Kruschke at the dump site to provide updates about the flood response Monday. “Some of these stories that we’re hearing are truly, remarkably sad,” said Johnson, recalling that the first message he received was from his uncle, whose basement was filled with water. From the North Side to the South Side, west towards Wauwatosa and east towards Lake Michigan, the flood quickly engulfed roadways and homes. 
“So my thoughts are with everybody, everybody who is dealing with issues trying to clear out a basement, folks that are enduring power outages, trying to sort out, figure out what to do with the car that has been flooded through,” said Johnson. “We’re working through the process of obtaining some disaster declarations so we can bring the appropriate aid to those citizens who have been affected by the downpour.”

Gov. Tony Evers has activated the Wisconsin National Guard to assist efforts in Milwaukee County. It’s unclear at this time what role, if any, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will have in Milwaukee, as the level of damage needs to meet a certain threshold in order for the agency to be activated. The agency has also been threatened with funding cuts and possible shutdown by the Trump administration. 
Johnson stressed that the weekend storm, which dropped over 10 inches of rain in some areas, was extremely rare. Timmerman Airfield recorded over 14 inches of rainfall. “I think I said the other day that last time something like this happened was about a decade or so ago,” the mayor said. “I certainly hope that a storm like this is not visited upon this city for at least another millennium,” he continued, referring to the weekend storm being called a “thousand year flood”. Kruschke echoed the mayor’s comments about the rarity of the massive flooding over the weekend. Johnson said he’d heard on the news that it dropped essentially “a summer’s-worth of rain” in a single storm. 
Yet research on climate change had long-predicted that Wisconsin would experience increased rain, more intense storms, and greater risks of flooding. In late 2020, a report from UW-Madison and state health workers warned that climate change in Wisconsin would mean more rainfall over fewer days, which would likely cause flooding. The report noted that the weather changes could have a cascade of health effects including heat stroke from increased heat (which also fuels more powerful storms), asthma and insect-borne diseases. In 2021, severe storms downed hundreds of trees in Milwaukee County. The following summer, communities across Wisconsin experienced heat waves, heavy rainfall, high winds and tornadoes over a couple of days, during which time people lost their lives to heat stroke, or after being swept away during heavy rainfall. By 2022, global CO2 levels exceeded 400 parts per million, a red line which scientists warned would spur even worse effects.

Answering a question from Wisconsin Examiner about the climate trends, Kruschke said that rainfall events have been documented for a long time, and that DPW is relying on historical data. Kruschke said that the city was not prepared for the volume of rain that fell so quickly. As for whether the city can adapt to future weather patterns, Mayor Johnson said, “I’ve been thinking about this since this storm happened.” 
Johnson praised the DPW’s work with the Milwaukee Metro Sewerage District (MMSD) to create infrastructure to capture rainfall when it hits the ground. “So when you look at our construction projects in the city of Milwaukee, when you see bioswales in the street, that’s to make sure that we keep rain out of sewers. That’s to make sure that we keep rain out of people’s basements. When you see MMSD working to make improvements at the parks in order to capture more rainwater there, that’s in order to make sure that we plan for events like this. When folks are going out to install rain barrels in their neighborhood, that’s in order to make sure that we stop things like this. When you have folks out in the city, like they were during this flood event, making sure that the sewer grates are clear so that water is better able to get into the sewers and not in people’s basements, all of these things play a role, and all of these things make a difference.” 
Johnson said the city will continue investing in “green infrastructure” from roadway design to the creation of outdoor classrooms that  capture rain. “There’s a lot of work that’s going into this,” said Johnson. “I just imagine what this would’ve turned out if we hadn’t done that work over the past number of years. I mean, who knows how many hundreds of thousands or perhaps even millions of gallons of storm water that we were able to capture that didn’t end up in the streets, that didn’t end up in people’s basements.”

The city and county are continuing to assess the full scale of the damage, including  how many homes have been affected and people displaced. Monday morning, the Milwaukee County Medical Examiner’s Office stated in response to an inquiry from  the Wisconsin Examiner that there had been no deaths directly linked to the flooding. However, the Milwaukee Police Department’s Harbor Patrol did locate a 49-year-old Native American man, identified as Juan Carlos Sierra Campos, floating face-down in Lake Michigan on Sunday morning. An investigation is ongoing. 
Kruschke said the public works department  will continue working normal hours (7 a.m. to 3 p.m.), and operate special trash disposal procedures for people clearing out damaged or ruined property. Fees will be waived for city drop-off centers, with the centers operating free of charge until Aug. 17. Drop-off centers will also be open Mondays, when they would normally be closed. The drop-off centers are located at 3878 W. Lincoln Ave. and 6600 N Industrial Road. 
A small number of street sweepers are out on the roadways, and some communities  are deploying dump trucks and other vehicles to assist. DPW is also offering special pick-ups for storm-damaged material. Among the items that will not be accepted are  explosive or flammable products, propane tanks, large gas appliances, fluorescent light bulbs, wet or oil-based paint and material or vehicles from contractors or businesses.

Cars that were swept away or abandoned during the floods may have been towed to alternate locations so as to not overwhelm the city’s usual tow yards. The city does not have a count of the number of cars towed or abandoned. Overnight parking enforcement will be suspended Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday nights.
Residents are encouraged to avoid wading through flooded areas or standing water. The possibility of contaminated water or hidden debris makes wading unsafe. The Red Cross has also opened two shelters for people who have been displaced by the flooding.

The Utah Department of Commerce’s Division of Consumer Finance, which works with the Utah Attorney General’s Office to investigate and enforce the state’s consumer protection laws involving robocalls, announced on Thursday that Utah is joining the national effort. 
“The Anti-Robocall Litigation Task Force is sending warning letters to 37 voice providers, demanding that they act now to stop illegal robocalls from routing through their networks,” the Division of Consumer Protection said in a news release.

The Anti-Robocall Litigation Task Force was created in 2022 when all 51 attorneys general joined forces to tackle illegal robocalls. The task force investigates and takes legal action against companies responsible for big volumes of illegal and fraudulent robocalls that are routed into and across the U.S. It’s led by North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson, Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita, and Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost. 
Those 37 companies — which the division listed by name — haven’t complied with Federal Communications Commission rules about responding to government traceback requests, haven’t registered with the FCC’s Robocall Mitigation Databases, or haven’t filed a plan that describes how they will reduce illegal robocalls on their network, according to state officials. 
“By disregarding these simple rules, these companies are allowing robocallers onto their phone networks and then passing their calls on to other downstream providers until they reach the phones of Utahns,” the Utah’s commerce division said. 
The voice service providers receiving warning letters are:

State officials also said the task force is also sending letters to 99 “downstream providers that accept call traffic from the 37 companies, so that they know they are doing business with bad actors that are not willing to follow the rules that apply to everyone equally. ”
Several of these companies are also being scrutinized by the FCC, according to the division. Last week, it announced that it will remove seven of those providers from the Robocall Mitigation Database, which means that other providers will no longer be able to accept and route calls from their networks. 
The Utah Division of Consumer Protection — which is tasked with safeguarding Utahns from illegal robocalls and other consumer protection issues — encouraged Utahns to visit its website for more details or to file a complaint.

The newly accessible tract represents a little more than half of the Antelope mine's annual production but signals more coal mining actions to come.
The post Trump greenlights 14.5 million-ton coal expansion in Wyoming appeared first on WyoFile .","One of Wyoming’s largest coal mines just unlocked more than 14 million tons of federal coal in the Powder River Basin, a little more than half the volume the mine produces in a year, according to the company.
The Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement approved the West Antelope II South Tract Mining Plan Modification last week under the direction of the Trump administration, which is “delivering on its promise to revitalize American coal and unleash our nation’s energy potential,” Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum said in a prepared statement. 
The newly accessible 14.5 million tons of coal will allow the Antelope mine to continue its progression westward toward Highway 59 in Converse County. The mine, operated by Navajo Transitional Energy Company, produces 20-25 million tons of coal annually and employs about 400 miners, according to the company. It’s the third-largest coal mine in the nation in terms of production, federal records show.
The action is in line with President Donald Trump’s executive orders to “reinvigorate” the U.S. coal industry, according to administration officials. “As global instability continues to threaten energy markets, the need for reliable, domestic coal has never been clearer,” Acting Assistant Secretary for Land and Mineral Management Adam Suess said in a prepared statement. “This action underscores our commitment to commonsense permitting, environmental stewardship and energy dominance.”

In addition to unlocking a backlog of federal coal mining plans, the Big Beautiful Bill helps the industry, administration officials say, by lowering its federal mineral royalty from 12.5% to 7% — an estimated $50 million annual revenue loss to the state of Wyoming. Generally, federal mineral royalties are split 50-50 between the feds and the government of the state in which the mineral production took place, but state lawmakers have asked that Wyoming receive a larger slice of that pie given the projected revenue loss.
More coal leasing to come
The Antelope mine expansion technically could have been approved under the Biden administration’s ban on new federal coal leasing in the Powder River Basin because the mine had already obtained the coal lease and its proposed mining plan was initiated before the 2024 “no future coal leasing” plan for the region, according to industry officials. But action on the new mining plan had basically stalled out under the previous administration, according to Wyoming Mining Association Executive Director Travis Deti.

“This particular [Antelope mine lease action] has been pending with the Office of Surface Mining for some time,” Deti told WyoFile via email. “While it technically could have happened under Biden, the agency basically stopped all work on program amendments during his term. Language passed in the Big Beautiful Bill directs the Secretary of the Interior to expedite existing leasing action, and so it’s refreshing to finally see some movement.”
Gov. Mark Gordon hailed the Trump administration for taking action on a coal mining plan that lingered under Biden, and said he eagerly awaits approval of another stalled plan in southwest Wyoming.
“While this announcement is a positive step forward, we are also keenly aware of a pending decision on the Black Butte Mine expansion in Sweetwater County, which was also halted by the previous administration,” Gordon said in a prepared statement.
The Interior on Monday launched a 10-day public comment period for Black Butte’s proposed “mining plan modification,” which would tap an additional 9.2 million tons of federal coal. A public meeting will be held virtually from 5:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. on Aug. 18. Visit this federal website and click on the Black Butte tab for more information about the meeting and how to submit a comment. 
Meantime, the U.S. Bureau of Land Management plans to amend resource management plans for its Buffalo and Miles City, Montana, field offices to undo Biden’s leasing ban in the Powder River Basin, which spans northeast Wyoming and southern Montana, and to “identify areas that may be suitable for future coal leasing.”
Wyoming coal production has ticked up slightly so far this year after dipping below 200 million tons last year for the first time in decades, according to federal data.

The Iowa Board of Nursing recently found that an unlicensed nurse worked at the agency and that ""fraudulent practices"" occurred there related to billing and records. Those findings are now being appealed to district court. (Building photo via Google Earth; document excerpt from the Iowa Board of Nursing) A state agency that denied having inspection records for a Cedar Rapids home health agency now admits it has the records but considers them confidential.
The records are related to Compassion North America, a home health agency whose practices came under scrutiny earlier this year after the Iowa Board of Nursing presented evidence of falsified records, billing for services that were never delivered, and the employment of an unlicensed nurse to provide patient care.
On July 9, the Iowa Capital Dispatch asked the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing for a copy of a private accreditation agency’s inspection report for Compassion North America.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
In response to the Capital Dispatch’s request, DIAL spokesperson Diane McCool said DIAL “does not receive survey reports,” using DIAL’s terminology for inspectors’ reports, from accrediting organizations.
After the Capital Dispatch reported DIAL’s claim that it didn’t have the requested records, the Accreditation Commission for Health Care contacted the news organization and said that it had, in fact, provided DIAL with a copy of the documents via email on Sept. 16, 2024.
The Capital Dispatch asked DIAL again for the records, and also requested email communications between the accrediting organization and the state agency.
Last week, DIAL provided the Capital Dispatch with the Sept. 16, 2024, email. The email included no text other than the subject line, and DIAL refused to disclose the email’s attached accreditation report, stating that DIAL was not the “official” custodian of that particular document.
DIAL didn’t explain its initial assertion that it didn’t have the records, nor did it explain how it could be the custodian of an email but not the attachment to that email.
State: Home health agencies aren’t licensed
The Capital Dispatch had also asked DIAL how and when Compassion North America was first licensed by the state, noting that the state agency’s website indicated the company was first licensed in September 2024 — seven years after the company was formed.
In response, McCool said on July 8 that “Compassion North America became certified and licensed to provide medical home health services on Sept. 12, 2024.”
Later, however, DIAL removed that “initial licensing date” from its website. When asked why that happened, McCool said, “Since there is no license for any HHA (home health agency) in the state, we removed the license date. This is consistent with department practice.”
Her statement did not address her previous assertion that Compassion North America was certified and licensed last September.
Because DIAL has never conducted its own inspection of Compassion North America, and because it won’t release its copy of the accrediting commission’s findings, there is no public record of any regulatory oversight of the home health provider, which was first incorporated in June 2017.
No DIAL investigation of allegations
Last month, McCool said DIAL was not currently investigating Compassion North America, despite the findings of the Board of Nursing and its investigator that the company appeared to have falsified records, billed for services that were never delivered, and employed an unlicensed nurse to provide patient care.
Those allegations surfaced at a disciplinary hearing for registered nurse M’balu Madlene Kebbie, who is married to Compassion North America’s CEO, Joseph Lemor.
A state investigator who reviewed the work schedules of Compassion employees as part of a board investigation allegedly found that the license of one of the company’s nurses had expired in January 2021 but she had continued to provide patient care in June and July 2022.
In addition, a comparison of Compassion’s billing records with the staff work schedule allegedly showed the company had submitted payment claims for services for which there was no corresponding documentation to indicate the care was provided. There were also payment claims for services provided by a registered nurse that exceeded 24 hours in a single day, the state investigator testified.
According to the board, Kebbie had no explanation for the irregularities in the nursing documentation — including instances where it appeared Compassion had billed Medicaid twice for some services.
Citing what it called Kebbie’s “lack of previous disciplinary history,” the board ruled that she could retain her Iowa nursing license subject to two years of probation. However, the board’s own records indicate that in 2012, it disciplined Kebbie for working as a nurse while her license was inactive.
Kebbie’s attorney has filed an appeal of the board’s recent decision in Polk County District Court, arguing the sanctions against her are “unreasonable, arbitrary, and excessive.” The state has denied any wrongdoing in the matter.
Lemor has said the state is engaged in a “witch hunt” with regard to Kebbie.  “We did not do anything improper,” he told the Iowa Capital Dispatch last month. “We have nothing to hide.”

The student, Aleysha Ortiz, graduated from Hartford Public Schools last year despite never learning to read or write. Last summer, she spoke to The Connecticut Mirror about her time in the school district, which she entered when she was 6 years old.
[This Hartford Public High School grad can’t read. Here’s how it happened.]
Shortly after her story went public, Ortiz filed her lawsuit. The lawsuit, however, doesn’t seek damages related to her educational attainment. Rather, it focuses on the emotional harm that was allegedly done to Ortiz during her years in the Hartford school district, including by case manager Tilda Santiago.
The complaint alleges that Santiago belittled, stalked and harassed Ortiz in front of other students and teachers. Ortiz went to other teachers in tears and emotional distress as a result, according to the complaint, which also states that Ortiz reported Santiago’s conduct to the principal and assistant principal.
The courtroom arguments on Monday before Superior Court Judge Matthew Gordon focused on two questions: whether the allegations in Ortiz’s complaint were significant enough to prove negligent infliction of emotional distress, and whether the actions of school employees were “ministerial,” meaning the parties were required by law to follow certain procedures but failed to do so. Attorneys representing the city, school board and Santiago argued that their decisions were not ministerial but rather discretionary, meaning they were not legally required to act in a certain way but were rather making decisions based on personal judgment.
Ortiz’s attorney, Anthony Spinella, argued that employees in the district were required by law to follow certain procedures, like reporting bullying to a school administrator, and failed to do so.
“Any school employee who gets a report of bullying has to notify the administrator, full stop. No evaluation, no discretion. They have to file a written report. The policy has to require this safe school climate specialist to investigate or supervise investigation ofall reports of bullying,” Spinella said. “We believe that immunity does not apply because we allege violation of ministerialities.” 
Gordon did not make a decision on the motion on Monday. If Gordon rules in favor of attorneys representing Hartford, the school district and Santiago, Spinella said he would appeal the decision. 
Ortiz is seeking $3 million in damages. Last month, Spinella offered to settle the lawsuit for that amount with the school district and the city.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024_0711_SR__AleyshaUConn_0198-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-11 16:57:03.926001

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Campaign funds can be used for officeholder security expenses in certain cases, the Oklahoma Ethics Commission recommended in a draft advisory opinion. 
Any “reasonable” expenses must be the direct result of holding the elected state office and would not be incurred if the individual did not hold the office, the draft opinion read. The opinion only covers the officeholder, not family, staff or others connected with the individual. 
The Ethics Commission is expected to hear public comment on the draft opinion at its meeting Thursday ahead of any vote to finalize the opinion. 
“The officeholder must need security to respond to dangers or threats related to the office held, and not simply for security that any member of the public would need,” the draft opinion said. 
“Further, the dangers or threats are related not just to any elected office within the State of Oklahoma, but the office held by that elected official.”
Security expenses must be a direct result of holding a state office. 
“If the expense would exist with or without the elected office, it does not pass the but-for test,” the opinion reads. 
The test refers to an analysis used by the Ethics Commission for officeholder expenses. The test determines whether the expense would be incurred “but for the fact that they were elected to state office.” 
The Federal Election Commission previously issued guidance which allows campaign funds to be used to pay for certain security devices and services to address ongoing dangers and threats. 
The commission voted July 10 to provide an advisory opinion at the request of Senate President Pro Tem Lonnie Paxton, R-Tuttle, House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow, Senate Minority Leader Julia Kirt, D-Oklahoma City and House Minority Leader Cyndi Munson, D-Oklahoma City. 
Kirt and Munson said they were pleased and encouraged by the draft opinion. 
“Tragic events this past year have left many lawmakers fearful for their safety,” Munson said in a statement Monday. “All public servants should have the support they need in order to best serve their communities. When we are unencumbered by threats made to our personal security, we can ensure a better, more prosperous future for everyone.” 
The request from lawmakers came in the wake of the June assassination of top Minnesota lawmaker, Melissa Hortman. 
Hortman, a member of the Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party and House Speaker Emerita, and her husband, Mark Hortman, were assassinated in their home. 
Authorities allege Vance Boelter, 57, posed as a police officer to gain entrance to their home and shot and killed the couple. 
He’s also accused of shooting Minnesota state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife that same night. Hoffman was released from the hospital. He and his wife are recovering. 
Boelter was arrested and faces state and federal charges, some of which carry the potential for the death penalty. 
Investigators said he had a list of other potential targets, including other Democratic elected officials. 
The assassinations have led to public officials across the U.S. feeling on edge and weighing the cost of public service. 
“It’s a privilege to be able to serve our fellow Oklahomans in public office, but the unfortunate reality is, we have seen that service can come with great risk to elected officials and their loved ones,” Kirt said in a statement Monday.

(Getty Images)The Indiana Court of Appeals on Monday affirmed a ruling by a trial court judge upholding the state’s near-total abortion ban, specifically provisions relating to medical providers and potential exemptions. 
The law, which was enacted in a special 2022 session, only allows for exceptions in the case of a mother’s health, rape or incest, or a fatal fetal anomaly — though each with varying time limits. 
Plaintiffs argued that certain pregnancies could imperil the health of the mother, but providers could be afraid to pursue an abortion for fear of the repercussions. Additionally, the law limits all abortion care to hospitals or an ambulatory surgical center, rather than the free-standing clinics who largely performed these reproductive health procedures prior to the ban.

“The circumstances argued by the medical-care providers here generally do not necessitate an abortion to treat those risks,” ruled the panel of judges. “… because the constitutional right to an abortion requires an extreme medical scenario where the woman’s life or health is at serious risk, performing a constitutionally protected abortion in Indiana is a procedure that nearly always will be done in a hospital.
“Thus, the statutory Hospital Requirement is not a material burden on the constitutional right to an abortion.”
Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita congratulated the members of his team that argued the case and said “This ruling is a resounding victory for life and the rule of law in Indiana,” Attorney General Rokita said. “Our unwavering commitment to protecting the most vulnerable and upholding our state’s values will continue to guide this office. The overwhelming majority of Hoosiers stand with us in defending the sanctity of life and the health of women across our state.”
The underlying abortion case initially centered on the risk to the health of the mother and the rights of providers, delaying the implementation of Indiana’s ban by roughly one year. After an Indiana Supreme Court ruling in favor of the state’s ban — though left the door open for future challenges — plaintiffs, represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana, amended their complaint to narrow their focus.
That amended version is the one that the Indiana Court of Appeals weighed on Monday.
Another challenge, regarding whether Indiana’s ban violates its religious freedom law, is ongoing.

With the new complaint system, the Public Access Counselor Unit will review requests and offer mediation services, according to a news release. After receiving the complaint, the unit has 60 days to work with both parties to ensure compliance with Oklahoma’s Open Records Act.
Anthony Sykes is named as the public access counselor, according to the complaint portal. 
Gov. Kevin Stitt vetoed the bill because he said the measure would give Attorney General Gentner Drummond “sweeping and unchecked authority” to access records from all state agencies, an “unprecedented” power in Oklahoma. Lawmakers overturned the veto.

Circuit in an opinion filed Saturday denied the Trump administration’s request to halt a lower court’s ruling that required it to once again post information about spending decisions called apportionments.The 27-page opinion, written by Circuit Judge Karen LeCraft Henderson, said that to “grant the Executive a stay pending appeal in this separation-of-powers standoff would effectively cut the Congress’s purse strings.”“No President would allow a usurper to command our armed forces.

Bush, a few years after then-President Ronald Reagan nominated her as a federal district judge in 1986.Cerin Lindgrensavage, counsel for Protect Democracy Project, one of the organizations that filed the lawsuit, released a statement cheering the Circuit Court’s decision.“Restoration of this website could not have come at a more important time — over the last two weeks journalists have broken story after story of OMB holding back funds using apportionment footnotes — and once this website goes back online we should all have a chance to learn where else OMB has been holding up money that — under law — should be spent,” Lindgrensavage wrote.The Office of Management and Budget did not immediately respond to a request for comment from States Newsroom on Monday.

Rosemary Bayer speaks at a press conference demanding gun control legislation on Feb. 20, 2023, one week after a mass shooting on the campus of Michigan State University. (Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)Democratic State Sen. Rosemary Bayer of West Bloomfield announced Monday that she will not seek reelection in what will be a key state Senate district in the 2026 contest.
Bayer has served two terms in the Senate, and was first elected in 2018 representing the state’s former 12th District. The state’s lines were redrawn in 2021 by the Michigan Independent Citizens Redistricting Commission and Bayer was moved to a new 13th District, which was previously represented by state Sen. Mallory McMorrow (D-Royal Oak). A winding lawsuit against the commission’s maps ended in the body redrawing the state’s lines once more in 2024 and again changed Bayer’s district.
Despite those challenges, Bayer won in the newly redrawn district, and immediately embraced her new territory. With new changes to term limits for the Michigan Legislature, Bayer had to weigh whether a third run was in the cards and was on the fence about seeking reelection.
On Monday, Bayer told Michigan Advance that it was time to retire.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“I was retired before I started this job,” Bayer said. “This was sort of a second act, which was really fun. I got to do something totally different and amazing, but I was already old when I got here. When I first decided to run, I knew the work that I wanted to do was going to take more than four years, so I committed to the eight-year thing. Then they changed it. I didn’t really change, I stayed with the plan, and now it’s time for me to retire.”
That said, Bayer said she will miss the work and the people she’s represented in the Legislature’s upper chamber for nearly a decade.
In a news release announcing her decision, the Senate Democratic Caucus noted that Bayer’s strong desire to improve the state’s educational system motivated her to seek office in 2018 and became one of her top priorities in the Senate, followed by protecting the state’s waters and to help those needing vital mental health care. She viewed her candidacy as a chance to help people in significant ways, and accomplished many of her stated goals.
The caucus noted her work on regulating firearms, collaborating to pass key gun safety legislation that became law in 2023.
Bayer told the Advance that she was floored by the level of inequities in the education system and worked tirelessly to get the state to an equal footing before pushing onward to ensure students of all stripes had what they needed to succeed.
When Democrats gained the majority in the Senate following the 2022 election,  Bayer said she and other education-focused senators managed to create a real model for equity in school funding.
Although budget talks have stalled out between the House and the Senate, Bayer said that her first four years in the minority showed her that both political aisles can work together and did so in the past to ensure schools had the money they needed, and increased the budget in a time of Republican control.
“We took a few more steps when we had our trifecta going strong, but we did a lot before that, working with Republicans,” Bayer said. “I know this thing where we’re stuck right now … it’s not really us collectively. So there’s a bit of frustration on our side. We keep trying to be the grown ups in the room and doing the right thing.”
Bayer said she and her colleagues are resolved to getting a budget done soon that works not only for the whole state but one that continues the hard work she’s put into education through her tenure in the Senate.
“Our job is to take care of Michigan,” Bayer said.
With a new competitive district like the 13th Senate seat now wide open for the taking, Bayer’s advice to her eventual successor  – whom she hopes will be a Democrat – was not complicated.
“It’s always the same: go talk to the people,” Bayer said.
Just because Bayer’s not seeking reelection doesn’t mean the goodbyes should start early, either.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)The U.S. Coast Guard commissioned its first additional polar icebreaker in 25 years in Juneau on Sunday, marking what officials called a new era in Arctic activity for the United States.
The newly rechristened Storis, formerly the oilfield supply ship Aiviq, is the first in a series of icebreakers expected to join the Coast Guard in coming years. The Storis and subsequent ships, officials said, are critical for the United States to maintain its sovereignty and control of its borders in and near the Arctic Ocean.
“What we’re doing here today is we’re really just preparing to build our Arctic fighting force,” said Troy Edgar, deputy undersecretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, parent agency of the Coast Guard.

U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, was one of several members of Congress who secured funding for the Coast Guard to purchase the Storis for $125 million under a special contract and operating arrangement during the Biden administration. The purchase deal passed Congress after years of lobbying and political donations by the ship’s former owners.
The Aiviq, built to support Royal Dutch Shell’s oil drilling operations in the Arctic Ocean off Alaska, was available because of a disaster that saw Shell’s drilling rig break loose from the Aiviq during a 2013 storm in the Gulf of Alaska. The rig ran aground in the Kodiak archipelago and Shell abandoned its drill plans for the Arctic.
The Aiviq was modified after post-disaster reviews found flaws in its design, and it went on to serve under contract with the Australian government in Antarctica. Then, the U.S. government became interested in the ship to fill a gap in Arctic coverage.
The U.S. Navy has no icebreakers, which leaves the Coast Guard as the agency in charge of icebreaking operations, critical for opening frozen seas to commerce, research and military missions. The agency currently has just one heavy icebreaker, and that ship is typically assigned to help operations in Antarctica. That leaves the medium icebreaker Healy as the only U.S. icebreaker available for general-purpose missions in the Arctic.
A 2023 analysis by the Coast Guard concluded that the service needs eight to nine polar icebreakers, including four or five heavy ships and four or five medium ones to perform its assigned missions.
“I think Singapore has more icebreaking capacity than we do,” Sullivan said. “That has left us far behind our adversaries. Russia has more than 50 operational icebreakers, many nuclear-powered, many weaponized. China, which has no Arctic territory, is building a polar fleet and is spending a lot of time off our shores, including this summer.”

As Sullivan spoke, China is operating at least five research icebreakers in international waters near Alaska.
Capt. Corey Kerns is the ship’s first commanding officer, fresh from an assignment in Japan as a liaison officer with the U.S. Navy’s Seventh Fleet.
“For the Coast Guard, the big strategic thing is to show that we can operate it, get it up north, show the flag,” Kerns said.
During his time in Japan, he became familiar with the disputes over the Senkaku Islands, whose ownership is disputed among China, Taiwan and Japan.
Ships from all three nations visit the waters around those islands.
“The ability to be present guarantees your ability to to maintain sovereignty. And that’s what we’re trying to get at here in the Arctic. We need more icebreakers to be present in our waters and be clear what is our waters,” he said.
 First of many icebreakers planned for Coast Guard

In January, President Donald Trump said he would seek to acquire 40 Coast Guard icebreakers. The “Big Beautiful Bill” signed by Trump in July included almost $9 billion to build a series of heavy, medium and light ships.
Those include a series of heavy Arctic icebreakers larger than the Storis. The first of those, the Polar Sentinel, is expected to come from Bollinger Mississippi Shipbuilding in 2030, with additional ships every two years afterward.
“This is an amazing moment, because it doesn’t happen that often, but it’s going to be happening a lot more,” said acting Coast Guard Commandant Adm. Kevin E. Lunday.

The Storis is scheduled to be homeported in Juneau, where Sunday’s commissioning took place, but not for several years. For the time being, it will be homeported in Seattle, Washington.
Sullivan, speaking at the commissioning, said he would like to see the new ships homeported in Alaska as well — it’s where the ice is, he said to applause.
The Trump-signed budget measure includes $300 million for a new Coast Guard pier and other facilities in Juneau; construction has not begun, and no site has been finalized.
Both the Storis and the under-construction heavy icebreakers are too large to fit in the Coast Guard’s Kodiak base or in any port north of the Aleutian Islands. The Storis draws 34 feet, according to specifications published in 2013. The new heavy icebreakers are expected to have a similar draft. Either figure is deeper than what’s available in northern Alaska right now.
By the book, said Cmdr. Philip Baxa, chief of the Coast Guard’s aids to navigation and ice capabilities division, it takes the Coast Guard eight to 10 years to set up a new port from the time it’s chosen.
“We want to move much faster, but there’s a lot of work that has to be done to build out the pier and the shore infrastructure,” Lunday said.
He said things like housing and child care need to be available to accommodate Coast Guard personnel.
Currently, Juneau is experiencing major shortages of both.
“I chair the Coast Guard subcommittee,” Sullivan said, “so working with the Coast Guard, working with Juneau, working with the state, we’re going to press this. We’ve already made good progress on that.”
 Additional work needed aboard Storis

The Storis, too, will need work and testing before it can fully perform its duties. During a pre-commissioning cruise on Saturday for members of the media and the families of the crew, one of the ship’s variable-pitch propellers malfunctioned, helping turn a planned five-hour excursion into an eight-hour one.
The malfunction was a minor one, but fixing it may have required turning off main power for a time, the ship’s captain said, and he didn’t want to do that while families were aboard.
The Storis has a helipad, but a Coast Guard helicopter has never landed there, tried a mid-air hoist, or refueled from the ship. Some labels throughout the ship still bear the name Aiviq, and the ship’s interior art includes photos from Louisiana bayous and New Orleans streets. In the ship’s mess hall are condiments bearing the names of southern grocery stores.

On Saturday’s cruise, employees from Edison Chouest Offshore, the company that formerly owned the Storis, stood alongside uniformed Coast Guard officers on the ship’s bridge.
“He’s my coach,” said Lt. j.g. Sophia Scott of chief mate Devin Keister, who wore civilian clothes next to her.
Since the spring, employees from Edison Chouest have been operating the Storis alongside enlisted Coast Guard members and officers, a unique setup for a Coast Guard ship.
Baxa, chief of the Coast Guard’s aids to navigation and ice capabilities division, helped organize the purchase of the Storis and the sprint to get it ready.
“I’ll never forget March 4 of 2025 when Admiral Lunday, our acting Commandant of the Coast Guard, directed me and my team to prepare Storis for operations and to sail away from Pascagoula, Mississippi, where the ship had been purchased and put into storage, no later than 1 June of 2025. I’m no mathematician, but that’s less than 60 days later, and at that point, zero crew members had reported aboard,” he said.
After sailing away, the ship spent another two weeks in Seattle for additional work, then arrived in Juneau during the first week of August.
Lunday said the Coast Guard’s partnership with Edison Chouest enabled the Coast Guard to put the Storis in service “much faster than we would have traditionally done.”
“The imperative,” Lunday said, “is that we build out the nation’s icebreaker fleet. When we see the potential adversaries that are moving to build their icebreakers, we’ve got to move faster as the United States, and we’re going to do that. … The original plan was not to have Storis up here for another year, but the national imperative was to move faster, and so that’s why it’s here.”
 Storis has a mixed history

In 2012, while towing the circular drill rig Kulluk from the Arctic Ocean to Seattle, the Aiviq ran into a heavy storm south of Kodiak. The ship’s engines died, the tow line broke, and the Kulluk ran aground after the Aiviq’s crew was unable to re-establish the tow.
No oil spill resulted and no one was injured, but it contributed to Shell’s decision to abandon its Arctic drilling plans.
Two years later, the Coast Guard published a report on the accident, concluding that actions by the tow crew, management decisions and “design engineering deficiencies … relating to the Aiviq” contributed to the wreck.

Specifically, the report noted that vents allowed seawater to contaminate the ship’s fuel.
Since then, those vents have been modified, raised farther above the deck, and the ship went on to conduct two successful voyages to Antarctica. The ship is rated to break three feet of ice while moving at five knots, but during those trips, it was able to break between three and five feet while still moving forward, Baxa said.
After Shell discontinued its Alaska offshore drilling, Edison Chouest lobbied members of Congress and urged lawmakers to purchase the Aiviq for use by the federal government.
The Coast Guard initially resisted. In a 2016 hearing of the U.S. House’s Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Subcommittee, then-Coast Guard Vice Commandant Charles Michel told lawmakers that “our current opinion is that the ship is not suitable for military service, without substantial refit.”
Then-Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska, called Michel’s statement a “bulls**t answer” because the Aiviq would be asked to move ice, not perform military duties.
In 2022, after Young’s death in office, Congress passed the Don Young Coast Guard Authorization Act, which approved funding for the Coast Guard to buy a “United States built available icebreaker.”
The Coast Guard, which had been considering a Finland-built ship, switched to the Aiviq as the only available ship that met Congress’ qualifications.
Subsequent reporting by ProPublica showed an extensive history of political donations by Edison Chouest to members of Congress, including Alaska’s delegation.
“It is ready for Coast Guard service,” Lunday said of the Aiviq-turned-Storis when asked about the July 2016 hearing that labeled the Aiviq as unfit.
“We’ve learned a lot since then, and we’ve had great support from Congress to have the appropriations necessary last year to purchase the ship,” he said.
Sullivan, among the members of Congress who received contributions from Edison Chouest, denied that those donations contributed to the decision to purchase the Aiviq.
“It has nothing to do with it,” Sullivan said. “Zero. I’ve been pressing for more icebreakers any way possible for our country … and the Coast Guard was looking at the idea of a commercially available one.”
 New ship carries relics of prior history

The new Storis is named after its predecessor, an icebreaker that was commissioned in 1942 and served until 2007, becoming the oldest commissioned Coast Guard cutter in the fleet at the time of its decommissioning and scrapping.
In 1957, it and several other ships sailed through the Northwest Passage, marking the first time an American ship had taken that route.
Thirty-two years after that historic voyage, the Storis assisted with the cleanup after the Exxon Valdez oil spill. Ed Sasser was a crewman on board at the time. On Saturday, he sailed aboard the new edition of his former ship.
“It’s pretty cushy compared to the old Storis,” he said, noting that both ships were and are unique vessels, not part of a larger class of ships.
If he were young again, he’d serve aboard the new ship “in a New York minute.”
“Time will tell how useful it is,” he said.

Remnants of the ship’s former life remain obvious throughout.
Belowdecks are large steel containers, intended to haul bulk dry concrete or other material to offshore oil fields. For now, they’re empty until the Coast Guard either removes them or finds a use for them.
Other pieces of the Storis’ original purpose could be useful to its new mission. Its stern holds heavy-duty towing gear, and large firefighting cannons jut from its superstructure.
The ship has no internal laboratory space, as does the Coast Guard’s other medium icebreaker, the Healy, but it does have deck attachments for container modules that could allow it to accommodate labs.
Already, one of those spaces was in use Sunday, holding the ship’s brand-new armory, including four .50-caliber machine guns.
“I’ve made this joke for many, many years … it’s that if you can imagine it, and you can put it into a standard 20-foot IMO container, I can embark it on board. … we had on board a very, very senior Marine Corps officer, and he asked, ‘hey, what if I put a Marine Raider team in a box?’ I said, ‘Yes, sir, I can embark that on board.’ It really does provide that flexibility for missions,” Baxa said.
The Coast Guard’s staffing contract with Edison Chouest is scheduled to run through November, and it could be extended for one year.
Both Baxa and the ship’s captain said they’ll be recommending that extension.
Lt. Cmdr. George Greendyk, the engineer officer on board the Storis, said he hasn’t had problems with the Edison Chouest civilian crew.
“Everywhere we go, we have people that have seen something like this before, and they’ve been certainly helpful answering questions for us and guiding us as we run the engineering plant,” he said.
“Right now, our primary mission is to just focus on learning the ship, training, preparing our policy and procedures,” said Lt. D.J. Corbett, the ship’s operations officer.
Corbett said that over the next two months, the Storis will head west, to Kodiak, then through the Bering Sea and north, through the Bering Strait. The ship’s port calls are still being finalized.
Corbett said being aboard an icebreaker means being able to see and do things that no other Coast Guard cutter experiences.
“I still remember the first time that I ever saw ice,” she said. “We were going down south. We had crossed the Antarctic Circle, and all of these massive icebergs just started flowing past us. And then we had right whales that were popping up and coming to see the ship. We had orcas. It was our last sunset. As we were heading south, it would be 24 hours of sunlight. So all of this was happening, the sun was setting, and then we saw a green flash that night. At first, we didn’t believe it. We were like, Did everyone see that? And so it was my moment of, I’m living in a National Geographic special. It was really amazing.”
 The ship’s first captain looks ahead

Kearns, the ship’s first captain, is an officer who started as an enlisted man in 1996 and rose through the ranks, later earning degrees in ship design. He helped design a new class of icebreakers for the Great Lakes and served as the Coast Guard’s liaison to the U.S. Navy’s Seventh Fleet, which patrols the western Pacific.

“Normally, you start off a ship designed by (the question): What capabilities are you trying to achieve? In this case, we need Arctic presence. That was the most important thing. So we’re willing to take some risk or we’re forced into it because our shipbuilding projects are so behind,” he said.
Critically for the ship’s future, he said, is to come up with the equivalent of the ship’s operating manual. Coast Guard officers are trained to run ships, but the Storis is unique.
“What are all the things you need to learn to do the same job on Storis? And then run all of our people through that. … I think success will be when we get all of that documentation done and then get all of our watchstanders what would be considered fully qualified,” he said.
Kerns acknowledged that there are some people who would prefer that the Storis jump quickly into law enforcement, fisheries patrols and search and rescue. He prefers a slower pace.
“We need to learn how to crawl. And that’s what we’re doing, Kerns said.
For example, the crew of the Storis hasn’t yet launched the ship’s small craft, which are stored in bays along the side of the hull, in open water.
“We’ve just started to gain proficiency in launching that in protected, calm seas. So next would be, what does it look like to launch that in open water? And then how do we need to drive the ship from the bridge to create the right conditions to safely launch that boat? And then that would help us build into, ‘Oh, this is how we would  perform Coast Guard mission sets.’”
Asked about the ship’s history, the critical 2014 report and whether he has safety concerns, he said no.
“I have no concerns. I feel totally safe on Storis,” Kerns said.
He said he’s familiar with reporting that analyzed what went wrong with the Aiviq and why it was unable to keep the Kulluk from running aground.
“It easily gets attributed to design flaws for the ship, which is a little bit misleading. In extreme weather, every ship has design flaws. There’s constraints on operations. Ships are designed to operate in certain conditions to a certain extent, and if you operate the ship past those constraints, you’re going to find out what’s going to fail first,” he said.
Some engineering changes were made after the Kulluk accident — the Aiviq’s fuel vents were raised, “which means you can take more water in the vicinity of them before it would down-flood. It’s not that it couldn’t possibly happen again, but it’s less likely.”
Kerns said the “creature comforts” aboard the ship are the most easily noticeable difference from a purpose-built Coast Guard ship.
The Storis has heated handrails, walkways and exterior stairs, a feature intended to eliminate the need for crew to beat ice away as it forms.
“There’s a lot of automation in places that we might not use it, because we use manpower instead,” he said.
Kerns said he’s also been impressed with the ship’s multiple redundancies.
“Almost every system has backups to the backups. They really thought about this thing being in the Arctic and independent and away from logistical support. There’s different ways to make water. There’s ways to handle sewage. I actually feel very comfortable with what the capabilities are,” he said.
“I’m definitely looking forward to doing ice breaking on this thing. It’s a lot of fun to drive,” Kerns said.

(Will McLelland/Alabama Reflector)Attorneys representing the University of Alabama (UA) system in a lawsuit challenging Alabama’s 2024 state law banning diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives and so-called “divisive concepts” claimed in court filings that new federal guidance on anti-discrimination laws would make it unlawful for UA to reopen open spaces dedicated to minority students, likening it to “unlawful segregation.”
In a brief filed Tuesday last week, attorneys for the university cited a July memorandum from U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, claiming that DEI initiatives can be considered discriminatory and may be in violation of federal anti-discrimination laws.
“The guidance states that it would be an unlawful practice for ‘[a] university’s DEI initiative [to designate] a ‘safe space’ or lounge exclusively for students of a specific racial or ethnic group,’ … and that ‘[e]ven if access is technically open to all, the identity-based focus creates a perception of segregation and may foster a hostile environment’ in violation of federal antidiscrimination laws,” the attorneys wrote, quoting the Trump administration’s guidance.

The lawsuit, brought by professors and students in the University of Alabama system against Gov. Kay Ivey and the university system Board of Trustees, alleges that SB 129 stifled instructional activity and violated the First and Fourteenth Amendment rights. The anti-DEI law bans public funding for diversity and inclusion initiatives and the teaching of so-called “divisive concepts,” such as people of one race being “inherently responsible” for past crimes committed by members of that race.
UA professor alleges lawmaker threatened honors program budget over anti-DEI law

In July 2024, ahead of the anti-DEI law’s implementation, the UA system announced it planned to close the schools’ DEI offices and replace them with offices that seemingly addressed similar goals. Later in August, UA closed its Black Student Union and Safe Zone, its LGBTQ+ resource center, citing compliance with SB 129.
UA attorneys wrote that the guidance “speaks directly” to officials’ concerns about reinstating Black Student Union and Safe Zone offices in the UA Student Center; UA’s Division of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion; University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB)’s Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion; and UAB’s Student Multicultural and Diversity Programs office.
Attorneys from the NAACP Legal Defense & Educational Fund and the ACLU of Alabama representing the plaintiffs in the lawsuit argued in a filing Monday that the guidance is irrelevant, stating that the memorandum is nothing more than “non-binding suggestions.”
“The fact that the board defendants now believe they could support the closure based on some other law (an argument they did not introduce until after the evidentiary hearing) does not undermine standing or otherwise avoid adjudication of whether the closures pursuant to SB 129 were unconstitutional,” attorneys for the plaintiffs wrote.
The attorneys also wrote that it was “undisputed” that the Black Student Union and Safe Zone spaces were open to all students and “did not limit use based on race, gender, sexual orientation, or any other characteristic.”
“There is not a shred of evidence in the record that either the BSU space or the Safe Zone created a perception of segregation or fostered a hostile environment.  The guidance simply has no application to the case actually before this Court,” plaintiff’s counsel stated.
Plaintiffs said at a two-day evidentiary hearing in June that SB 129 was vaguely written, threatened the teaching of Black history in schools, chilled academic freedom and ultimately led to threats of budget cuts to an honors program from one state representative.
U.S. District Judge David Proctor indicated in June he wanted to decide whether to issue an injunction before the start of the fall semester. Classes start on August 20 at UA and August 25 at UAB.
In briefs filed after hearings in late June and early July, plaintiffs argued that a new law is leading to “viewpoint discrimination,” claiming that professors, fearing enforcement, have to “self-censor” and change their teaching methods. One professor, Dana Patton, testified she was investigated after an anonymous complaint and warned by Rep. Danny Garrett, R-Trussville, that lawmakers wouldn’t “let this go.”
The Alabama Attorney General’s office, representing Gov. Kay Ivey, argued in their post-hearing brief that these fears aren’t “objectively reasonable” since the professors stated they don’t intend to violate the law.

The whole community owes profound thanks to the activists who have exposed the plight of people who are being forcibly removed from Vermont by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. 
It is welcome news that the Burlington airport’s director of aviation, Nic Longo, and Mayor Emma Mulvaney-Stanak are seeking ways to ensure that everyone who is being moved through our airport has access to legal assistance. We can be proud that Gov. Phil Scott reportedly has said that his administration will support efforts to ensure that everyone detained in our state is treated fairly and afforded due process under the law.

As the author of a book on the Dutch resistance, I know the public officials we honor today are not those who said they couldn’t do anything about the deportations. Instead, they are the ones who looked for every possible method they might use to slow the monstrous mechanism down even a little. 
Now it’s up to Vermont to treat people as we would wish to be treated — whether by asking every person whether they are flying of their own free will, making sure they have access to an attorney, enforcing parking policies for ICE vehicles, requiring that public doorways be used or other ways we haven’t imagined yet.  
This is your chance to do what you think you would have done in World War II. Let Scott, Mulvaney-Stanak and Longo know the community is behind them in doing the right thing.

Dillon’s work also figures indirectly in a modern-day lesson on how NOT to run a government.
This how-not-to-do-it tutorial occurred last week during a Jones County Board of Supervisors meeting. A similar lesson is playing out in Storm Lake to a growing audience of discontented residents there.
At the heart of this lesson is the simple command the Legislature adopted 50 years ago — that public business should take place in the open for all to see, not in secret. Lawmakers and the courts recognize that voters and taxpayers cannot understand and evaluate the basis and rationale for government decisions when elected leaders make them behind closed doors or based on undisclosed information.
But some officials trip over themselves to avoid the heat of the spotlight when considering controversial topics. It is not necessarily a desire to avoid controversies. Instead, some prefer to discuss and decide what to do in private for convenience or to avoid embarrassment.
How does Lyman Dillon, an obscure pioneer, figure into this issue of openness vs. secrecy? Let’s begin with a quick history lesson.
In 1839, the federal government hired the 39-year-old farmer from Cascade to construct the first road in the Iowa Territory. I use the term “construct” loosely. Dillon was paid $3 per mile to use his teams of oxen to plow a 90-mile-long path that would guide travelers between Dubuque and Iowa City.
The path was officially known as the Military Road. Unofficially, people called it Dillon’s Furrow. Today, his path carries mundane names, U.S. Highway 151 between Dubuque and Anamosa and Iowa Highway 1 from just west of Anamosa to Iowa City.
In 1887, the government built an iron bridge over the Wapsipinicon River at Anamosa to further aid travelers using Dillon’s Furrow. That bridge still stands, although it no longer carries travelers.
Some people in eastern Iowa, including the Anamosa City Council and 1,200 petition signers, want to preserve what is now called the Dillon Military Bridge as a historic centerpiece for a recreational hiking and biking trail. But members of the Jones County Board of Supervisors see the bridge as a big expense for taxpayers and want to cut it up for scrap.
I do not have a position on the keep-or-scrap question. But I do have an opinion on the process the county supervisors followed last week.
The board disregarded the spirit and letter of Iowa’s public meetings Iowa when it met behind closed doors to discuss the bridge question and the county’s Anamosa bridge agreement. When the public meeting resumed, the supervisors came down in favor of demolition and voted to dissolve their agreement with Anamosa.
They did this without allowing preservationists to observe or comment during the supervisors’ deliberations last week. In contrast, when the bridge issue came before the Anamosa City Council in June, about 70 people attended and spoke at length.
County Attorney Kristofer Lyons said the supervisors needed to close their meeting  because the bridge issue could end up in a lawsuit. Following his logic, government boards in Iowa could debate nearly every controversial issue in secret because there always is a chance someone might sue.
The litigation exemption to the public meetings law allows government boards and their lawyers to discuss legal strategy in a pending lawsuit or in a dispute that is headed to the courts. Neither applies at this point to the Dillon Military Bridge dispute.
As in Jones County, people in Storm Lake are frustrated by the lack of information about the financial health of King’s Pointe Resort, a hotel, resort and water park on the shore of Storm Lake. The city owns the property and contracts with an outside management company to run it.
Questions about the profitability of King’s Pointe arose when the latest city audit was made public. It reported the resort’s cash on hand has fallen by half in recent years. Expenses exceeded revenues in 2024, 2023, 2021 and 2020, the Storm Lake Times Pilot reported.
To answer the public’s questions about the resort finances, the newspaper asked for copies of the monthly profit and loss statements the management company must provide to city officials under their operating agreement. The city claimed those statements do not exist, and if they did, the Times Pilot or anyone else asking for them would have to pay a city fee to retrieve and copy the documents.
The Times Pilot wrote an editorial last week titled, “Fortress of secrecy.” The editorial said, “Storm Lake City Hall is stonewalling us so hard on basic public information it makes one think that an attempt is being made to obscure poor management.”
The editorial continued: “Government should not operate this way, but we have become accustomed to it. Secrecy has become official policy.”
But it should not be, not in Storm Lake, nor in Jones County. Not for bridges, nor for water slides and hotels.

,California,2025-08-11 19:36:23+00:00,CalMatters,2.300 ‘Dreamers’ de California están a punto de perder su cobertura médica,Ana B. Ibarra,,,,,https://calmatters.org/calmatters-en-espanol/2025/08/dreamers-perder-cobertura-medica/,La administración Trump revirtió una regla que permitía a los inmigrantes indocumentados que fueron traídos a los EE. UU. cuando eran niños comprar seguros de salud en los mercados de la Ley de Atención Médica Asequible.,"This article is also available in English. Read it here.
Menos de un año después de que a los “Dreamers” se les permitió por primera vez inscribirse en el seguro de salud de Covered California, los inmigrantes indocumentados que fueron traídos a los EE. UU. cuando eran niños están a punto de perder su cobertura médica.
 En California, esto significa que unos 2300 Dreamers deben buscar seguro médico en otro lugar o quedarse sin él una vez que su cobertura finalice a fin de mes. La decisión fue tomada por los Centros de Servicios de Medicare y Medicaid (CDS) federales, la agencia que supervisa los mercados de seguros.
El año pasado, la administración Biden actualizó la definición de “presente legalmente” para la Ley de Atención Médica Asequible  (ACA), de modo que los beneficiarios del programa de Acción Diferida para los Llegados en la Infancia (DACA), también conocidos como Dreamers, pudieran adquirir seguros a través de los mercados estatales y federales. La administración Trump revocó esa decisión en junio y fijó la entrada en vigor del cambio dos meses después.
La orden está “diseñada para estabilizar el grupo de riesgos, reducir las primas y reducir las inscripciones indebidas con el objetivo de mejorar la asequibilidad y el acceso a la atención médica, manteniendo al mismo tiempo la responsabilidad fiscal”, dijo la agencia en un comunicado anunciando los cambios en el mercado.
 La semana pasada, Covered California anunció que estaba trabajando para notificar a todos los beneficiarios de DACA que su último día de cobertura será el 31 de agosto y que les ayudará a explorar otras opciones de seguro.
 Desde su creación, la Ley de Atención Médica Asequible ha prohibido a los inmigrantes que residen ilegalmente en el país adquirir cobertura médica en el mercado de seguros médicos. Los beneficiarios de DACA, a quienes se les permite permanecer y trabajar legalmente en Estados Unidos gracias a un programa de 2012, se convirtieron en la excepción. 
 ‘Esperaba un resultado diferente’
 “Esta decisión es profundamente injusta para las personas trabajadoras y contribuyentes de California que confiaban en tener seguro médico para 2025, solo para que se lo quitaran ocho meses después”, declaró Jessica Altman, directora ejecutiva de Covered California. “Si bien esperábamos un resultado diferente para los beneficiarios de DACA, debemos cumplir con la ley federal”.
Sin el mercado de seguros, los Dreamers tendrán que buscar cobertura a través de un empleador o, si sus ingresos son lo suficientemente bajos, podrían calificar para Medi-Cal, el programa estatal de seguro médico para personas de bajos ingresos . Esto deja algunos Dreamers f en una situación difícil si ganan demasiado para calificar para Medi-Cal, pero no lo suficiente para pagar el precio completo de un plan de salud.
 El beneficio de inscribirse en un seguro a través de Covered California es acceder a asistencia financiera. Se estima que ampliar la cobertura a los beneficiarios de DACA en todo el país le costaría al gobierno federal entre $240 y $300 millones al año . 
 Efecto en el mercado
 Si bien el gobierno federal dijo que los recortes tienen como objetivo estabilizar el grupo de riesgos del seguro y ayudar a reducir las primas, los expertos dicen que eliminar la cobertura para los jóvenes (la mayoría de los Dreamers tienen menos de 36 años ) haría lo contrario.
 Esto se debe a que cuando las personas más jóvenes y saludables se inscriben en un seguro, su cobertura de bajo costo ayuda a equilibrar el alto costo de cubrir a individuos que están más enfermos y mayores, dijo Arturo Vargas Bustamante, profesor de la Escuela de Salud Pública Fielding de UCLA.
 Así que, cuando menos jóvenes se inscriben en la cobertura, las primas tienden a subir para todos. “Entonces, las personas enfermas que realmente necesitan cobertura pagan el precio”, dijo Vargas Bustamante.
 El programa DACA, vigente desde hace 13 años, no otorga estatus legal a sus beneficiarios, pero sí los protege de la deportación y les otorga autorización de trabajo. Se estima que más de 150,000 beneficiarios de DACA viven en California.
 La decisión del presidente Joe Biden de asegurar a los beneficiarios de DACA a través de los mercados de seguros se topó inmediatamente con la resistencia de los estados republicanos. El verano pasado, un grupo de 19 fiscales generales republicanos presentó una demanda en un tribunal federal para intentar detener la expansión del mercado de seguros a los beneficiarios de DACA. Un juez federal de Dakota del Norte falló a favor de los demandantes e impidió que la norma entrara en vigor en esos 19 estados. La nueva norma de los Centros de Servicios de Medicare y Medicaid se aplica a todos los estados.
 Los beneficiarios de DACA son el primer grupo de un gran número de inmigrantes que se espera que pierdan o abandonen pronto la cobertura del mercado de seguros. El presupuesto federal que el presidente Donald Trump aprobó el mes pasado elimina la asistencia financiera del mercado para algunos grupos de inmigrantes legalmente presentes, como refugiados y asilados, a partir de 2027. Sin asistencia financiera, muchos de estos beneficiarios probablemente no podrán costear su cobertura.
 Mientras tanto, todos los demás inscritos en un plan de Covered California podrían ver sus primas mensuales aumentar en $101 por mes a partir del próximo año.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/012825_Dreamers-LA_AJ_CM_04.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-11 15:57:25.835908

Roger Nutt, R-Moore, resigned his seat Monday in the Senate chamber, as seen in session Wednesday, March 23, 2022. (Travis Bell/STATEHOUSE CAROLINA/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — State Sen. Roger Nutt resigned his Upstate seat Monday after being diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease, the Moore Republican said in a news release.
Rep. Bobby Cox, a Greer Republican, has announced he will run for Nutt’s seat representing parts of Spartanburg and Greenville counties. To do so, Cox also resigned Monday from his House seat.
Nutt, a 59-year-old father of three, spent a decade on the Spartanburg County Council before winning a seat in the House in the 2020 election. He was elected to the Senate last November after emerging as the victor of a contentious, four-way GOP primary for an open seat.
  Rep. Roger Nutt, R-Moore. (Provided by Roger Nutt)
Nutt had been receiving medical treatment for what he believed were symptoms of long COVID, in which symptoms of the virus linger after the infection itself has ended. Doctors instead determined that Nutt had neurodegenerative disorder Alzheimer’s disease, according to a news release.
“While we are saddened by this news, we will face this trial with faith in the grace of God that has sustained our lives, our marriage and my career in public service for nearly 15 years,” Nutt said in a statement.
Following the resignation, the Senate set the dates of an election to fill Nutt’s seat, as per the timing rules in state law: Filing will open Aug. 29 for party primaries (if needed) Oct. 21. A general election will be Dec. 23.
Voters sent Nutt to the Senate to replace Sen. Scott Talley of Spartanburg, who opted not to seek a third term.
Nutt said Talley asked him to run, but others wanting the seat included former Sen. Lee Bright, a firebrand Republican who lost his reelection bid to Talley in 2016.
Bright placed first in the four-way primary last June, but Nutt ultimately defeated Bright in the runoff by fewer than 150 votes.
While in the House, Nutt voted with the Freedom Caucus much of the time, but he didn’t want to join the ultra-conservative group that split off from the main Republican Caucus out of fear of limiting his options, he said ahead of last year’s primary runoff.
During this year’s session in the Senate, Nutt sponsored a bill that would allow nursing home residents to select one person allowed to continue visiting in case of an emergency, such as another pandemic. Even in South Carolina, COVID-19 rules kept loved ones locked out from nursing homes for more than a year.
The bill passed the Senate but didn’t get a hearing in the House — at least, not this year. Legislators can still take it up after returning to the Statehouse in January.
“It is hard to describe how much I have enjoyed my time in the Senate,” Nutt wrote in his letter. “Serving in the Senate has been a dream come true, and I am so proud to be a small part of this great Body.”
Nutt encouraged Cox to run as his replacement, Cox wrote in a Facebook post Monday. The election for Cox’s seat will take place at the same time as the special election for Nutt’s seat.
It will also be the same day voters in Lexington County replace Rep. RJ May. Though written last Thursday, May’s resignation was received Monday from jail, where he’s being held without bond on charges of distributing child sexual abuse material.
Cox, first elected to the House in 2018, said he resigned the same day as Nutt to prevent the cost of multiple special elections.
“This decision will save taxpayer dollars, ensure the people of Greenville and Spartanburg Counties are not without representation for months in 2026, and allow me to fully dedicate myself to earning the trust of the voters for this next chapter of service,” Cox wrote.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_1276-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-11 15:57:25.835908

(Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife)A coalition of outdoor sporting groups intend to appeal the decision of a federal judge in Montana made last week that directed the federal government to reconsider whether gray wolves in the Rocky Mountains require additional protections under the Endangered Species Act.
The Sportsmen’s Alliance Foundation, Safari Club International and the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation on Wednesday submitted their notice to appeal the decision of U.S. District Court Judge Donald Molloy of Montana to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.
“This ruling is the latest string of nonstop litigation by environmental groups seeking to frustrate the original intent of the ESA, which is to recover endangered species and return them to state-based management, not keep them perpetually listed and under the authority of the federal government,” Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation President and CEO Kyle Weaver said in a press release. “Whether it’s the wolf or the grizzly bear, once an animal receives ESA protections, it becomes nearly impossible to remove them, even if populations meet recovery criteria over an extended period of time. The ESA needs an adjustment to renew its focus on real species recovery.”
In last Tuesday’s ruling, Molloy vacated a 2024 determination made by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service that gray wolves in the Western United States do not need increased federal protections.
Currently, gray wolves are listed as an endangered species in the contiguous 48 states, except in the Northern Rockies — Idaho, Montana, Wyoming and parts of Oregon and Washington — after management of the species in those regions was given over to the states following Congressional action in 2011.
 Conservationists argued in lawsuit that states are using inadequate scientific methods to assess wolf populations

A coalition of more than 70 environmental and conservation organizations submitted a petition to the federal government in 2021, asking the Fish and Wildlife Service to relist gray wolves in the Northern Rockies, or create a western Distinct Population Segment, or DPS, for the species with added protections.
The coalition argued in its petition, and subsequent lawsuit following the Fish and Wildlife Service’s determination against added protections, that due to concerns that states are using inadequate scientific methods to assess population statistics, harsh political rhetoric and increased mandates in Montana and Idaho to reduce wolf populations, and because wolves do not inhabit the full extent of their historic range — which once broadly comprised the entire western U.S — the species meets the criteria for reconsideration under the Endangered Species Act.
“Management of Canis lupus must not be by a political yo-yo process,” Molloy wrote, adding that the federal government had “failed to use the best available science” in its species analysis.
Molloy’s ruling requires the Fish and Wildlife Service to reevaluate whether gray wolves should receive increased federal protections.
 Montana state officials disagree with federal judge’s wolf ruling

While members of the conservation coalition praised last Tuesday’s decision, officials in Montana, which joined the lawsuit as an intervenor-defendant, and Idaho, which filed an amicus brief on behalf of the federal government, disagreed with the ruling by an “activist judge.”
“Montana has a healthy, sustainable population of wolves. While we are reviewing the decision, it will not implicate our state’s management efforts or our wolf season,” said Kaitlin Price, a spokesperson for Gov. Greg Gianforte’s office. “Unfortunately, we’re not surprised to see another activist decision in favor of environmental extremists.”
Price said that if the Fish and Wildlife Service appeals the decision, Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks “will be there to support them.”
Price could not be reached before publication about whether the state and Fish, Wildlife and Parks would sign on to the current notice of appeal.
“We’re extremely disappointed with the decision considering Idaho has managed a wolf population above federal recovery goals for decades and sustained more-than-adequate wolf populations since Congress removed them from Endangered Species Act protection in 2011,” Idaho Fish and Game Director Jim Fredericks told the Idaho Capital Sun in a written statement.
Molloy’s ruling does not currently change the status of gray wolves, which are managed by each state’s respective wildlife agency.
In Montana, where gray wolves number approximately 1,100, Fish, Wildlife and Parks has proposed new hunting and trapping regulations for the upcoming wolf season that would set a statewide quota of 500 animals — up from 334 in 2024 — and would significantly increase bag limits allowing hunters and trappers to kill up to 15 wolves on a single hunting or trapping license, for up to 30 total wolves.
Arguments from the coalition in support of its appeal are expected to be filed soon, according to Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation staff.
“We had to appeal this decision,” Michael Jean, litigation counsel for Sportsmen’s Alliance Foundation, said in a press statement. “This decision seems to hold that unless a species is not recovered across its entire historical range, then it has to stay listed — regardless of thriving populations. It’s difficult to see how the wolf, or other listed species, will ever be deemed recovered under that standard.”

National Guard, pledges similar crackdown in Democratic cities","Ariana Figueroa, Jacob Fischler",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-mobilizes-dc-national-guard-pledges-similar-crackdown-democratic-cities,,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump asserted control Monday of the District of Columbia police force and mobilized 800 National Guard troops in the nation’s capital under what he declared a ""crime emergency.""Trump took the step despite a three-decade low in violent crime in Washington, D.C., while warning he may pursue similar action in other Democratic-led cities that he sees as having “totally out of control” crime.Trump at a press conference said that he hopes other Democratic-led cities are watching because Monday’s actions in the district are just the beginning.“We’re starting very strongly with D.C.,” Trump said.The president placed the Metropolitan Police Department of roughly 3,400 officers under federal control, citing the district’s Home Rule Act that allows for the federal takeover until an emergency is declared over, or 30 days after the declaration. Congress can also authorize the extension.“We’re going to take our capital back,” Trump said.The mayor of the district, Muriel Bowser, called Monday’s action ""unsettling and unprecedented.” She added that she was not informed by the president that the district’s police force would be taken over.DOGE staffer hurtThe escalation of federal control came after a former U.S. Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, official was injured in an attempted carjacking incident around 3 a.m. Eastern near the district neighborhood of Logan Circle. Two Maryland teenagers were arrested on charges of unarmed carjacking in connection with the incident.The president said he is prepared to send in more National Guard “if needed,” and that he will handle the city the same way he has handled immigration at the southern border. The Trump administration has been carrying out a campaign of mass deportations.Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said during the press conference that members of the National Guard will be “flowing into” the district sometime this week.Local officials in the district protested Trump’s move. D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb, an elected official, wrote on X, formerly Twitter, that the Trump administration’s “actions are unprecedented, unnecessary, and unlawful.”“There is no crime emergency in the District of Columbia. Violent crime in DC reached historic 30-year lows last year, and is down another 26% so far this year,” Schwalb said.“We are considering all of our options and will do what is necessary to protect the rights and safety of District residents,” he continued.Trump at the press conference said that he’s also directed officials to clear out encampments of homeless people in the district, but did not detail where those people would be moved.Hundreds of federal law enforcement officers, representing agencies from the Drug Enforcement Agency to the Interior Department, were deployed across the city Saturday and Sunday.Los Angeles and beyondThe president’s crackdown in the district occurred after a federal appeals court this summer temporarily approved Trump’s move to take control of the California National Guard from Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom for the purpose of quelling protests over the administration's aggressive immigration raids.The president Monday slammed several major Democratic cities – Baltimore, Chicago, New York City and Oakland – and inaccurately claimed they had the highest murder rates. Trump said that he hopes other cities are “watching us today.”“Maybe they’ll self clean up and maybe they'll self do this and get rid of the cashless bail thing and all of the things that caused the problem,” the president said.Trump pointed at Chicago, criticizing Mayor Brandon Johnson and Illinois Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker.“I understand he wants to be president,” Trump said of Pritzker, before taking a shot at the governor's personal appearance. “I noticed he lost a little weight so maybe he has a chance.”Pritzker is hosting Texas Democrats who left the state to prevent the state legislature from having a quorum after Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott called a special session in order to redistrict the state to give more seats to Republicans in Congress.GOP applauds The top Republican on the U.S. House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, which has jurisdiction over the district, praised Trump’s decision to deploy the National Guard and take over the police department.“President Trump is rightly using executive power to take bold and necessary action to crack down on crime and restore law and order in Washington, D.C.,” Rep. James Comer, Republican of Kentucky, said in a statement.Comer added that the committee next month will hold a hearing with Schwalb, D.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson and Mayor Muriel Bowser.While state governors have control over their National Guards, the president has control over the National Guard members in the district. The National Guard does not have arresting authority, under the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878, which generally bars the use of the military for domestic law enforcement purposes.During Trump’s first term, he deployed roughly 5,000 National Guard on Black Lives Matter protesters in the district after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis in 2020.And despite requests from congressional leaders, Trump notably delayed activating National Guard members during the 2021 insurrection on the U.S. Capitol, when the president's supporters tried to subvert the certification of the 2020 presidential election.In one of Trump’s first actions on his inauguration day in January, he pardoned hundreds of Jan. 6 rioters who were charged by the Department of Justice for their involvement in the insurrection.Putin meetingIn a question-and-answer session after announcing the National Guard deployment, Trump told reporters he hoped his meeting this week with Russian President Vladimir Putin would help put that country on a path to peace with Ukraine, which he said would involve each country ceding some territory to the other.Trump described the Friday summit in Alaska — Putin’s first visit to the U.S. in a decade — as a “feel-out meeting.”Asked if Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was invited to the summit, Trump said he was “not part of it.” Any framework for peace discussed between Trump and Putin would be relayed to Zelenskyy, he said.An end to the war would have to come from direct talks between Putin and Zelenskyy, which may or may not ultimately involve the U.S., he said.“I’m going to put the two of them in a room, and I’ll be there or I won’t be there, and I think it’ll get solved,” he said of Putin and Zelenskyy.Trump said he was “a little disappointed” that Zelenskyy did not immediately agree to cede territory to Russia, which invaded his country in February 2022. Zelenskyy has repeatedly said giving land to Russia was a nonstarter, including after Trump suggested it over the weekend.“Ukrainians will not gift their land to the occupier,” Zelenskyy said in a video address Saturday, according to The New York Times.",,,,2025-08-11 15:57:25.835908

(Photo by Shalina Chatlani/ Stateline)At least 12 states have received federal approval to restrict recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, from using their benefits to purchase certain foods such as soda and candy.
The states receiving waivers from the U.S. Department of Agriculture are overwhelmingly Republican. Colorado, Florida, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Texas and West Virginia received approval last week. The feds granted waivers to Arkansas, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Nebraska and Utah earlier this year.
SNAP served on average nearly 42 million people a month in fiscal 2024, with about 12% of the U.S. population receiving benefits.
GOP cuts to food assistance would hit rural America especially hard

The trend is part of U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s agenda to “make America healthy again” by inviting states to apply for waivers to change SNAP rules to limit what types of food recipients can buy.
Kennedy said in a statement that SNAP has used taxpayer dollars to “fuel America’s diabetes and chronic disease epidemics.”
“These waivers help put real food back at the center of the program and empower states to lead the charge in protecting public health,” the statement said.
Critics of these waivers say the policy could harm people in places such as food deserts, where healthy options are limited, and take away recipients’ power to make their own food choices.
Craig Gundersen, a professor in the Department of Economics at Baylor University, told Stateline that these changes could harm the integrity of the program.
“One of the main reasons why SNAP is such a successful program is because it gives dignity and autonomy to recipients. It gives dignity to recipients by allowing them to shop in the same manner as their neighbors, friends and family, and it gives autonomy to recipients by saying to families: You are the best ones to make decisions for your families about what to purchase,” Gundersen said.
Gundersen said he worries the restrictions could stigmatize SNAP, which he called one of the best programs for fighting food insecurity.

(Photo courtesy of Washington Department of Fish & Wildlife)A coalition of outdoor sporting groups intend to appeal the decision by a federal judge in Montana that directed the federal government to reconsider whether gray wolves in the Rocky Mountains require additional protections under the Endangered Species Act.
The Sportsmen’s Alliance Foundation, Safari Club International and the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation on Wednesday submitted their notice to appeal the decision of U.S. District Court Judge Donald Molloy of Montana to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.
“This ruling is the latest string of nonstop litigation by environmental groups seeking to frustrate the original intent of the ESA, which is to recover endangered species and return them to state-based management, not keep them perpetually listed and under the authority of the federal government,” Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation President and CEO Kyle Weaver said in a press release. “Whether it’s the wolf or the grizzly bear, once an animal receives ESA protections, it becomes nearly impossible to remove them, even if populations meet recovery criteria over an extended period of time. The ESA needs an adjustment to renew its focus on real species recovery.”
In Tuesday’s ruling, Molloy vacated a 2024 determination made by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service that gray wolves in the western United States do not need increased federal protections.
Federal court overturns decision denying Endangered Species protections to wolves

Currently, gray wolves are listed as an endangered species in the contiguous 48 states, except in the Northern Rockies — Idaho, Montana, Wyoming and parts of Oregon and Washington — after management of the species in those regions was given over to the states following Congressional action in 2011.
A coalition of more than 70 environmental and conservation organizations submitted a petition to the federal government in 2021, asking FWS to relist gray wolves in the Northern Rockies, or create a western Distinct Population Segment, or DPS, for the species with added protections.
The coalition argued in its petition, and subsequent lawsuit following FWS’s determination against added protections, that due to concerns that states are using inadequate scientific methods to assess population statistics, harsh political rhetoric and increased mandates in Montana and Idaho to reduce wolf populations, and because wolves do not inhabit the full extent of their historic range — which once broadly comprised the entire western U.S — the species meets the criteria for reconsideration under the ESA.
“Management of Canis lupus must not be by a political yo-yo process,” Molloy wrote, adding that the federal government had “failed to use the best available science” in its species analysis.
Molloy’s ruling requires FWS to reevaluate whether gray wolves should receive increased federal protections.
While members of the conservation coalition praised Tuesday’s decision, officials in Montana, which joined the lawsuit as an intervenor-defendant, and Idaho, which filed an amicus brief on behalf of the federal government, disagreed with the ruling by an “activist judge.”
“Montana has a healthy, sustainable population of wolves. While we are reviewing the decision, it will not implicate our state’s management efforts or our wolf season,” said Kaitlin Price, a spokesperson for Gov. Greg Gianforte’s office. “Unfortunately, we’re not surprised to see another activist decision in favor of environmental extremists.”
Price said that if FWS appeals the decision, Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks “will be there to support them.”
Price could not be reached before publication about whether the state and FWP would sign on to the current notice of appeal.
“We’re extremely disappointed with the decision considering Idaho has managed a wolf population above federal recovery goals for decades and sustained more-than-adequate wolf populations since Congress removed them from Endangered Species Act protection in 2011,” Idaho Fish and Game Director Jim Fredericks told the Idaho Capital Sun in a written statement.
Molloy’s ruling does not currently change the status of gray wolves, which are managed by each state’s respective wildlife agency.
In Montana, where gray wolves number approximately 1,100, FWP has proposed new hunting and trapping regulations for the upcoming wolf season that would set a statewide quota of 500 animals — up from 334 in 2024 — and would significantly increase bag limits allowing hunters and trappers to kill up to 15 wolves on a single hunting or trapping license, for up to 30 total wolves.
Arguments from the coalition in support of its appeal are expected to be filed soon, according to Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation staff.
“We had to appeal this decision,” Michael Jean, litigation counsel for Sportsmen’s Alliance Foundation, said in a press statement. “This decision seems to hold that unless a species is not recovered across its entire historical range, then it has to stay listed — regardless of thriving populations. It’s difficult to see how the wolf, or other listed species, will ever be deemed recovered under that standard.”

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Liam Niemeyer)LOUISVILLE — Ford Motor Company will invest nearly $2 billion to convert a longtime auto manufacturing plant in Louisville to build electric vehicles from a new platform adaptable to multiple vehicle types, aiming to launch a mid-sized EV pickup truck by 2027. 
Ford President and CEO Jim Farley told an audience of plant workers, local and state elected officials and other representatives Monday inside the Louisville Assembly Plant that moving forward with the  “universal” EV platform was a risk, especially with global EV competition, but the company was investing in the future. 
“We needed a rapid approach and a really tough challenge to create an affordable vehicle that delights customers in every way that matters,” Farley said. “We need to do it and be sustainable and make money, and we need to do it with American workers.” 
Farley and other Ford executives said the EV truck would be priced starting at $30,000, would have an “amazing range” and be built through a newly designed assembly line to be created at the Louisville plant. The EV batteries for the new platform will be supplied from a Michigan battery plant. The new truck will have 20% fewer parts compared to internal combustion engine vehicles, allowing for significantly quicker assembly line production. The more efficient assembly line for electric vehicles, these executives said, would also mean less physical strain workers and less getting in and out of vehicles.  
Farley was joined on stage by Democratic Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, who lauded the “massive investment” in the state. A release from Beshear’s office states Ford’s plant conversion would be the third largest economic development project in Kentucky’s history.

“This cutting-edge platform will be the foundation for the next generation of vehicles. The best part is, these vehicles will be affordable,” Beshear said. “They’re going to help so many American families keep more money in their pockets for groceries, medicine, school supplies and yes, even that family vacation.” 
Leaders with United Auto Workers Local 862, representing workers at Ford’s Louisville Assembly Plant and Kentucky Truck Plant in Louisville said the newly designed assembly line for electric vehicles would cause some plant workers to lose their jobs in Louisville and have to take jobs at another Ford operation. The Louisville Assembly Plant currently builds two SUVs, the Ford Escape and Lincoln Corsair.
“It’s not nearly as drastic as they expected when they first came at us talking about an EV,” said Brandon Reisinger, the Louisville Assembly Plant building chair for the union. “I don’t foresee anybody hitting the street at all. I don’t know that our working number will be exactly the same it is now, but nobody’s gonna get laid off.” 
  Brandon Reisinger with United Auto Workers Local 862 said he believed the low cost of charging electric vehicles can be convincing to consumers. (Kentucky Lantern photo by Liam Niemeyer)
Reisinger told reporters some of the work done elsewhere to preassemble cars before they arrive at the plant will be done at the plant with the new EV, offsetting the downsizing. He estimates the plant’s workforce will be about a couple hundred fewer people when the plant conversation is complete, also accounting for people who retire. Ford executives said 2,200 jobs at the plant will be “secured” with the conversion; about 3,300 workers are employed at the plant as of 2024, according to Ford. 
Reisinger said he believes the conversion could begin at the end of the year with some workers temporarily unemployed during a few months of the conversion, but the union’s contract provides for supplemental unemployment benefits to workers worth about 80% of a paycheck. 
When asked about political headwinds against electric vehicles from elected officials in the federal and state governments Reisinger pointed to the lower cost of charging an EV compared to filling up a gas tank as a compelling reason for EVs. 
“I’m going to end up buying me one of these as well when we start building,” Reisinger said. “It’s going to be a very cost-effective vehicle to drive.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_1740-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-11 14:57:07.228887

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)A convicted killer incarcerated for more than half a century lost his bid for freedom Monday after the New Jersey Supreme Court rejected his argument that his continued incarceration is unconstitutional under the state’s shifting parole law.
Fred Krug, 78, challenged the state parole board’s 2023 denial of his request for release, citing state and federal constitutional protections — known as ex post facto rights — that prohibit authorities from prolonging punishment by applying new laws to old offenses.
But the state’s top court, in a 6-1 decision, ruled that while state legislators widened parole access in 1979, they restricted it again in 1997 — and the 1997 restrictions were similar to the 1948 parole law that was in place when Krug committed his offenses.
“The U.S. Supreme Court has explained that the ex post facto analysis is concerned ‘solely with whether a statute assigns more disadvantageous criminal or penal consequences to an act than did the law in place when the act occurred.’ That remains true when it comes to changes in parole laws,” Justice Rachel Wainer Apter wrote for the majority. “There is simply no ex post facto problem in retroactively applying to a person the same parole regime that existed at the time he committed his offense.”
The state Office of the Public Defender represented Krug. Joseph J. Russo, an assistant public defender who heads the office’s parole revocation and resentencing unit, called Monday’s decision disappointing.
“For nearly two decades, Mr. Krug’s parole eligibility was governed by the 1979 Parole Act. The majority’s ruling disregards well-established constitutional protections and allows the Parole Board to change the rules long after individuals have relied on them to guide their conduct and plan for release,” Russo said in a statement.
Krug was convicted in 1974 and sentenced to life imprisonment for killing a schoolteacher in East Brunswick, assaulting another woman, and punching a police officer in 1973, all while he was on parole for previous convictions of rape, aggravated assault, and larceny, among other offenses, according to the ruling.
He applied five times for parole between 1994 and 2022, with the board denying him every time, the decision notes. In 2023, the board cited multiple reasons for their denial, including finding a likelihood that he would commit a new crime if paroled.
After his fifth rejection, he appealed, pinning his plea to legislative changes made in 1979 that created a presumption of release for parole applicants.
Before 1979, people angling to get out of New Jersey’s prisons were bound by the Parole Act of 1948. That act allowed the board to review “all existing available records” in determining whether to grant or deny parole.
In 1979, lawmakers repealed the 1948 law and replaced it with a law that largely barred the board from denying parole unless it had “new information” that justified continued confinement. Lawmakers tweaked that law again in 1997, removing the new information requirement and allowing the board to again consider an applicant’s entire record.
Krug had argued that the 1997 amendments subjected him to harsher penalties than he faced under the 1979 law, making his denial unconstitutional under ex post facto protections. He criticized the board’s “shifting position” relating to the many legislative changes, saying it “essentially asserts that it gets to pick and choose which Parole Act applies to a (pre-1997) inmate based on whichever Act makes it easiest to deny parole.”
Justice Michael Noriega, the lone dissenter, objected to the parole board resurrecting the repealed 1948 law to justify Krug’s continued incarceration, saying the board “creates a legal fiction that the 1979 Act never existed.”
The 1979 law was enacted with retroactive effect and set the expectations under which Krug served his sentence and sought parole, Noriega wrote.
“Then, in 1997, the State enacted new parole provisions that imposed more restrictive conditions that created a substantial risk of prolonged incarceration. In 2022, the Parole Board applied those stricter standards and denied Krug parole. The Ex Post Facto Clause was specifically designed to forbid and prevent such maneuvering,” Noriega wrote.
The court’s majority disagreed.
“Because the law at the time of Krug’s offenses permitted the Board to consider the same ‘all existing’ information it may now consider, we hold that retroactive application of the 1997 amendment to Krug created no risk of additional punishment,” Wainer Apter wrote.
Wainer Apter noted, though, that the majority decision does not address “whether the facts of this case, or any case involving a change in law that conferred a benefit on an inmate for many years, and then subsequently repealed that benefit, could implicate due process or fundamental fairness concerns.”
Monday’s ruling comes after multiple reports in recent years have dinged the parole board for its low release rates. The board has for years freed less than half of parole-eligible applicants, prompting calls for reform.

The private equity firm Thor Equities is leading the development efforts. Advocates say the firm plans to invest roughly a billion dollars in the project, which they say could eventually net the township and local schools multi-million dollar tax revenues.
The group of petitioning residents,  “Protect Augusta Township”,  started their campaign after the township board in July unanimously approved rezoning 522 acres of land from “agricultural residential” to “general industrial” use at Thor’s request.
At recent township board and planning commission meetings, dozens of local residents have voiced concerns that the data center could be a noisy, energy-intensive eyesore that permanently alters the landscape and local culture. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Data centers house vast arrays of computer equipment used to store digital information. They power internet services and use massive amounts of water and electricity. A Thor spokesperson told MLive the facility in Augusta township would use more than a million gallons of water per day.
“There hasn’t been major business in this community. It’s been farmland,” resident and signature-gatherer Travis Matts said. “To know that on the horizon, major development is creeping its way towards us is just kind of nerve-wracking.”
In some communities with data centers, locals have complained about the noise. Eileen Cosner is an Augusta Township resident. She’s concerned that people, pets and livestock will have to put up with the constant hum of data center cooling fans, periodic generator use, and noise during the data center’s construction.
According to MLive, Thor wants to purchase a total of 810 acres currently zoned as industrial and build the data center on about 20% of that land, leaving other areas undeveloped to act as a visual and sonic buffer between the data center and its residential neighbors.
 Cosner doesn’t trust Thor to only build on a small portion of the land it acquires.
“[I’m] pretty sure that once they buy it, they will build all the way down.”

Phil Santer is the chief of staff at Ann Arbor SPARK, a public-private nonprofit economic development organization that supports the data center development. Santer says once the data center is built it would be relatively unobtrusive. He says Thor has committed to abiding by the township’s noise ordinance, and that its planned billion dollar investment will provide roughly six million dollars in new annual tax revenue for the local school district, with additional revenue for township government.
“When I view an opportunity like a data center, what I see is highly impactful, in terms of value creation, but low impact in terms of what it actually means for the community,” Santer said. “These are going to generate a significant amount of taxes that will benefit the entire region.”
Augusta Township Trustee Keith Gipfert says he had concerns about the data center’s intensive energy demands until he met with DTE Energy and the Ypsilanti Community Utilities Authority, the local water utility. He said both assured him there is adequate supply. He says the potential tax revenue from the data center would be useful for maintaining aging bridges the township would otherwise struggle to pay for.
Matts feels township trustees pushed the zoning changes through too quickly. As he’s been gathering petition signatures, he says many residents are unaware of the project.
“Having gone door to door now for the past week canvassing, a lot of the folks in our community are completely unaware that the data center is being proposed at all,” Matts said.
The proposal is still in the early stages. The formal site review process has not yet begun and it is uncertain what company or companies may contract with Thor once the facility begins operations.
The referendum petition campaign, if successful, would give residents a chance to vote on Thor’s rezoning request themselves.
Why a data center and why in August Township?
As tech companies and governments around the world race to develop leading artificial intelligence tools, global demand for electricity to power data centers is projected to increase vastly.
Alongside private equity firms like Thor, tech companies including Amazon, Microsoft, Google and Meta, are collectively investing hundreds of billions of dollars in data center development. The U.S. Department of Energy has announced plans to establish public-private partnerships to begin operating data centers on department-owned land by 2027.
The International Energy Agency in an April report projected that electricity demand for data centers worldwide is expected to more than double by 2030. The report says “AI will be the most significant driver of this increase,” with electricity demand from AI-optimized data centers projected to more than quadruple by 2030. Goldman Sachs in February forecast a 165% increase in global electricity demand for data centers by 2030.
Santer says that in Michigan, larger data center developments became more economically feasible after Gov. Gretchen Whitmer signed significant tax exemptions for data centers into law last year. He says the Augusta Township site meets the three main requirements for successful data center development: power supply, water supply, and land in proximity to power transmission lines.
“So now, as a confluence of all those different factors, we’ve got opportunities to try and land some of these things in our community,” Santer said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2115899404-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-11 14:57:07.228887

(Photo by Amanda Hernández/Stateline)For years, state lawmakers have taken the lead on regulating kratom — the controversial herbal supplement used for pain relief, anxiety and opioid withdrawal symptoms. Some states have banned it entirely. Others have passed laws requiring age limits, labeling and lab testing.
At least half of the states and the District of Columbia have enacted some form of regulation on kratom or its components — building a patchwork of policies around a product largely unaddressed by the federal government.
But that may soon change. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is pushing to ban 7-hydroxymitragynine, or 7-OH — a powerful compound found in small amounts in kratom and sometimes concentrated or synthesized in products sold online, at smoke shops or behind gas station counters.
Federal health officials announced last month that the compound poses serious public health risks and should be classified as a Schedule I controlled substance, alongside heroin and LSD.
The move marks a significant shift in how federal regulators are approaching kratom, which they attempted to ban in 2016. It also has sparked debate about how the change could impact the growing 7-OH industry and its consumers.
This year, at least seven states have considered bills to tighten kratom regulations, including proposals for bans, age restrictions and labeling requirements.
Kratom, which originates from the leaves of a tree native to Southeast Asia, can have a wide range of mental and bodily effects, according to federal officials, addiction medicine specialists and kratom researchers. Reports of fatal kratom overdoses have surfaced in recent years, though kratom is often taken in combination with other substances.
Kratom and 7-OH are distinct products with separate markets, but they are closely connected. 7-OH is a semi-synthetic compound derived from kratom and only emerged on the market in late 2023, while kratom itself has been available for decades.










This is a public health crisis waiting to happen.


– Christopher R. McCurdy, professor of medicinal chemistry at the University of Florida


Leading kratom researchers also say more research is needed to fully understand the long-term effects of using both substances.
“There’s much we don’t know, unfortunately, on all sides,” said Christopher R. McCurdy, a professor of medicinal chemistry at the University of Florida. McCurdy is a trained pharmacist and has studied kratom for more than 20 years.
Research suggests kratom may help with opioid withdrawal and doesn’t seem to cause severe withdrawal on its own. Smaller amounts seem to act as a stimulant, while larger doses may have sedative, opioidlike effects. Very little is known about the risks of long-term use in humans, according to McCurdy.
As for 7-OH, it shows potential for treating pain, but it hasn’t been studied in humans, and it may carry a high risk of addiction. Researchers don’t yet understand how much is safe to take or how often it should be used, McCurdy told Stateline.
While some leading kratom experts agree that kratom and 7-OH should be regulated, they caution that placing 7-OH under a strict Schedule I classification would make it much harder to study — and argue it should instead be classified as Schedule II like some other opioids.
A federal survey from 2023 estimated that about 1.6 million Americans age 12 and older used kratom in the year before the study. The American Kratom Association, a national industry lobbying group, estimated in 2021 that between 11 million and 16 million Americans safely consume kratom products each year.
Since gaining popularity in recent years, 7-OH has appeared in a growing number of products. Some researchers and addiction medicine specialists say many consumers, especially those new to kratom, sometimes don’t understand the difference between products.
“It’s a pure opioid that’s available without a prescription, so it’s akin to having morphine or oxycodone for sale at a smoke shop or a gas station,” McCurdy said. “This is a public health crisis waiting to happen.”
Federal crackdown targets 7-OH, not kratom
In late July, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommended that the federal Drug Enforcement Administration place 7-OH in Schedule I, citing a high potential for abuse. The classification would not apply to kratom leaves or powders with naturally occurring 7-OH.
“We’re not targeting the kratom leaf or ground-up kratom,” FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said at a news conference. “We are targeting a concentrated synthetic byproduct that is an opioid.”
Makary acknowledged that there isn’t enough research or data to fully understand how widespread 7-OH’s use or impact may be. Still, he said the Trump administration wants to be “aggressive and proactive” in addressing the issue before it grows into a larger public health problem.
While only small amounts of 7-OH occur naturally in the kratom plant, federal officials have raised concerns about U.S. products containing synthetic or concentrated forms of the compound because it’s more potent than morphine and primarily responsible for kratom’s opioidlike effects.
The FDA’s recommendation to schedule 7-OH will now go to the DEA, which oversees the final steps of the process — including issuing a formal proposal and opening a public comment period.
If finalized, the rule could affect both companies selling enhanced kratom products and consumers in states where those products are currently legal.
The DEA backed off scheduling kratom compounds in 2016 after widespread public opposition.
Kirsten Smith, an assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Johns Hopkins University who is studying kratom’s effects in humans, said she was surprised by the FDA’s push to schedule 7-OH.
“We don’t really have a public health signal of a lot of adverse events for either kratom or for 7-OH at this time,” she told Stateline. “I was, frankly, always surprised that kratom was pushed toward scheduling at an earlier time point. … I don’t know that we have data to support scheduling even now.”
Still, some advocacy groups, including the Holistic Alternative Recovery Trust, argue the push to schedule 7-OH is driven more by corporate interests than public health, suggesting the kratom industry is trying to sideline competition from 7-OH products.
“We think that this is just happening because of the legacy kratom manufacturers losing market share and wanting to gin up a crisis with this,” said Jeff Smith, the national policy director for the group, who said he has used 7-OH for sleep and pain management.
While his organization supports regulation and safe consumption, members worry the federal government’s move could drive people to riskier substances or push the market underground.
“It’s made a profound difference in my life,” Smith said. “We think it would be tragic to cut it off based on such a paucity of data when there’s so much potential for this product to help people.”
Public health concerns
Federal health officials say a key concern is the growing use of kratom and 7-OH products among teens and young adults.
Some officials and addiction medicine specialists have pointed out that these products often come in flavors and packaging designed to appeal to younger buyers, with few controls over where or how they’re sold. In some states without clear regulations, kratom and 7-OH products are available at gas stations or online, sometimes without any age verification.

“Whenever you go into a gas station and even though it’s behind the glass, it’s kind of eye level, and it has all of these bright colors — it has all of these things that really attract the visual of a kiddo,” said Socorro Green, a prevention specialist with Youth180, a nonprofit focused on youth substance use prevention in Dallas.
Green added that kratom and 7-OH products may be even more accessible to young people in rural communities, where gas stations and convenience stores are often among the few available retailers.
Some researchers and experts say that certain products may not clearly or accurately disclose their 7-OH content and are sometimes marketed or mistaken for traditional kratom.
Some cities, counties and states have responded by banning kratom or raising the minimum purchase age to 18 or 21. But in many areas, enforcement remains inconsistent, and some addiction specialists say clearer federal and state guidance is needed — especially as more people are using kratom and 7-OH to manage pain, anxiety or withdrawal symptoms on their own.
“There needs to be some kind of oversight, including some way of maybe helping to ensure that people know what they’re getting,” said Terrence Walton, the executive director and chief executive officer of NAADAC, the Association for Addiction Professionals.
State regulations
At least seven states have considered or enacted legislation this year related to kratom — ranging from age restrictions and labeling requirements to outright bans.
In New York, lawmakers passed two bills: one requiring warning labels and prohibiting kratom products from being labeled as “all natural,” and another raising the minimum purchase age to 21. Neither has been sent to the governor.
In Colorado, a new measure, which was signed into law in May, prohibits kratom from being sold in forms that resemble candy or appeal to children, increases labeling requirements, limits concentrations of 7-OH, and bans the manufacture and distribution of synthetic or semi-synthetic kratom.
In Mississippi, a new law that took effect in July raised the minimum purchase age for kratom to 21. It also bans synthetic kratom extracts and products with high concentrations of 7-OH. Lawmakers in Montana and Texas introduced similar legislation this year, but neither proposal advanced.
Louisiana is the latest state to enact a kratom ban, which took effect Aug. 1. Meanwhile, in July, Rhode Island became the first state to reverse its ban. The new law establishes a regulatory framework for the manufacturing, sale and distribution of kratom products, set to take effect in April 2026.
As of this year, Washington, D.C., and seven states — Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Louisiana, Rhode Island (until April 2026), Vermont and Wisconsin — have banned kratom. At least half of U.S. states now regulate kratom or its components in some way.

For years, state lawmakers have taken the lead on regulating kratom — the controversial herbal supplement used for pain relief, anxiety and opioid withdrawal symptoms. Some states have banned it entirely. Others have passed laws requiring age limits, labeling and lab testing.
At least half of the states and the District of Columbia have enacted some form of regulation on kratom or its components — building a patchwork of policies around a product largely unaddressed by the federal government.
But that may soon change. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is pushing to ban 7-hydroxymitragynine, or 7-OH — a powerful compound found in small amounts in kratom and sometimes concentrated or synthesized in products sold online, at smoke shops or behind gas station counters.
Federal health officials announced last month that the compound poses serious public health risks and should be classified as a Schedule I controlled substance, alongside heroin and LSD.
The move marks a significant shift in how federal regulators are approaching kratom, which they attempted to ban in 2016. It also has sparked debate about how the change could impact the growing 7-OH industry and its consumers.
This year, at least seven states have considered bills to tighten kratom regulations, including proposals for bans, age restrictions and labeling requirements.
Kratom, which originates from the leaves of a tree native to Southeast Asia, can have a wide range of mental and bodily effects, according to federal officials, addiction medicine specialists and kratom researchers. Reports of fatal kratom overdoses have surfaced in recent years, though kratom is often taken in combination with other substances.
Kratom and 7-OH are distinct products with separate markets, but they are closely connected. 7-OH is a semi-synthetic compound derived from kratom and only emerged on the market in late 2023, while kratom itself has been available for decades.
Leading kratom researchers also say more research is needed to fully understand the long-term effects of using both substances.
“There’s much we don’t know, unfortunately, on all sides,” said Christopher R. McCurdy, a professor of medicinal chemistry at the University of Florida. McCurdy is a trained pharmacist and has studied kratom for more than 20 years.
Research suggests kratom may help with opioid withdrawal and doesn’t seem to cause severe withdrawal on its own. Smaller amounts seem to act as a stimulant, while larger doses may have sedative, opioidlike effects. Very little is known about the risks of long-term use in humans, according to McCurdy.
As for 7-OH, it shows potential for treating pain, but it hasn’t been studied in humans, and it may carry a high risk of addiction. Researchers don’t yet understand how much is safe to take or how often it should be used, McCurdy told Stateline.
While some leading kratom experts agree that kratom and 7-OH should be regulated, they caution that placing 7-OH under a strict Schedule I classification would make it much harder to study — and argue it should instead be classified as Schedule II like some other opioids.
A federal survey from 2023 estimated that about 1.6 million Americans age 12 and older used kratom in the year before the study. The American Kratom Association, a national industry lobbying group, estimated in 2021 that between 11 million and 16 million Americans safely consume kratom products each year.
Since gaining popularity in recent years, 7-OH has appeared in a growing number of products. Some researchers and addiction medicine specialists say many consumers, especially those new to kratom, sometimes don’t understand the difference between products.
“It’s a pure opioid that’s available without a prescription, so it’s akin to having morphine or oxycodone for sale at a smoke shop or a gas station,” McCurdy said. “This is a public health crisis waiting to happen.”
 Federal crackdown targets 7-OH, not kratom

In late July, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommended that the federal Drug Enforcement Administration place 7-OH in Schedule I, citing a high potential for abuse. The classification would not apply to kratom leaves or powders with naturally occurring 7-OH.
“We’re not targeting the kratom leaf or ground-up kratom,” FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said at a news conference. “We are targeting a concentrated synthetic byproduct that is an opioid.”
Makary acknowledged that there isn’t enough research or data to fully understand how widespread 7-OH’s use or impact may be. Still, he said the Trump administration wants to be “aggressive and proactive” in addressing the issue before it grows into a larger public health problem.
While only small amounts of 7-OH occur naturally in the kratom plant, federal officials have raised concerns about U.S. products containing synthetic or concentrated forms of the compound because it’s more potent than morphine and primarily responsible for kratom’s opioidlike effects.
The FDA’s recommendation to schedule 7-OH will now go to the DEA, which oversees the final steps of the process — including issuing a formal proposal and opening a public comment period.
If finalized, the rule could affect both companies selling enhanced kratom products and consumers in states where those products are currently legal.
The DEA backed off scheduling kratom compounds in 2016 after widespread public opposition.
Kirsten Smith, an assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Johns Hopkins University who is studying kratom’s effects in humans, said she was surprised by the FDA’s push to schedule 7-OH.
“We don’t really have a public health signal of a lot of adverse events for either kratom or for 7-OH at this time,” she told Stateline. “I was, frankly, always surprised that kratom was pushed toward scheduling at an earlier time point. … I don’t know that we have data to support scheduling even now.”
Still, some advocacy groups, including the Holistic Alternative Recovery Trust, argue the push to schedule 7-OH is driven more by corporate interests than public health, suggesting the kratom industry is trying to sideline competition from 7-OH products.
“We think that this is just happening because of the legacy kratom manufacturers losing market share and wanting to gin up a crisis with this,” said Jeff Smith, the national policy director for the group, who said he has used 7-OH for sleep and pain management.
While his organization supports regulation and safe consumption, members worry the federal government’s move could drive people to riskier substances or push the market underground.
“It’s made a profound difference in my life,” Smith said. “We think it would be tragic to cut it off based on such a paucity of data when there’s so much potential for this product to help people.”
 
Public health concerns
 


Federal health officials say a key concern is the growing use of kratom and 7-OH products among teens and young adults.
Some officials and addiction medicine specialists have pointed out that these products often come in flavors and packaging designed to appeal to younger buyers, with few controls over where or how they’re sold. In some states without clear regulations, kratom and 7-OH products are available at gas stations or online, sometimes without any age verification.
“Whenever you go into a gas station and even though it’s behind the glass, it’s kind of eye level, and it has all of these bright colors — it has all of these things that really attract the visual of a kiddo,” said Socorro Green, a prevention specialist with Youth180, a nonprofit focused on youth substance use prevention in Dallas.
Green added that kratom and 7-OH products may be even more accessible to young people in rural communities, where gas stations and convenience stores are often among the few available retailers.
Some researchers and experts say that certain products may not clearly or accurately disclose their 7-OH content and are sometimes marketed or mistaken for traditional kratom.
Some cities, counties and states have responded by banning kratom or raising the minimum purchase age to 18 or 21. But in many areas, enforcement remains inconsistent, and some addiction specialists say clearer federal and state guidance is needed — especially as more people are using kratom and 7-OH to manage pain, anxiety or withdrawal symptoms on their own.
“There needs to be some kind of oversight, including some way of maybe helping to ensure that people know what they’re getting,” said Terrence Walton, the executive director and chief executive officer of NAADAC, the Association for Addiction Professionals.
 State regulations

At least seven states have considered or enacted legislation this year related to kratom — ranging from age restrictions and labeling requirements to outright bans.
In New York, lawmakers passed two bills: one requiring warning labels and prohibiting kratom products from being labeled as “all natural,” and another raising the minimum purchase age to 21. Neither has been sent to the governor.
In Colorado, a new measure, which was signed into law in May, prohibits kratom from being sold in forms that resemble candy or appeal to children, increases labeling requirements, limits concentrations of 7-OH, and bans the manufacture and distribution of synthetic or semi-synthetic kratom.
In Mississippi, a new law that took effect in July raised the minimum purchase age for kratom to 21. It also bans synthetic kratom extracts and products with high concentrations of 7-OH. Lawmakers in Montana and Texas introduced similar legislation this year, but neither proposal advanced.

Fueled by hot summer weather and persistent drought conditions across the western half of the state, wildfires as of Aug. 8 had burned more than 100,000 acres in Colorado in 2025.
By that time it was already Colorado’s worst fire year since 2020, when multiple historic blazes burned a record-setting 625,357 acres, according to National Interagency Fire Center data.
Drought conditions classified as “severe” or “extreme” extend across the majority of the Western Slope, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. A critical fire weather advisory for western Colorado and several neighboring states has been issued by the Rocky Mountain Area Coordination Center, a Denver-based branch of the NIFC, and will remain in place through at least mid-August.

“After a dry winter with minimal snowpack fuel moistures are well below normal, and much of the region is under severe to extreme drought,” the agency warns. “Extreme fire behavior marked by rapid spread, torching, and resistance to control is being driven by critically dry … fuels, and drought-stressed brush and trees. As heat intensifies and fuel moistures decline further, fire potential will remain elevated across the area.”
Here is a look at three 2025 Colorado fires:

The Lee Fire, west of the town of Meeker in Rio Blanco County, has burned an estimated 106,672 acres with 6% containment as of Aug. 10. It’s believed to have been caused by lightning on Aug. 2.
The nearby Elk Fire, southeast of Meeker, is also believed to have been caused by lightning on Aug. 2. It has burned an estimated 14,635 as of Aug. 8, and is 9% contained.
The Turner Gulch Fire, east of Gateway near the Colorado-Utah border in Mesa County, is 49% contained and has burned an estimated 28,403 acres since it was started by lightning on July 10.

Gov. Jared Polis recently issued disaster declarations for fires in Delta, Mesa, Montrose and Rio Blanco counties. On Aug. 6, he mobilized the Colorado National Guard to support firefighting efforts on the Lee and Elk fires.
Due to climate change, much of Colorado has grown hotter and drier in recent decades, increasing wildfire risk. The three largest wildfires in Colorado history all occurred in 2020, and the state’s 20 biggest fires on record have all occurred in the past 20 years. Rising levels of greenhouse gases, mostly the result of fossil-fuel combustion, have caused much of the Western Slope to warm by an average of more than 4 degrees Fahrenheit above pre-industrial levels, and the region’s current “megadrought” is its worst dry spell in at least 1,200 years.
Most wildfires are caused by human activity. To minimize the risk of sparking a fire, authorities urge visitors to national forests and other public lands to follow local fire restrictions, ensure that vehicles are properly maintained and trailer chains are secured, and avoid driving or parking on dry grass.
In 2017, the State Forest Service reported that more than 2.9 million Coloradans lived in the “wildland-urban interface” — areas at risk of being impacted by wildfires. Fire safety experts urge residents of such zones to familiarize themselves with the “Ready, Set, Go” system of precautions.

Western Slope wildfires already add up to Colorado’s worst fire year since 2020


By: Chase Woodruff - Wednesday August 6, 2025 2:23 pm


















High winds and extreme drought conditions in northwest Colorado have fueled the rapid growth of two wildfires this week near Meeker in Rio Blanco County, where firefighting crews say they’re prioritizing structure protection with “limited resources” on hand.
The Lee Fire, west of Meeker, nearly doubled in size Tuesday and has now burned 22,497 acres, predominantly on Bureau of Land Management land south of Colorado Highway 13. About 20 miles to the east, the Elk Fire is estimated at 8,304 acres in size. Both fires are believed to have been started by lightning strikes on Aug. 2.
With the latest growth, the estimated area burned in Colorado by 11 major wildfires in 2025 now stands at 64,196 acres, according to federal data. That doesn’t include smaller fires suppressed by state and local first responders, but it already makes for the state’s worst fire year since 2020.

HOST: Paul Hattis & John McDonough
GUEST: Eric Dickson, president and CEO of UMass Memorial Health







THE BAY STATE is already struggling with a primary care provider crisis, and the head of the largest not-for-profit health care system in Central Massachusetts sees an increasingly grim road ahead if current trends persist. 
This week on the monthly Health or Consequences episode of The Codcast, John McDonough of the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health and Paul Hattis of the Lown Institute spoke with Eric Dickson, president and CEO of UMass Memorial Health. 
“It pains me, especially as an emergency physician, to look at the trajectory of some of the key metrics and health care in this state,” Dickson said.  
Massachusetts now has the third longest ER wait times in country, which Dickson said is a reflection of a decline in primary care access.  
“Primary care is the foundation of any good health care system, on a national or state level or regional basis,” he said. “So you don’t have primary care. Patients can’t get seen early. They end up in the emergency department later, in the course of their disease, which explains a lot about why healthcare costs so much in the state of Massachusetts.” 
Medical universities are struggling to produce enough physicians to keep up with the need, he said.  
UMass Chan is one of only two New England medical schools to rank in the top 10 percentile for primary care education, he noted. But students attending the school – where Dickson himself studied medicine – are now paying far more than he did, or doing the math and concluding that working in primary care and paying back loans to cover $70,000 a year in out-of-state tuition is unmanageable. 
And federal headwinds are not helping the broader health landscape, he said. For hospitals that have a large number of patients on Medicaid, like UMass Memorial, they will be greatly impacted” by the coming cuts to Medicaid signed into law on July 4 by President Trump in the sweeping tax and spend bill. 
But the scale of damage is still hard to pin down, Dickson said, because new work requirements for Medicaid recipients will go into effect in October 2026 and take some unknown number of people off of their coverage. Plus the new federal posture on vaccinations from Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has a long history of vaccine skepticism and is rolling back recommendations and research into vaccinations, will likely lead to resurgences in long-forgotten diseases, Dickson said. 
“This will become a nation of people with chronic disease,” he said. “And as the population, ages and medications get better to keep people alive longer, it’s a little bit scary to think about the shortage of primary care that exists today, and how bad that will be 10 years from now, if something doesn’t change.” 
On the episode, Dickson discusses the primary care crisis (03:10), the looming Medicaid cuts and National Institutes of Health funding cuts (07:20), and the consolidation of medical providers in Massachusetts (18:00).

Gov. Jared Polis declared a disaster emergency to support Oak Fire response efforts Sunday, and he authorized use of the National Guard as needed. The fire had burned 75 acres as of Monday morning.
The Elk Fire burning in northwestern Colorado, east of the Lee Fire, had reached 30% containment on Monday as crews gained more control over the flames. As of Monday, it had burned more than 14,600 acres. It was also believed to have been started by a lightning strike.
As the Lee Fire continued to move south throughout the weekend and on Monday, the Garfield County Sheriff’s Office warned residents near parts of Rifle to prepare for potential evacuation orders.
On Saturday, all 179 inmates in the Rifle Correctional Center were evacuated, according to the Colorado Department of Corrections. The evacuees were relocated to the state prison in Buena Vista, and no injuries were reported.
Crews have kept the Lee Fire from reaching past the west side of Colo. 13, according to a Monday morning briefing by Rocky Mountain Area Complex Incident Management 3.
A public meeting providing updates on the Lee Fire is scheduled for Monday at 7 p.m. at Colorado Mountain College, according to the Rio Blanco County Sheriff’s Office.

(Photo by Mary Ann Chastain/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — Rep. RJ May has resigned his House seat two months after his arrest on charges of distributing child sexual abuse material, according to a letter the House Speaker’s Office received Monday.
The West Columbia Republican, who remains in jail without bond, has been suspended from the House without pay since his June arrest, as is required by state law for any public official indicted on a felony. He was also the subject of a House Ethics Commission investigation, which would have been the first step toward expelling him from the House.
“I have decided that it is in the best interest of my family and constituents to resign immediately from the South Carolina House of Representatives,” May wrote in his letter, dated Thursday. “Please accept this letter as my formal resignation from the South Carolina House of Representatives.”

copier@scstatehouse.gov_20250811_113331 
“It has been an honor to serve the people of District 88,” the three-sentence letter concluded.
As required by law, the election for May’s seat is expected to take place Dec. 23, the month before the legislative session begins. Filing would open Aug. 29, with a primary election taking place Oct. 21, according to the State Election Commission.
The office of House Speaker Murrell Smith must still officially set the dates.
House Majority Leader Davey Hiott, R-Pickens, said he expected the ethics complaint he had filed against May to end, since May is no longer a member of the House.
Rep. Jordan Pace, a Goose Creek Republican and Freedom Caucus chairman, said he welcomed May’s resignation and had hoped the House would have already expelled him. May was a founding member of the ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus and acted as its de facto spokesman until the investigation into him became public.
“Our hearts are with his victims and his innocent family, and we pray for swift justice as this ugly chapter in the South Carolina House of Representatives comes to a close,” the Freedom Caucus said in a statement.

The investigation into May began in April 2024, when social messaging app Kik notified a federal nonprofit that videos involving child sexual abuse had been sent from an account called “joebidennnn69.”
Federal investigators tracked the account, which had saved 220 different videos and images depicting child sexual abuse, to May’s house and cellphone, prosecutors said during a June detention hearing.
An attorney for May argued that someone had hacked into his accounts and targeted the 38-year-old father of two for political reasons.
During the investigation, May continued showing up to session every day, though he stayed quiet instead of participating in debates. He continued to vote alongside the Freedom Caucus, though he hadn’t been a member since news broke that investigators had seized his computers in August.

(Courtesy of the Utah Agent Orange Veterans Foundation)Stories involving Agent Orange and similar toxic herbicides used during the Vietnam War tend to be somewhat somber in nature. And there is a very good reason for such sadness. Those chemicals have caused an enormous amount of harm to humans and the environment.
In this account however, I have chosen to focus on a more positive view of the deadly defoliant Agent Orange. That aspect is the approval of a location for a  prominent monument honoring veterans who have died as a result of their exposure to toxic chemicals used by the U.S. military during the war in Southeast Asia.
From the establishment of the Utah Agent Orange Veterans Foundation (UAOVF) in 2023, Vietnam veteran Larry Kerr, the organization’s founder and chairman, conceived of locating an Agent Orange memorial near the Vietnam Veterans Memorial replica in Layton Commons Park.
The park seemed to Larry and others at the UAOVF to be the most advantageous and appropriate site for an Agent Orange monument. This was due in part to its central location, amenities, and military sights. The city’s Veterans Day Parade route also goes through Layton Commons Park.
UAOVF efforts to obtain site approval for the Agent Orange Memorial included speaking with Layton’s mayor, officials at the Department of Parks and Recreation, and addressing city council members at a meeting in February 2025. Unexpected opposition to UAOVF plans however, was encountered from city officials.
That opposition eventually compelled UAOVF officials to consider other potential sites for the Agent Orange Memorial. At a meeting on Aug. 5, those efforts paid off. City officials from Sunset, a city about 8 miles north of Layton, gave the UAOVF permission to locate the memorial in Sunset City Veterans Memorial Park.
UAOVF officials are especially keen about this arrangement and the cordial reception they received from Sunset Mayor Scott Wiggill and other city officials. UAOVF Board of Directors member Hannah Turk echoed the sentiment of other UAOVF members in her enthusiastic comments about the meeting with Sunset City officials. 
In Hannah’s words, “the amazing leadership of Sunset City, and their city council welcomed us with open arms and full hearts. The support we received was overwhelming — in the very best way.” She went on to state that the meeting was “exactly the kind of reception our Vietnam Veterans have long deserved.”
That meeting like its topic, was nothing short of phenomenal. As Larry Kerr recently mentioned to me “the construction of Agent Orange memorials is a relatively new phenomenon that began in the eastern United States and has gradually been increasing in other places.” This expansion is due to the high number of veterans who have been dying from illnesses caused by their Agent Orange exposure.
Utah’s Agent Orange Memorial is one of the latest monuments in this ongoing trend and is destined to alter the state’s landscape as well as its storied history. This is because of the monument’s large size and its unique distinction of being the first of its kind in the Beehive State.
Groundbreaking for the memorial is expected to take place sometime in the near future and If things go as planned, Utah’s Agent Orange Memorial will be dedicated on Veterans Day 2025.

Greystar manages more than 950,000 rental units nationwide, including 34 properties in the Twin Cities and Rochester, according to the company’s website. 
ProPublica reported in 2022 that some of the biggest landlords in the country were using an algorithm developed by RealPage to set rents on open units. RealPage’s algorithm uses data collected from its clients — landlords who compete with each other for renters — to create price recommendations. 
Following ProPublica’s reporting, U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., and other senators asked the Department of Justice to investigate “allegations of anticompetitive collusion leading to significant increases in rents for apartments.” Klobuchar chairs the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Competition Policy, Antitrust, and Consumer Rights.
“This settlement is good news for renters across the country,” Klobuchar said in a press release, pointing out that the litigation continued even after President Donald Trump took office. 
In August 2024, the DOJ and several attorneys general, including Minnesota’s Keith Ellison, sued RealPage for “its unlawful scheme to decrease competition among landlords in apartment pricing and to monopolize the market for commercial revenue management software.”
Government lawyers amended the RealPage lawsuit in January to include six of the country’s largest landlords: Greystar, LivCor, Camden, Willow Bridge and Cortland. The amended complaint accused the landlords of not just using RealPage software, but also communicating directly with their competitors about rents, occupancy, pricing strategies and more. 
The proposed settlement, which was agreed to by the DOJ and Greystar, would bar Greystar from using any anticompetitive algorithm that recommends prices based on its competitors’ sensitive data, block the company from sharing sensitive information and require Greystar to cooperate with the ongoing investigation into RealPage. 
A federal judge will decide whether to approve the settlement after a 60-day public comment period.
Greystar admitted to no wrongdoing.
“Greystar remains committed to being at the forefront of innovation in service of its clients and residents, all within the bounds of the law,” the company said in a statement.

(Screengrab You Tube livestream)North Carolinians crowded into Harrah’s Cherokee Center in Asheville Sunday for a chance top hear from U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders.
The 83-year-old Vermont senator is using the August congressional recess for a series of stops across the nation billed as the “Fighting Oligarchy” tour.
Sanders told the audience that by standing together they can defeat authoritarianism and create a nation and a government that works for all.
“We’ve got a lot of work to do because today in America we are living in a nation in which in many respects we have become an oligarchic society, where our country is being run by a handful of multi-billionaires, and these people worship wealth and they worship power and they could care less about how they get what they want,” said Sander.
Sander said it is time to tell these oligarchs “enough is enough.”
Wealth inequality was a common theme during his 20-minute address.
“One guy — Mr.[Elon] Musk — owns more wealth than the bottom 52% of American households. It’s really hard to imagine that we have evolved into the kind of society with one man owning more wealth than the bottom half of America. You got the top 1% owning more wealth than the bottom 93%. You got the CEOs of large corporations making 350 times what their workers make,” Sanders said to an energized base.
Sanders said this disparity rarely receives the attention it deserves because of the concentration of ownership in the media.
“Why do you think the American people don’t discuss the important issues facing the working class of this country? It has everything to do with the fact that you have six major media conglomerates owning control what 90% of the American people see, hear and read,” Sanders said.
He called out Musk’s ownership of X, Larry Ellison’s purchase of Paramount (which owns CBS), Jeff Bezos’ ownership of the Washington Post, and Rupert Murdoch’s control of Fox News, the Wall Street Journal, the New York Post and more.
Sanders said ever since the Citizens United Supreme Court decision, billionaires have poured hundreds of millions of dollars into both political parties to buy more and more influence.
He told the crowd that if America hoped to retain democracy it would need to overturn Citizens United and embrace the public funding of elections.
“If you want to run for office, I want you to be able to do so, but you should not have to beg billionaires for campaign contributions and be beholden to them,” he said.
The progressive senator gave the audience plenty of reasons to consider a run for local office: a lack of affordable housing, an educational system from childcare to college that is much too expensive, and a health care system in which 85 million Americans are uninsured or underinsured.
At a Friday appearance in Wheeling, West Virginia, Sanders told the crowd one of the reasons he believed former Vice President Kamala Harris lost the 2024 race was because she had “too many billionaires telling her not to speak up for the working class of this country.”
Sander steered clear of that assertion in Asheville, instead noting Trump and his associates believe in a government of the billionaire class, by the billionaire class, and for the billionaire class.
“In this difficult moment in American history, we have got to respond in an unprecedented way. We need you. You can’t sit it out. Sorry, I know it’s tempting. You can’t put your head under your covers, we need you to join us in the struggle.”
Before Sunday’s Asheville rally, Sanders dismissed the likelihood that he would run for president in 2028. He turns 84 in September.
But the Vermont independent told CNN’s “State of the Union” there would be a younger candidate representing the party’s progressive wing.

He has appeared with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., by his side in more than half a dozen Fighting Oligarchy events. Former presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke has also shared the stage with Sanders.
Attracting younger voters to their cause may be key.
In the 2024 general election, just 57.4% of North Carolina’s eligible voters age 18-25 cast a ballot in the presidential election. For the 2024 primary, less than 8% of eligible voters in that age bracket voted.
Sanders knows they will need to improve turnout to see a reversal of fortunes.
“I don’t have a PhD in mathematics but I do know that 99% is a hell of a bigger number than 1%,” said Sanders in closing out his North Carolina appearance. “Brothers and sisters, let’s go forward. Let’s take on these oligarchs let’s beat them.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Bernie2.jpg,,,2025-08-11 13:56:59.587614

(Photo by Amanda Hernández/Stateline)For years, state lawmakers have taken the lead on regulating kratom — the controversial herbal supplement used for pain relief, anxiety and opioid withdrawal symptoms. Some states have banned it entirely. Others have passed laws requiring age limits, labeling and lab testing.
At least half of the states and the District of Columbia have enacted some form of regulation on kratom or its components — building a patchwork of policies around a product largely unaddressed by the federal government.
But that may soon change. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is pushing to ban 7-hydroxymitragynine, or 7-OH — a powerful compound found in small amounts in kratom and sometimes concentrated or synthesized in products sold online, at smoke shops or behind gas station counters.
Federal health officials announced last month that the compound poses serious public health risks and should be classified as a Schedule I controlled substance, alongside heroin and LSD.
The move marks a significant shift in how federal regulators are approaching kratom, which they attempted to ban in 2016. It also has sparked debate about how the change could impact the growing 7-OH industry and its consumers.
This year, at least seven states have considered bills to tighten kratom regulations, including proposals for bans, age restrictions and labeling requirements.
Kratom, which originates from the leaves of a tree native to Southeast Asia, can have a wide range of mental and bodily effects, according to federal officials, addiction medicine specialists and kratom researchers. Reports of fatal kratom overdoses have surfaced in recent years, though kratom is often taken in combination with other substances.
Kratom and 7-OH are distinct products with separate markets, but they are closely connected. 7-OH is a semi-synthetic compound derived from kratom and only emerged on the market in late 2023, while kratom itself has been available for decades.
Leading kratom researchers also say more research is needed to fully understand the long-term effects of using both substances.
“There’s much we don’t know, unfortunately, on all sides,” said Christopher R. McCurdy, a professor of medicinal chemistry at the University of Florida. McCurdy is a trained pharmacist and has studied kratom for more than 20 years.
Research suggests kratom may help with opioid withdrawal and doesn’t seem to cause severe withdrawal on its own. Smaller amounts seem to act as a stimulant, while larger doses may have sedative, opioidlike effects. Very little is known about the risks of long-term use in humans, according to McCurdy.
As for 7-OH, it shows potential for treating pain, but it hasn’t been studied in humans, and it may carry a high risk of addiction. Researchers don’t yet understand how much is safe to take or how often it should be used, McCurdy told Stateline.
While some leading kratom experts agree that kratom and 7-OH should be regulated, they caution that placing 7-OH under a strict Schedule I classification would make it much harder to study — and argue it should instead be classified as Schedule II like some other opioids.










This is a public health crisis waiting to happen. 


– Christopher R. McCurdy, professor of medicinal chemistry at the University of Florida


A federal survey from 2023 estimated that about 1.6 million Americans age 12 and older used kratom in the year before the study. The American Kratom Association, a national industry lobbying group, estimated in 2021 that between 11 million and 16 million Americans safely consume kratom products each year.
Since gaining popularity in recent years, 7-OH has appeared in a growing number of products. Some researchers and addiction medicine specialists say many consumers, especially those new to kratom, sometimes don’t understand the difference between products.
“It’s a pure opioid that’s available without a prescription, so it’s akin to having morphine or oxycodone for sale at a smoke shop or a gas station,” McCurdy said. “This is a public health crisis waiting to happen.”
 Federal crackdown targets 7-OH, not kratom

In late July, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommended that the federal Drug Enforcement Administration place 7-OH in Schedule I, citing a high potential for abuse. The classification would not apply to kratom leaves or powders with naturally occurring 7-OH.
“We’re not targeting the kratom leaf or ground-up kratom,” FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said at a news conference. “We are targeting a concentrated synthetic byproduct that is an opioid.”
Makary acknowledged that there isn’t enough research or data to fully understand how widespread 7-OH’s use or impact may be. Still, he said the Trump administration wants to be “aggressive and proactive” in addressing the issue before it grows into a larger public health problem.

While only small amounts of 7-OH occur naturally in the kratom plant, federal officials have raised concerns about U.S. products containing synthetic or concentrated forms of the compound because it’s more potent than morphine and primarily responsible for kratom’s opioidlike effects.
The FDA’s recommendation to schedule 7-OH will now go to the DEA, which oversees the final steps of the process — including issuing a formal proposal and opening a public comment period.
If finalized, the rule could affect both companies selling enhanced kratom products and consumers in states where those products are currently legal.
The DEA backed off scheduling kratom compounds in 2016 after widespread public opposition.
Kirsten Smith, an assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Johns Hopkins University who is studying kratom’s effects in humans, said she was surprised by the FDA’s push to schedule 7-OH.
“We don’t really have a public health signal of a lot of adverse events for either kratom or for 7-OH at this time,” she told Stateline. “I was, frankly, always surprised that kratom was pushed toward scheduling at an earlier time point. … I don’t know that we have data to support scheduling even now.”
Still, some advocacy groups, including the Holistic Alternative Recovery Trust, argue the push to schedule 7-OH is driven more by corporate interests than public health, suggesting the kratom industry is trying to sideline competition from 7-OH products.
“We think that this is just happening because of the legacy kratom manufacturers losing market share and wanting to gin up a crisis with this,” said Jeff Smith, the national policy director for the group, who said he has used 7-OH for sleep and pain management.
While his organization supports regulation and safe consumption, members worry the federal government’s move could drive people to riskier substances or push the market underground.
“It’s made a profound difference in my life,” Smith said. “We think it would be tragic to cut it off based on such a paucity of data when there’s so much potential for this product to help people.”
 Public health concerns

Federal health officials say a key concern is the growing use of kratom and 7-OH products among teens and young adults.
Some officials and addiction medicine specialists have pointed out that these products often come in flavors and packaging designed to appeal to younger buyers, with few controls over where or how they’re sold. In some states without clear regulations, kratom and 7-OH products are available at gas stations or online, sometimes without any age verification.

“Whenever you go into a gas station and even though it’s behind the glass, it’s kind of eye level, and it has all of these bright colors — it has all of these things that really attract the visual of a kiddo,” said Socorro Green, a prevention specialist with Youth180, a nonprofit focused on youth substance use prevention in Dallas.
Green added that kratom and 7-OH products may be even more accessible to young people in rural communities, where gas stations and convenience stores are often among the few available retailers.
Some researchers and experts say that certain products may not clearly or accurately disclose their 7-OH content and are sometimes marketed or mistaken for traditional kratom.

Some cities, counties and states have responded by banning kratom or raising the minimum purchase age to 18 or 21. But in many areas, enforcement remains inconsistent, and some addiction specialists say clearer federal and state guidance is needed — especially as more people are using kratom and 7-OH to manage pain, anxiety or withdrawal symptoms on their own.
“There needs to be some kind of oversight, including some way of maybe helping to ensure that people know what they’re getting,” said Terrence Walton, the executive director and chief executive officer of NAADAC, the Association for Addiction Professionals.
 State regulations

At least seven states have considered or enacted legislation this year related to kratom — ranging from age restrictions and labeling requirements to outright bans.
In New York, lawmakers passed two bills: one requiring warning labels and prohibiting kratom products from being labeled as “all natural,” and another raising the minimum purchase age to 21. Neither has been sent to the governor.
In Colorado, a new measure, which was signed into law in May, prohibits kratom from being sold in forms that resemble candy or appeal to children, increases labeling requirements, limits concentrations of 7-OH, and bans the manufacture and distribution of synthetic or semi-synthetic kratom.
In Mississippi, a new law that took effect in July raised the minimum purchase age for kratom to 21. It also bans synthetic kratom extracts and products with high concentrations of 7-OH. Lawmakers in Montana and Texas introduced similar legislation this year, but neither proposal advanced.
Louisiana is the latest state to enact a kratom ban, which took effect Aug. 1. Meanwhile, in July, Rhode Island became the first state to reverse its ban. The new law establishes a regulatory framework for the manufacturing, sale and distribution of kratom products, set to take effect in April 2026.
As of this year, Washington, D.C., and seven states — Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Louisiana, Rhode Island (until April 2026), Vermont and Wisconsin — have banned kratom. At least half of U.S. states now regulate kratom or its components in some way.

House Democrats say it was a necessary move to shore up funding as the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) warns of impending service cuts if they don’t receive more state support. But, Republicans in the chamber accused the other side of the aisle of political gamesmanship.
The bill increases funding for mass transit agencies in rural, urban and suburban areas by giving an additional 1.75% of the total sales tax collected to mass transit agencies. Democrats also emphasized that the bill included a number of Republican transportation priorities, including funding for roads and bridges and requirements that transit agencies explore public-private projects and combat fare evasion.

For months, lawmakers have been discussing how to increase transit funding as part of broader budget negotiations. But, six weeks after the constitutionally mandated June 30 deadline to pass it, SEPTA announced last week that it will have to cut service by 20% if lawmakers don’t act to boost their funding by Aug. 14.
“I believe there are those who want to play politics or leverage for other issues, but the simple reality is there is an issue in front of us, a transit crisis,” House majority leader Matt Bradford (D-Montgomery) said.
Republican Minority Leader Jesse Topper (R-Bedford), however, said the House’s move was nothing but a political show.
“While we believe [transit funding] is an integral part of the budget discussions that have been going on, it is part of the budget discussions,” Topper said. “We have to be able to get into a room and fix this budget in its entirety, not one issue at a time.”
Topper said that the Republican-controlled Senate is unlikely to act on transit funding as a standalone issue, instead viewing it as part of broader budget negotiations.
A spokesperson for Senate Majority Leader Joe Pittman (R-Indiana) did not respond to a request for comment. 
Roughly 1 million Pennsylvanians — about one in 13  people in the state — use mass transit every day in all 67 counties. About 800,000 of those use SEPTA. But transit authorities outside of the Philadelphia area have also warned they face service cuts if no additional funding is provided by the legislature.

(Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows officially responded to the U.S. Department of Justice’s request for sweeping voter data, questioning the federal agency’s intentions and asking that the request be withdrawn. 
The letter, sent Friday, comes after Bellows, a Democrat who is running for governor in 2026, told Maine Morning Star last month that she planned to tell the DOJ it does not have the right to such information.
In the letter addressed to Deputy Assistant Attorney General Michael Gates, Bellows wrote that she has “grave concerns about the seemingly overbroad scope of the Department of Justice’s information and records requests, which do not appear to be correlated with legitimate investigatory needs.” 
The DOJ did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The DOJ is asking for voter information from all 50 states, according to the National Association of Secretaries of State. Maine Morning Star’s partner outlets have been following these probes in at least nine other states so far. 
Trump administration requested voter data. Secretary Bellows says, ‘Go jump in the Gulf of Maine’

Bellows requested that the DOJ provide an explanation of why it made such requests in Maine, which included the statewide voter registration list, names of officials who handle the list’s maintenance and the number of ineligible voters the state identified due to noncitizenship, among other information about the state’s election processes.
“The United States Constitution entrusted the states, not the federal government, with responsibility for administering elections, and that’s a critically important check and balance on potential federal abuse of power,” Bellows shared in a statement on Monday. “The Department of Justice doesn’t get to know everything about you just because they want to, and I will do everything in my power to protect the privacy and security of Maine voters.”
Bellows received the detailed request from the the Civil Rights Division of the DOJ on July 24, following a less expansive inquiry from the Executive Office for United States Attorneys on July 10 for a phone call with Bellows to discuss a “potential information-sharing agreement” to provide the DOJ with information on registered voters in Maine.
In her response on Friday, Bellows also rejected the premise of some of the DOJ’s requests, including questioning the data provided for the election administration and voting survey conducted by the Election Assistance Commission, an independent agency of the U.S. government created by Congress in 2002 to aid the states in conducting safe and secure elections.
For example, the July 24 request noted that Maine’s survey response showed that there were nearly as many registered voters listed as active as the citizen voting age population in Maine in 2024, with a registration rate of 92.4%. The letter went on to request further details about the state’s response, such as information about the actions Maine is taking to ensure that ineligible voters are being removed and a list of all duplicate registrants the state has removed.
“Mainers should be extremely proud that our state is a national leader in voter registration and voter turnout,” Bellows said in a statement Monday. “Every eligible voter in Maine has the right to vote and should be encouraged to do so. Why the Department of Justice would question Maine’s success is beyond me and smacks of federal interference in our elections.”

Interestingly, in recent months, rather than proposing to make the minimum wage a living wage, some politicians – including President Trump – have championed the idea of ending taxes on the tips. Indeed, it’s a change that was included in the so-called big, beautiful bill Trump recently signed into law.
Unfortunately, while it’s an idea that may have superficial appeal in some circles, as researchers at the North Carolina Budget and Tax Center detailed in a recent brief, the proposal is more of a gimmick that would actually do little to help many low-income workers.

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)A legislative task force aiming to reduce property taxes for South Dakota homeowners will meet in Aberdeen this week with opportunities for public input.
The Comprehensive Property Tax Task Force will meet at 6:30 p.m. on Tuesday at the Kessler’s Champions Club on the Northern State University campus, and 9 a.m. on Wednesday in the same location.
The Tuesday evening meeting is dedicated solely to public comment, and the group is also scheduled to take public comment at 9 a.m. during the Wednesday meeting. Wednesday’s agenda also includes breakout discussions among task force members focusing on the intersection of property taxes with school, state government and local government funding.
From property to purchases: Task force considering fundamental tax shift to reduce homeowner burden

The task force is exploring government spending reductions as a potential way to cut property tax burdens. The group is also discussing an optional county-level sales tax of a half-percent to offset participating counties’ property taxes on owner-occupied homes, and a new state sales tax of 1% dedicated to education funding. The 1% tax would apply to most of the products and services that are currently exempted from sales taxes, and would stack on top of the existing state sales tax rate of 4.2% for other transactions.
Members of Abolish Property Taxes South Dakota pitched a transaction tax to the group at its Rapid City meeting last month. The proposal would aim to replace property taxes by adding a flat $1.50 tax on transactions of $15 or greater, and a tax of 10% on smaller transactions.
Earlier this year, lawmakers adopted Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden’s proposal to slow property tax increases with multifaceted reforms including a five-year, countywide 3% cap on growth in owner-occupied home assessments. That new law took effect July 1.

(Courtesy of Nebraska Department of Correctional Services)LINCOLN — Straight-line winds of 80-90 mph tore the roof off of parts of two housing units Saturday at the aging Nebraska State Penitentiary, displacing 387 inmates, the state announced.
Damage estimates and first steps toward temporary repairs were still taking place Monday, though more information was expected from the Department of Correctional Services.

Video of the damage shows parts of the roof being pulled off of a facility that has been the subject of much discussion in the Legislature for its need for upgrades or replacement.
Gov. Jim Pillen, in a tweet Sunday on X, credited Corrections Director Rob Jeffreys and his staff for safely relocating the inmates and said he was “incredibly proud” of their work.
Jeffreys, in a statement, said his team across the department trains “for the unexpected,” and “came together” to make sure “everyone was safe.” No injuries were reported.

About 250 of the 387 displaced inmates were moved from the two damaged housing units to a gym on site at the State Penitentiary. The remainder were sent to prisons in Tecumseh and Omaha.
Correctional Services set up a website for friends and family members to check if their loved ones were impacted, at https://corrections.nebraska.gov/rehabilitation/friends-and-family.
Repairs could take at least a month, according to a department press release from Sunday. Visits to inmates at the State Pen were canceled this weekend as the department assesses damage.

Saint Mark’s High School has appointed Aine Lafferty Bruhl as its new Director of Visual and Performing Arts, bringing with her more than a decade of experience in arts education, performance, and nonprofit leadership.
Bruhl steps into the role after serving as Program Director at the Philadelphia Arts in Education Partnership.
There, she managed arts programming in eight public schools and led professional development initiatives for teaching artists, along with community and family engagement efforts.
Her career also includes seven years at the Charter School of New Castle, where she founded the middle school drama program and served as Visual and Performing Arts Coordinator.
During her tenure, she directed school productions and secured grants to support arts integration.

Bruhl’s early work included teaching theater, music, and dance in schools and community programs across New York and Pennsylvania, including the Walnut Street Theatre and Riverdale YM-YWHA.
These roles laid the foundation for her enduring commitment to the arts and student-centered education.
At Saint Mark’s, Bruhl will lead the growth of the school’s visual and performing arts (VPA) program.
She aims to strengthen existing offerings while introducing new opportunities that make the arts more accessible and appealing to all students.
“Working for a well-established institution like Saint Mark’s excites me because of its rich history and the many individuals who have poured their time and energy into its success,” Bruhl said. “I’m eager to elevate the Visual and Performing Arts program, putting it on the map as a competitive and inclusive space where every student can find a way to be involved.”
Bruhl envisions a future where Saint Mark’s becomes a destination for aspiring young artists.
“I envision students applying to Saint Mark’s specifically to be part of its thriving theatre, dance, music, and visual arts programs, establishing the VPA department as a true draw and point of pride for the school,” she said.
Her plans include launching new student-led projects, building community partnerships, and connecting creative work to real-world careers.
Many of the careers students aspire to pursue rely on the very skills developed in arts classes, such as collaboration, problem-solving, innovation, and communication,” she said. “By highlighting how these skills translate beyond the arts, I hope to inspire more students to see the value of participating in VPA programming.”
Among her ideas are original student-written plays, improv-based clubs, and expanded involvement in local arts events in Delaware and Philadelphia.
While she kept upcoming production themes under wraps, Bruhl hinted that exciting details are on the way.
Dr. Eileen Wilkinson, principal of Saint Mark’s, expressed enthusiasm about Bruhl’s arrival.
“From her initial interview, I knew Mrs. Bruhl shared the mission of Saint Mark’s with a strong commitment to making the world more pleasing to God through the visual and performing arts,” she said. “Her passion and expertise will make more things possible for our students. I look forward to working with Mrs. Bruhl in the years to come.”

(Photo by Eric Lee/Getty Images)Violent crime in the United States fell 4.5% in 2024, according to a new FBI report, while property crime dropped 8.1% from the previous year.
The declines continue a trend seen since crime surged during the COVID-19 pandemic, when homicides jumped nearly 30% in 2020 — one of the largest one-year increases since the FBI began keeping records in 1930. By 2022, violent crime had fallen close to pre-pandemic levels.
Homicides, which the FBI classifies as murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, dropped nearly 15% in 2024. Reports of other violent offenses also decreased, including rape by 5.2%, robbery by 8.9% and aggravated assault by 3%.
Property crime also fell across all major categories, with motor vehicle theft down 18.6%, burglary down 8.6% and larceny-theft down 5.5%. Reported hate crimes decreased 1.5% from the previous year.
Violent crime continues to drop across US cities, report shows

The 2024 report draws on submissions from 16,675 law enforcement agencies — 2.1% more than last year — representing more than 95% of the U.S. population. Every city agency serving a population of 1 million or more people provided a full year of data. Participation in the FBI’s crime data collection is voluntary, and the data is based on crimes reported to police.
About 75% of participating agencies submitted information through the FBI’s new, more detailed National Incident-Based Reporting System, or NIBRS, which covered 87% of the population.
The data release marks a shift from recent years when participation lagged following the FBI’s 2021 transition to the new system, which required many law enforcement agencies to invest in training and technology upgrades. In 2021, national reporting rates fell below 70% for the first time in two decades, forcing the FBI to estimate results for many jurisdictions.
The FBI’s crime trends report also includes new law enforcement safety data. Sixty-four officers were feloniously killed in the line of duty in 2024, 43 officers were accidentally killed and 85,730 officers were assaulted.
Although the FBI’s 2024 report is a year behind, it aligns with other crime trend reports. The Council on Criminal Justice, a nonpartisan think tank, recently found that homicides and other serious offenses, including gun assaults and carjackings, fell in the first half of 2025 across 42 major cities compared to the same period in 2024.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Gov. Ron DeSantis did appoint a state trial judge on time, contrary to a complaint filed with the Florida Supreme Court last week by the American Civil Liberties Union.
The ACLU had urged the justices Friday to order DeSantis to fill the Eighth Judicial Circuit Court judgeship, which the state still listed as vacant at the time despite the constitutionally mandated window to fill it having elapsed.
Florida Supreme Court petition demands DeSantis fill vacant judgeship

Not so, lawyers for the state declared in a legal pleading filed later on Friday.
“Petitioner confidently asserts that the Governor ‘has refused to perform his duty to fill a vacancy on the Eighth Judicial Circuit Court’ by the constitutionally mandated deadline of August 3, 2025. … This is false,” DeSantis’ attorneys wrote, stating that the governor had appointed Alachua County Court Judge Kristine Van Vorst to the circuit court on Aug. 1.
Accompanying DeSantis’ response to the ACLU was his letter of that date informing Van Vorst of her appointment.
The ACLU, suing on behalf of Gary Edinger, a resident of the judicial circuit, pointed out that DeSantis’ office had not responded to its inquiries about the vacancy’s status before it filed suit against the governor, nor did it publish a news release announcing the appointment.
“Florida’s Constitution requires our government operate in the sunshine, not in secret,” they wrote in their notice of voluntary dismissal of the case, filed Monday.
As of this publication, the letter appointing Van Vorst had not been published on the governor’s appointments website, although the position was marked as filled.
A Phoenix check of the governor’s judicial appointment page last week, after the Aug. 1 appointment, showed that the spot was vacant.
“Despite making the at-issue appointment eight days ago, the Governor choose not to announce his action until after business hours a week later, only after Petitioner filed suit. Nor did the Governor’s counsel respond to undersigned counsel’s repeated pre-filing inquiries about whether the appointment was made,” the plaintiff’s attorneys wrote.
The circuit covers Alachua, Baker, Bradford, Gilchrist, Levy, and Union counties.
The difference between an appointment before or after Aug. 18 would’ve been the difference between the new judge’s first election happening in 2026 or 2028, the ACLU contended, potentially giving the appointee an “extra two unlawful years” to serve, the initial motion filed last week argued.
Primary elections are scheduled for Aug. 18, 2026. Per the Constitution, appointees don’t need to stand in an election happening less than a year from the date of appointment.

Article Summary

No Republican candidates have publicly announced they’re running for three statewide offices and just two have announced plans to run for governor as Gov. JB Pritzker seeks a third term.
Illinois GOP Chair Kathy Salvi says the One Big Beautiful Bill will be part of her party’s pitch to voters in 2026.
Both political parties will unofficially begin the 2026 campaign with rallies at the State Fair in Springfield this week.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story. 

SPRINGFIELD — With U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin, Comptroller Susana Mendoza and other members of Congress not seeking reelection in 2026, robust fields are growing in the Democratic primaries for the open seats.
Gov. JB Pritzker is seeking a rare third term and has been on the campaign trail for more than a month. Three high-profile Democrats are seeking to replace Durbin, sparking a flurry of state-level Democrats seeking to climb the political ladder.
But on the Republican side, it’s a ghost town in primary races for statewide offices so far.
﻿
“We’ve been decimated to the point in Illinois where we don’t have a strong bench,” former Republican State Rep. Mark Batinick, now a political consultant, told Capitol News Illinois.
At this week’s Illinois State Fair political days – long viewed as the unofficial start to election season in Illinois – the GOP’s focus will largely be on Washington in the absence of prominent state-level candidates, according to the state party chair.
“We have an opportunity in Illinois not only because Pritzker is such a trainwreck, but also because so many great things are happening with the leadership of this Republican president,” Illinois Republican Party Chair Kathy Salvi said in an interview.
But winning statewide elections has been a daunting task for Illinois Republicans since President Donald Trump first entered the national political stage in 2016. Two years later, in 2018, a “blue wave” swept the nation in Trump’s first midterm election and Pritzker was elected governor. Since that year, Democrats seeking statewide offices have cruised to victory.
Thus far, just two lesser-known Republicans have expressed interest in challenging Pritzker in 2026. A similar group of lesser-known candidates is considering a U.S. Senate run, but there has been no news about anyone running for comptroller, treasurer or secretary of state.
It’s still early in the election cycle — the petition gathering period began last week and runs through October — and Salvi said she expects there will be a Republican candidate in November for each statewide office.
GOP’s 2026 message
The Illinois GOP isn’t going to shy away from Trump, Salvi said, even though the party often tried to ignore his influence under her predecessor, Don Tracy, who is considering a run for statewide office.
Salvi said embracing the One Big Beautiful Bill will be a key part of her party’s message in 2026 that she believes will resonate with voters. She encouraged voters to find common ground on areas they agree with Trump and ignore things they disagree with.
“Look at the success of this White House,” Salvi said. “Go to the White House website every week, or more than that, and learn what’s happening. And if there’s something you don’t like, then fine. Just don’t talk about that. Look to what you do like. Find what we have in common.”
That’s a welcome strategy for the Illinois Freedom Caucus, a group of the General Assembly’s most conservative lawmakers that has criticized the party for not embracing Trump in recent years.
Collin Moseley, the caucus’ state director, said in an interview they want the party to support Trump-aligned candidates, but the Illinois party still has too many leaders who disassociate with Trump.
“I think that it’s mostly being stifled by people who hate Donald Trump in our own party, people who are clinging with a death grip to hold our party further to the left instead of moving to the right to the issues that working families care about,” Moseley said. “We are stuck in this old-fashioned way of campaigning and the old Republican Party that mostly has lost its way.”

Salvi is also hoping to capitalize on Trump’s performance in Illinois in 2024, in which he cut down 17-point losses in 2016 and 2020 to about 11 points, largely due to a falloff in Democratic votes. Meanwhile, Republicans did not lose seats in Springfield despite Democrats targeting several vulnerable districts.
Pritzker beatable? 
Pritzker is beatable, Batinick argued, citing the results of a poll released Thursday conducted by his polling firm and commissioned by the conservative Illinois Policy Institute where Batinick also works as a policy analyst. It found Pritzker’s favorability rating was at 47%.
The poll conducted last month of 752 likely 2026 Illinois voters found 60% of voters say “high taxes” is a top issue for them, while 26% named “state governance” as a top issue. Batinick said Pritzker appears set to run on his record of governing the state, but also frequently discusses national issues.
“The issues that matter to Illinoisans aren’t the issues that JB Pritzker is talking about right now,” he said.
The primary race to challenge Pritzker is still taking shape with DuPage County Sheriff Jim Mendrick the most notable name seeking the office so far. Lake Forest businessman Joseph Severino, who has run for Congress as a Republican and independent, has announced his intention to run for governor, but has not filed a fundraising committee with the State Board of Elections.
Batinick said that politicians seeking to “climb the political ladder” benefit from running for office, but the risk of losing their current elected position is keeping Republicans from stepping into a race where their odds of winning are low in a state that leans left.
“Everybody has to give up what they got to run for something that they don’t think they can win,” he said. “They’re looking at a Trump midterm; they’re looking at a lack of money; they’re looking a lack of excitement at the top of the ticket for governor and senator to date.”
Batinick thinks the right Republican candidate can beat Gov. JB Pritzker and overcome his spending power.
“A Republican candidate is going to have to work hard on the ground and we’re going to have to band together to really match the money that he can just buy,” Batinick said. “Republicans are going to have to do it with volunteers. It’s possible, you just need somebody that is inspiring to the public.”
Other offices
In the Senate race, four Republicans have filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission and are actively raising money.
Former Illinois Republican Party Chair Don Tracy is reportedly considering running for either governor or Senate and is expected to make an announcement soon. Ted Dabrowski, the president of conservative research site Wirepoints, is also considering running for governor.

Bob Fioretti, who has unsuccessfully run for several offices as a member of both parties, is reportedly circulating petitions to run for attorney general.
But even as petition-gathering begins, no other candidates are publicly known to be interested in running for other statewide offices. Notable names, including U.S. Rep. Darin LaHood and former Illinois Republican National Committeeman Richard Porter have declined to run for governor or Senate.
Candidate recruitment isn’t the state party’s role but rather turning out voters, said Salvi, an attorney from Mundelein who was the party’s nominee for U.S. Senate in 2022.
Democrats’ national focus 
While Republicans head into the State Fair still in search of people to run for statewide office, Democrats have two primary elections for statewide offices and three crowded primaries for congressional seats in the Chicago area.
The primary for the open comptroller seat continues to expand. Rep. Stephanie Kifowit, D-Oswego, announced on Monday she will run for the seat, joining Rep. Margaret Croke, D-Chicago, and Lake County Treasurer Holly Kim in the race as other Democrats also consider jumping in.
But even as some Democrats gear up to compete against each other, much of the party’s focus this summer has been on national politics, including currently hosting Democrats in the Texas House who left their state to prevent a vote on redrawing Texas’ congressional maps.

After the Illinois Democratic Party hosted Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin last week for one of several news conferences in the western suburbs with Texas Democrats, the Illinois Democratic County Chairs’ Association will host U.S. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jefferies at their annual brunch on Wednesday in Springfield as part of State Fair festivities.
“Illinoisans face unprecedented harm from Donald Trump and Elon Musk and I cannot think of a better national leader right now to talk to our party about how to meet this moment,” association President Mark Guethle said in a statement.
Pritzker, who has put himself at the center of Texas’ redistricting fight, will also hold the governor’s traditional event at the State Fair on Wednesday afternoon. Pritzker has continued trying to grow his national profile this summer amid speculation he plans to run for president in 2028, including with an appearance on Stephen Colbert’s late-night show on CBS last week.
The Republicans will host FOX News analyst Gianno Caldwell as their keynote speaker at the fair on Thursday.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-11 16:10:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"NYC is nation’s capital of immigration courthouse arrests, analysis shows",Haidee Chu and Gwynne Hogan | THE CITY,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/11/nyc-immigration-courthouse-arrests-data-analysis/,"Half of all immigration courthouse arrests in the USearlier this summer took place in Manhattan, a new data analysis shows.","On a recent morning in Lower Manhattan, immigration Judge John Siemietkowski spoke to three people in his courtroom while masked federal officers waited just outside. 
“I’m sure you can see with your own eyes what’s going on in our courthouse,” Siemietkowski said. 
“You may see someone you know get arrested. You yourself may get arrested,” he warned. “That’s a heavy topic, isn’t it? A lot like the weather today. It’s heavy, and it weighs on us.”
Siemietkowski scheduled the three for court dates in 2026 and dismissed them. As they left the courtroom, two of them, a married couple from Panama, walked by the officers unimpeded. But when the third man, from the Dominican Republic, passed the officers, he was grabbed by the shoulders in plain view of Siemietkowski’s dais and escorted down a stairwell.
Such scenes have played out over and over again in the more than two months since officers from Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other federal law enforcement agencies began lurking in the fluorescent-lit corridors of the three Manhattan courthouses where immigrants in deportation proceedings plead their cases. 
Half of all immigration court arrests nationwide were in New York City in late May and early June, according to a new analysis of federal immigration court and ICE data by THE CITY and Joseph Gunther, a Brooklyn mathematician who first identified a method to track courthouse arrests. 

ICE officers elsewhere have been detaining thousands of people at workplaces, Home Depot parking lots and even sending militarized cavalry units through big city parks. But enforcement in New York City has been focused inside of the very buildings where people show up at civil immigration hearings to petition for the right to legally remain in the United States. It’s an approach that the agency had taken pains to avoid before Trump’s second term because of the deterrent effect it has on noncitizens with immigration court hearings. 
That changed dramatically in New York City this late spring. Between May 26 and June 8, court and ICE records show, federal officers arrested 134 people in Lower Manhattan immigration courthouse buildings, accounting for nearly a third of all immigration arrests in New York City in that period. 
Overall, immigration courthouse arrests have been nearly 14 times as common in New York City than the country as a whole. They made up 7% of all ICE arrests in the city since President Donal Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20 through June, compared to 0.5% nationally over the same period of time.
The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to THE CITY’s request for comment on the analysis, which cross-references Executive Office of Immigration Review (EOIR) court data with ICE arrest records to identify cases that show a court hearing on the same date as an arrest.
At the same time that courthouse arrests began ramping up, ICE also ratcheted up arrests at mandatory check-ins with the agency. Those arrests took place at offices like the one across the street from 26 Federal Plaza, where THE CITY witnessed 31 arrests over two days, as well as another office inside 26 Federal Plaza itself, where people line up each morning. Some never get to leave of their own accord.
Federal agents wait to detain people outside immigration courts at 26 Federal Plaza, Aug. 7, 2025.
As a result of the courthouse arrests ICE has emphasized in New York City, a large number of arrests here are happening behind closed doors — sparing Mayor Eric Adams the spectacle of roundups on city streets seen elsewhere in the country and the potential for clashes with New Yorkers. 
In Los Angeles, immigration arrests in highly visible public settings triggered sustained mass protests, leading President Trump to deploy the National Guard and then the Marines to assist ICE agents in June. Mayor Karen Bass described Los Angeles as “a city under siege, under armed occupation.” 
While smaller protests have been common, no such dramatic standoffs have occurred yet in New York City, where Adams has pledged to work with the Trump administration on matters that don’t involve civil immigration enforcement, taking a less adversarial approach to ICE than mayors in other Democratic strongholds.
In April, the Trump Justice Department dropped the criminal corruption case against Adams. Less than a day later, Adams, who was elected in 2021 as a Democrat, announced a longshot independent bid for a second term.
Missing Persons
EOIR data shows the surge in courthouse arrests kicked off nationally on May 19 and ramped up in New York City several days later. A former employee at the New York immigration court said that everyone — including Department of Homeland Security attorneys who serve as prosecutors inside the immigration court system — seemed surprised on the day in May when they first saw ICE agents in the hallways. 
Federal agents bring a couple onto an elevator at 26 Federal Plaza after they finished an immigration hearing, June 10, 2025.
“We had no notice this was happening, I don’t think the prosecutors had much notice either,” the former employee recalled, saying the DHS prosecutors had been ordered to come to the building in person instead of appearing virtually as they typically did. 
ICE agents had been in or near the courthouse before then — for example, if an immigrant had a serious criminal conviction that made them subject to rules requiring detention while a case proceeded. But that was exceedingly rare, the former EOIR employee said.
“Even that hadn’t happened in years,” the person said. “It’s never been anything like this.”
In New York City, 110 people were arrested on the same day as their immigration court hearing through June under the Trump administration, court data shows, accounting for 24% of the 453 such arrests nationwide. 
But ICE likely arrested even more people here in connection with court appearances. 
The agency’s own arrest data, when cross-referenced with court data, suggests at least another 71 people in New York City were detained on the same day as their hearing. That brings the number of total immigration court arrests in the city this year to 181 — a dramatic escalation from 11 arrests all of last year, including just three over the same time period. 
Taken together, the analysis found 31% of all ICE arrests in the city took place in immigration courts in the two weeks between May 26 and June 8, when courthouse arrests spiked across the country.

Other cities trailed far behind: San Diego was a distant second with 37 arrests, followed by 32 in Annandale, Va., and 29 in Newark, N. J., according to court data. 
In Los Angeles, where ICE arrests have also surged, EOIR records show only six arrests within its three immigration courts.
New York City’s courthouse arrests have exclusively targeted adults, and mostly men, records show, with the youngest confirmed arrest that of a 19-year-old Venezuelan teen, and the oldest a 63-year-old from Ecuador. 
Just three of the people arrested were represented by a lawyer. Many judges allow people with attorneys to appear virtually, leaving many without representation to face a gauntlet of masked ICE agents awaiting their arrival alone.

Even past the 181 arrests THE CITY identified in government records, our reporting found several additional arrests were not reflected in court records — highlighting that these preliminary tallies are undoubtedly an undercount. 
The arrest of 20-year-old high schooler Joselyn Chipantiza-Sisalema, who was taken from a court hearing in late June, for example, is not reflected in the current court data.
The court data also omits the detention of a 19-year-old man from Guinea who ICE records indicate was arrested on the same day as his court hearing at 26 Federal Plaza. He has since been transferred to a detention center in Jonesboro, Louisiana, where he was held for 26 days before being transferred to another detention facility in Elizabeth, New Jersey.
Black Box
The scene at the immigration courthouse on the 12th floor of 26 Federal Plaza on a recent morning showed the ICE arrest apparatus now well entrenched.
Judge James Loprest was out for the day, but many people with pending cases had dutifully shown up anyway. They took turns speaking to the clerk, who handed them notices to appear at a later date. But as they tried to leave, masked agents confronted them at the doorway asking for identification. 
Federal agents guard a stairwell while their colleagues detain people leaving immigration court inside 26 Federal Plaza, Aug. 7, 2025.
Agents whisked a 19-year-old girl into a stairwell for questioning before releasing her several minutes later. 
A woman who looked to be in her thirties, wearing gold high heels and a sparkly green jumpsuit, was not so lucky. The woman’s hands trembled as the agents towered over her. “But I haven’t done anything,” she said incredulously in Spanish, weeping softly and asking a volunteer stationed nearby to call her husband, who was waiting for her outside. 
“It’s not a question,” an agent said in Spanish with a thick American accent. “We said you’re leaving with us.” 
Moments later, the men surrounded the woman and rushed her to a back stairwell and out of sight. She — like the many others apprehended inside immigration courthouses at 26 Federal Plaza, 290 Broadway and on Varick Street — was detained for processing in the ICE office on the 10th floor of 26 Federal Plaza. As the number of arrests has soared in recent weeks, ICE has struggled to move people into actual detention centers, leaving some for days in cramped holding rooms with no beds and limited food.
On Friday, the ACLU sued the Trump Administration over conditions there. People haven’t been able to speak privately with lawyers, the lawsuit alleged, and are only given limited food and left to sleep for days on concrete floors in unsanitary conditions. DHS has flatly denied any mistreatment while repeatedly denying members of Congress access to the site, keeping it entirely out of public view until THE CITY first published videos of it in July. 
City Comptroller Brad Lander — who was arrested at 26 Federal Plaza in June while accompanying immigrants to their court appearances — was reluctant during his most recent visit on Thursday to speculate about why enforcement had taken such a different shape in New York.
“It’s one of the big questions,” Lander said, pointing to the public scenes of intimidation in Los Angeles.
Lander has called on Adams to enforce potential building and fire code violations on ICE’s detention floor, though Adams said he has no jurisdiction over the federal building. 
“It’s certainly possible that there’s some implicit deal between the Trump administration and Eric Adams, which is why these arrests are being concentrated here versus other places around the country,” Lander said when pressed about why enforcement here had been so different. 
“If the mayor wants to demonstrate that there isn’t, there’s a lot of ways for him to show he’s objecting to what’s going on here that he’s failed to do.”
Asked about Lander’s comments, Kayla Mamelak, a spokesperson for Adams, said that “I can’t tell you why they’re doing this at 26 Federal Plaza.” 
She said the mayor has been clear he’s open to working with the Trump administration on criminal matters but draws the line on civil immigration enforcement. She also noted New York City had not seen immigration raids in sensitive locations like churches and schools — something Adams had urged Homan against during their meetings.
“Not having an adversarial-at-all-times relationship can sometimes be beneficial,” said Mamelak.
The Trump administration sued the mayor and City Council in late July, demanding an end to sanctuary city laws that prohibit local government cooperation with civil immigration enforcement. The Adams administration is suing in return, including three lawsuits on behalf of students arrested at immigration court appearances.
“What’s going on at 26 Fed, the mayor opposes, and he’s taken action on that,” Mamelak said. 
Adams, however, has largely avoided answering questions or speaking on camera about those conditions. He has repeatedly stressed that the city isn’t responsible for what happens inside of the ICE offices, now including a jail, inside its real estate in Manhattan.
Meanwhile, ICE immigration court arrests continue day after day for people who continue to show up at their court appearances. 
‘Guiding Star’?
Courthouse arrests have mostly targeted people who entered the country less than two years ago, THE CITY’s analysis shows, confirming what the Trump administration has said is a new focus on attempting to funnel people into “expedited removal” proceedings that can circumvent immigration courts, which are facing historic backlogs and take years to resolve a person’s deportation case. 
But while DHS prosecutors regularly asked judges to dismiss a person’s deportation case ahead of their arrest, judges rarely approved those requests.
A family leaves an immigration hearing at 26 Federal Plaza after walking past federal agents, Aug. 7, 2025.
Government prosecutors had requested that judges dismiss the removal proceedings in 100 of the 181 instances where people were arrested on the day of their court hearing, THE CITY’s analysis shows. But judges denied 69 of those requests and left 23 of them undecided.  
That means only eight dismissals were approved — and that the other 173 people were arrested while their cases were still ongoing, forcing them to fight their asylum claims from behind bars in most cases.
“We very quickly saw on the ground that the procedural posture didn’t actually matter,” said Allison Cutler, supervising attorney at the New York Legal Assistance Group. She is one of a handful of attorneys keeping watch on the courthouse arrests, and attempts to advise people without lawyers of their rights as they’re rushed away.
Over the past two months, Cutler has become friendly with court staff, security guards, judges, and even the federal agents, who’ve all had their status quo upended by the arrests. 
Many agents, she pointed out, have been drafted from other agencies, including the U.S. Department of Treasury and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, to conduct courthouse arrests on behalf of ICE. 
“I’ve had multiple officers tell me that they’re gonna quit,” Cutler said, adding they’ve told her they’ve had to forgo working on prior investigations to arrest people inside courtrooms. “They have asked their supervisors if they can continue to work on their investigations, and they’re being told no, and that they have to go to court and do this.”
Meanwhile, immigration judges and court staff in New York are grappling with a grim new normal, with each of them struggling to work out the rules for their courtrooms.
A former New York immigration judge, who called fairness “the guiding star” of the system, called the shift in tactics deeply troubling and unprecedented. 
“Now you’re a tool in someone’s tool box so that a person can be detained,” the judge said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/080725_ice_arrests-3-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-11 12:59:03.351733

She fell over, got back up, and resumed working. She had 40-pound boxes of freshly packed chicken to carry roughly seven minutes from the line to the frying area.
The further along in her pregnancy, the harder it was to do her job – and the more scared she was for herself and her baby. She asked to be moved to a less intensive position for the rest of her pregnancy. Her supervisors refused.
She says they asked her to present a doctor’s note before they allowed her to take more bathroom breaks than the one per shift granted to all workers.
“They don’t move you to another position, even if you have a fever, even if you’re crying,” Maria said. “Because they say, ‘It’s your job, you already know your job.’” 
So she kept clocking in at 6 a.m. until she was eight-and-a-half months pregnant. 
Six years after Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids on seven Mississippi poultry plants brought national attention to an industry that had profited from undocumented labor for decades, more than a dozen current and former immigrant workers told Mississippi Today that deteriorated working conditions persist for undocumented employees as well as those with work permits or green cards. Most interviews were conducted in Spanish, with some workers’ first names changed and their last names not used because they feared retaliation and deportation.

ICE detained 680 mostly Latino workers in the August 2019 raids. The year prior, Koch Foods settled a class action lawsuit for $3.75 million. The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission charged the company with sexual harassment, national origin and race discrimination as well as retaliation against Latino workers at its Morton plant.
Following the raids, three plant managers and human resources staff were sentenced to up to two years of probation for knowingly “harboring illegal aliens.” 
Years later, loopholes persist. Several workers told Mississippi Today it is still possible to find employment in the chicken plants without work authorization, often using fake papers or a contractor.
This practice isn’t unique to Mississippi. In 2024, nationally, around 23% of workers in the meatpacking industry were undocumented and 42% were foreign-born, the American Immigration Council told Wired Magazine. Undocumented immigrants represent 4.6% of the U.S. employed labor force.
“They seek out the most vulnerable workers, who are not going to complain and not going to demand better conditions,” said Debbie Berkowitz, a former policy adviser for Occupational Safety and Health Administration and worker safety expert who has written about the poultry industry.

Before obtaining a work permit in 2021 and finding employment in a Tyson plant, Gabby worked for two other poultry processing companies under a fake name. She paid a U.S. citizen $1,700 to use the person’s Social Security number and name at work.
Koch Foods, her first employer, hired her in 2006 through a third party. The only form of identification required was that Social Security number. 
Her contractor, a single person who operated through word of mouth, didn’t provide her with a contract – only paying her cash. When he held her pay for over a month, Gabby complained to plant managers. They said her salary wasn’t processed through the plant’s payroll department and they were not accountable.
“The first thing most people think is, if I speak up, ICE is going to come for me,” Gabby said. “The last thing you want to do is create problems. What you want to do is work.” 
In order to keep her job, she had to lie and maintain a fake identity. She lived in fear of being found out.
“You go to work with fear, you go with shame,” she said.
Working with fake papers can make getting a doctor’s excuse for missed days nearly impossible. Maria was able to get six weeks of unpaid maternity leave with a doctor’s note because she worked under her real name, but other pregnant women needed a doctor who agreed to forge their fake name on medical records.
Gabby says she was fired from her job at Koch Foods because she gave the contact information of a willing doctor to other undocumented workers. Koch Foods didn’t answer multiple requests for comment on allegations made by workers.
Past the limit
Across all assembly lines, the piece rate – the number of chickens that workers handle per minute –  directly affects the likelihood of developing pains or muscle and bone injuries, a study funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture found. Only the evisceration line speed, or the phase where chickens are killed, is federally regulated. Piece rate is determined mainly by the job-specific line speed and staffing level.
The same study found that 81% of U.S. poultry plant workers had an “unacceptably high” risk of musculoskeletal disease. To mitigate that risk, authors recommended increasing staffing levels and decreasing line speeds.
But several workers said line speeds were used to increase pressure on employees. Miguel, an 18-year Koch Foods employee, claims he was pushed to resign within months by a supervisor who continuously increased line speeds as punishment.
He started in 2000 in the debone section, cutting chicken parts from hanging carcasses, then became a lead person. For an additional $1 per hour, he was watching over two lines of 30 workers in total. He says he was demoted by this new supervisor who took a dislike to him.
The supervisor would single him and another employee out, place them on another line and speed it up. 
“He told me he wanted us to do double duty: What four people were doing, he wanted two to do,” Miguel said.
After three failed attempts to report the situation to managers, Miguel quit and found work in construction. Koch Foods did not provide comment on how line speeds are set and managed at the plant. 
Every worker interviewed described as routine hostility from supervisors and managers, harassment and arbitrary punishments targeting immigrant workers. 
“I feel like it doesn’t matter if you speak English or not, they’re going to look at you ugly. They treat you wrong just because they feel they have that authority, that they’re the boss,” said Sofi, a recipient of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. She started working at Koch Foods in February and quit after four months.
Injured and fired
Annual employee turnover averages 65% but ranges as high as 150% in poultry plants nationally, according to a survey by the U.S. Poultry and Egg Association. Over half of employees last less than three months on the job. 
Employees told Mississippi Today that almost anything can be grounds for termination. Half of the dozen workers interviewed said they witnessed or experienced layoffs following an injury on the job.
Repeating the same motions hundreds of times a day, for years, can lead to chronic pains and eventually injuries. Maribel, a 17-year Koch Foods employee, tucked chicken wings for eight years with an overstretched tendon in her hand. With the pain on her mind, she says she was terminated in March after she requested to not be moved to the more intensive deboning section, where workers handle large metallic scissors.
Idalia, a green card holder, says Tyson Foods fired her after she reported a dislocated shoulder with a doctor’s note in 2023. She marinated chicken, a job that requires repetitive hand and arm movements. She now works for Koch Foods, where she packs boxes of chicken with growing pain in her hand from knocking her hands against tape dispensers and frozen chicken six days a week.

Poultry plants are required to report injuries needing treatment beyond first aid or resulting in lost work days to OSHA. Lost work days must also be reported to the Mississippi Workers’ Compensation Commission.
Mississippi law states that all injured workers, regardless of immigration status, are entitled to workers’ compensation, and medical and wage loss benefits, even if they get fired following the injury.
However, undocumented workers are less likely to claim the benefits, due to a lack of information and fear that drawing attention to themselves could lead to deportation.
Several employees told Mississippi Today that some plants found a way around reporting injuries to OSHA.

A bad fall on his hips in a Koch Foods plant injured Miguel enough that he couldn’t work for two weeks. While recovering, he came in every day, clocked in and out at his regular hours, pretending to be working as usual. For the entirety of his shift, he sat in the rest area.
His managers said it was the only way he could get paid while he was injured.
Three workers interviewed said they witnessed injured employees sitting all day in the cafeteria or their supervisor’s office. Koch did not respond to a request for comment.
“I think not wanting folks to report is an OSHA question, and then not wanting folks to get access to medical care and disability benefits is a money question,” said Angela Stuesse, author of  “Scratching Out a Living: Latinos, Race, and Work in the Deep South,” based on years of ethnographic research in Mississippi’s poultry region.
Exposed to hazards
Ninety-one severe injuries were reported in Mississippi’s poultry plants in the last 10 years, and 35 workers suffered amputations. Poultry workers nationally suffer occupational injuries and illnesses six times more often than other workers, according to 2016 data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
But the prevalence of injuries in the industry is not a natural consequence of handling dangerous machines, tools or chemicals. Berkowitz argues it is the result of companies purposefully cutting corners to save money.
“All injuries are preventable,” she said. “It’s all about profits, and they’re making huge profits.”
Tyson Foods, the biggest chicken producer in the U.S., reported $16.4 billion in chicken sales in 2024. 
The sanitation shift, which takes place at night and is mostly staffed by undocumented workers, is the most dangerous, Berkowitz says. Workers clean the blood and guts out of machines, using high pressure hoses and corrosive chemicals. But some poultry companies use sanitation subcontractors to clean their plants, escaping some liability for what happens on the shift.
“This is really a way to outsource their obligation to protect workers,” Berkowitz said.
Although company employees still oversee operations, subcontractors are responsible for hiring workers and providing them adequate equipment and training.
Quality Service Integrity, a sanitation company contracted by Tyson Foods, was fined $10,000 in June 2024 for making workers pay to replace their damaged protective equipment, like chemical suits and safety glasses, in a Tyson plant in Carthage – a violation of OSHA standards. 
The same investigation also found that the plant did not have an infirmary or a person trained to perform first aid.
Baldomero Orozco, an employee with a work permit who cleaned Tyson’s Carthage plant at night, had filed a complaint against Quality Service Integrity to OSHA before the inspection.
“We have strict policies in place across all facilities to ensure full compliance with all applicable workplace regulations,” a Tyson Foods spokesperson told Mississippi Today in a statement. Quality Service Integrity did not reply to a request for comment.

The same year, Orozco filed another complaint against Peco Foods in Sebastopol, his previous employer, claiming they charged him for tools and other equipment required for the job. He told Mississippi Today he spent roughly $150 on tools alone. 
“The company didn’t take responsibility for anything for us,” he said. “We had to buy our tools, the wrenches, everything you use to remove a screw.”
Peco Foods had previously been fined $6,000 in May 2023 for failing to replace workers’ equipment at no cost.

Enforcement failures
Occasional citations might be one-time victories for workers, but Orozco says they do not lead to long-term improvement.
“When OSHA came by, things did calm down, more or less. But after a couple days, the same things started happening, because OSHA never followed up on the case,” he said.
Quality Service Integrity’s operations with Tyson in Carthage have not been inspected again since the citation was issued.
OSHA’s data reveals that inspections in Mississippi’s poultry plants are scarce. Tyson Foods plants were not inspected for four years before Orozco’s filing. Koch Foods was inspected twice in the past five years.
A report published by a federation of labor unions in April stated it would take 243 years for Mississippi’s seven OSHA inspectors to visit every workplace once.
“Most workplaces never see OSHA unless a complaint is filed, or a worker is killed, or there are very serious injuries that are reported,” Berkowitz said in an email.
Nine of the 20 inspections performed by OSHA in Mississippi’s poultry plants in the past five years were initiated by a worker complaint. Mar-Jac poultry plants were inspected three times following the death of a worker in three years – and fined $163,759 in 2023 after the death of a 16 year-old on the job.
“OSHA’s top priority for inspection is an imminent danger –- a situation where workers face an immediate risk of death or serious physical harm,” a Department of Labor spokesperson said. Second priority goes to fatalities or accidents where three or more workers are hospitalized. Employee complaints come next, the spokesperson said. 
OSHA typically does not give advance notice of an inspection, except in certain specific situations. But when OSHA inspectors come unannounced, plant managers can refuse to let them in and ask them to come back with a warrant.

Maria, who resigned from her job at Peco Foods in Sebastopol after she broke her spine in a car accident in December 2022, is unable to work today. Because she got injured on her way to work, she was eligible for workers’ compensation. But she never claimed it, in fear of upsetting her employer.
“I was scared,” she said. “What if they call the police or ICE on me?”
Awaiting surgery in hopes of getting fully back on her feet, Maria struggles to make ends meet for herself and the three children she’s raising alone. 
“I don’t have a work permit, I’m just another immigrant, but I fight. I fight every day to raise my children. I don’t depend on the government,” she said.

ProPublica is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative newsroom. Sign up for The Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox.Veterans hospitals are struggling to replace hundreds of doctors and nurses who have left the health care system this year as the Trump administration pursues its pledge to simultaneously slash Department of Veterans Affairs staff and improve care.Many job applicants are turning down offers, worried that the positions are not stable and uneasy with the overall direction of the agency, according to internal documents examined by ProPublica. The records show nearly 4 in 10 of the roughly 2,000 doctors offered jobs from January through March of this year turned them down. That is quadruple the rate of doctors rejecting offers during the same time period last year.The VA in March said it intended to cut its workforce by at least 70,000 people. The news sparked alarm that the cuts would hurt patient care, prompting public reassurances from VA Secretary Doug Collins that front-line health care staff would be immune from the proposed layoffs.Last month, department officials updated their plans and said they would reduce the workforce by 30,000 by the end of the fiscal year, which is Sept. 30. So many staffers had left voluntarily, the agency said in a press release, that mass layoffs would not be necessary.“VA is headed in the right direction,” Collins said in a statement.But a review of hundreds of internal staffing records, along with interviews with veterans and employees, reveal a far less rosy picture of how staffing is affecting veterans’ care.After six years of adding medical staff, the VA this year is down more than 600 doctors and about 1,900 nurses. The number of doctors on staff has declined each month since President Donald Trump took office. The agency also lost twice as many nurses as it hired between January and June, records viewed by ProPublica show.In response to questions, a VA spokesperson did not dispute numbers about staff losses at centers across the country but accused ProPublica of bias and of “cherry-picking issues that are mostly routine.”Agency spokesperson Peter Kasperowicz said that the department is “working to address” the number of doctors declining job offers by speeding up the hiring process and that the agency “has several strategies to navigate shortages,” including referring veterans to private providers and telehealth appointments. A nationwide shortage of health care workers has made hiring and retention difficult, he said.Kasperowicz said that the recent changes at the agency have not compromised care and that wait times are getting better after worsening under President Joe Biden.While wait times for primary, mental health and specialty care for existing patients did increase during Biden’s presidency, the VA’s statistics show only slight reductions since Trump took office in January.However, appointment wait times for new patients seeking primary and specialty care have slightly increased, according to a report obtained by ProPublica.As of early July, the average wait time nationally to schedule outpatient surgery appointments for new patients was 41 days, which is 13 days higher than the goal set by the VA and nearly two days longer than a year ago.In some locations, the waits for appointments are even longer.At the Togus VA Medical Center in Augusta, Maine, internal records show that there is a two-month wait for primary care appointments, which is triple the VA’s goal and 38 days longer than it was at this time last year. The wife of a disabled Marine veteran who receives care at the facility told ProPublica that it has become harder in recent months to schedule appointments and to get timely care.Her husband, she said, served in Somalia and is completely disabled. He has not had a primary care doctor assigned to him for months after his previous doctor left over the winter, she said.“He has no person who is in charge of his health care,” said the woman, who did not want to be named because of fears her comments might affect benefits for her husband. “It was never like this before. There’s a lack of staff, empty rooms, locked doors. It feels like something that’s not healthy.”Kasperowicz said the VA is taking “aggressive action” to recruit primary care doctors in Maine and anticipates hiring two new doctors by the end of the year.Nationwide, records reviewed by ProPublica show, the vacancy rate for doctors at the VA was 13.7% in May, up from 12% in May of 2024. Kasperowicz said those rates are in line with historical averages for the agency. But while the vacancy rate decreased over the first five months of 2024, it has risen in 2025.Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., who has been critical of Collins’ stewardship, has argued that the VA is heading in a dangerous new direction. He said that ProPublica’s findings reinforce his concerns about “damaging and dangerous impacts” from cuts and staffing reductions.“Dedicated professionals are fleeing — and recruitment is flagging — because of toxic work conditions and draconian funding cuts and firings,” he told ProPublica. “We’ve warned repeatedly about these results — shocking, but not surprising.”In the VA’s Texas region, which covers most of the state, officials reported in an internal presentation in June that approximately 90 people had turned down job offers “due to the uncertainty of reorganization” and noted that low morale was causing existing employees to not recommend working at the medical centers.Anthony Martinez, a retired Army captain who did tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan, said he has witnessed a downgrade in care at the Temple, Texas, VA facility. He said that the hospital has lost records of his recent allergy shots, which he now has to repeat, and he has to wait longer for appointments.“Problems have always existed but not to this degree,” Martinez said.Martinez, who runs a local nonprofit for veterans, said he’s heard similar frustrations from many of them. “It’s not just me. Many vets are having bad experiences,” he said.Kasperowicz said the agency couldn’t discuss Martinez’s case without a patient privacy waiver, which Martinez declined to sign. He said wait times for primary care appointments for existing patients at Temple are unchanged over the past fiscal year. But internal records show an increase in wait times for new patients in specialties such as cardiology, gastroenterology and oncology.Administrators there have expressed concern about the impact of staff losses, warning in their June internal presentation about “institutional knowledge leaving the Agency due to the increase of supervisors departing.”It is not just the loss of doctors and nurses impacting care. Shortages in support staff, who have not been protected from cuts, are also adding to delays.In Dayton, Ohio, vacant positions for purchasing agents resulted in delays in acquiring hundreds of prosthetics, according to an internal VA report from May. Kasperowicz said the hospital has recently cut processing time for such orders by more than half.Some facilities are experiencing trouble hiring and keeping mental health staff.In February, a human resources official in the VA region covering much of Florida reported in an internal warning system that the area was having trouble hiring mental health professionals to treat patients in rural areas. The jobs had previously been entirely remote but now require providers to be on site at a clinic.When the region offered jobs to three mental health providers, all of them declined. The expected impact, according to the warning document, was longer delays for appointments. Kasperowicz said the VA is working to address the shortages.Yet even as the agency faces these challenges, the Trump administration has dramatically scaled back the use of a key tool designed to help the VA attract applicants and plug gaps in critical front-line care.The VA in recent years has used incentive payments to help recruit and keep doctors and other health care workers. In fiscal 2024, the agency paid nearly 20,000 staffers retention bonuses and over 6,000 new hires got signing bonuses. In the first nine months of this fiscal year, which started Oct. 1, only about 8,000 VA employees got retention bonuses and just over 1,000 received recruitment incentives. The VA has told lawmakers it has been able to fill jobs without using the incentive programs.Rep. Delia Ramirez, D-Ill., said during a congressional oversight hearing in July that the Trump administration is withholding the bonuses because it “wants them to leave” as part of a plan to privatize services.“It’s not that VA employees are less meritorious than they were under Biden,” she said. “They want every employee to be pushed out so they can decimate the VA’s workforce.”Do you have information about the VA that we should know about?

(Maya Smith for Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach says he keeps a box of naloxone in his pickup truck.
It’s a lifesaving tool that can fit in the glovebox, and Kobach wants to make the product more accessible to Kansans.
Naloxone, also known by the brand name Narcan, is an overdose-reversal medication that can restore someone’s breathing within minutes and is known for its effectiveness in combating the opioid epidemic.
A state grant review board unanimously approved Friday a $177,000 grant for the Attorney General’s Office to transform unused news racks into naloxone distribution boxes.
“If you’re willing to keep it in your glovebox in your car, you should be doing that, because we need it distributed everywhere to potentially save lives,” Kobach said at a Friday meeting of the Kansas Fights Addiction Grant Review Board.
The idea was inspired by Emily’s Hope, an organization in South Dakota that says it was the first in the nation to repurpose news racks to increase access to naloxone and reduce the stigma around drug use. The program has been “extremely successful,” said Angela Kennecke, president and CEO of Emily’s Hope. Since April, the organization has established 25 open boxes in 11 cities, and it is working on 12 more. That has amounted to roughly 8,200 kits distributed.
“I thought we should be doing the same thing,” Kobach said.
He wants to place repurposed newspaper boxes on college and university campuses, of which there are about 40 in Kansas.
Kobach’s request focused on illegally made fentanyl, a potent synthetic opioid that caused more than half of overdose deaths in 2023 in Kansas, according to the most recent data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Kansas recently surpassed 1,500 total deaths from fentanyl, he said. Of the 615 overdose deaths in Kansas in 2023, nearly 60% had at least one potential opportunity for intervention, the data said. In almost 45% of deaths, a bystander was present.
Pat George, the board chair, said the overdose crisis is happening now.
“Our primary mission, I’ve always felt, is saving lives and saving families, so this fits right in,” George said.
The addiction grant review board is charged with deciding where to allocate the millions of dollars that have poured into the state from settlements with pharmaceutical companies, which were sued for playing a part in the opioid epidemic. Kansas has received $90 million to date, said Shanna Zimmer, chief financial officer of the Sunflower Foundation, a nonprofit that administers the funds for the state. About $74 million remains in the bank.
The attorney general envisioned the grant paying for public service announcements, social media and video advertising, distribution boxes and 7,000 boxes of naloxone, each typically containing two doses. The majority of the grant, about $150,000, will be for advertising, Kobach said.
Education is a significant piece, he said, because of the pervasive nature of fentanyl. It appears in counterfeit pills, often mixed with other drugs.
A Douglas County-based social services organization, DCCCA, runs the Kansas Naloxone Program. It has placed five vending machines across the state that distribute naloxone like bags of chips or candy bars. Three more are on the way, said Chrissy Mayer, chief community-based services officer for DCCCA.
Between October and June, the organization distributed about 40,000 kits of naloxone across Kansas, either through vending machines or by mail. That’s 80,000 doses.
“We know that overdoses continue to increase, and this is a really easy way to save someone’s life,” Mayer said.

The organization places boxes at locations in Hutchinson, Lawrence, Kansas City, Kansas, Salina and Wichita, based on data mapping overdose hotspots. New machines are expected soon in Garden City, Overland Park and Pittsburg.
People who want naloxone from one of DCCCA’s machines enter their zip code on a keypad, then the machine dispenses a kit, Mayer said. The machine in Wichita is typically restocked weekly. In Hutchinson, it’s restocked about every two weeks, and the rest are usually restocked once a month.
Mayer said “there are some interesting assumptions that people might make” regarding who uses the vending machines. Many who use the vending machines are from what might be classified as more affluent ZIP codes, she said.
“That just demonstrates opioid overdose affects everybody,” Mayer said.
She added: “Your ZIP code doesn’t really matter.”
DCCCA offers multiple training options on its website for the proper administration of naloxone.

(Photo by Amanda Hernández/Stateline)For years, state lawmakers have taken the lead on regulating kratom — the controversial herbal supplement used for pain relief, anxiety and opioid withdrawal symptoms. Some states have banned it entirely. Others have passed laws requiring age limits, labeling and lab testing.
At least half of the states and the District of Columbia have enacted some form of regulation on kratom or its components — building a patchwork of policies around a product largely unaddressed by the federal government.
But that may soon change. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is pushing to ban 7-hydroxymitragynine, or 7-OH — a powerful compound found in small amounts in kratom and sometimes concentrated or synthesized in products sold online, at smoke shops or behind gas station counters.
Federal health officials announced last month that the compound poses serious public health risks and should be classified as a Schedule I controlled substance, alongside heroin and LSD.
The move marks a significant shift in how federal regulators are approaching kratom, which they attempted to ban in 2016. It also has sparked debate about how the change could impact the growing 7-OH industry and its consumers.
This year, at least seven states have considered bills to tighten kratom regulations, including proposals for bans, age restrictions and labeling requirements.
Kratom, which originates from the leaves of a tree native to Southeast Asia, can have a wide range of mental and bodily effects, according to federal officials, addiction medicine specialists and kratom researchers. Reports of fatal kratom overdoses have surfaced in recent years, though kratom is often taken in combination with other substances.
Kratom and 7-OH are distinct products with separate markets, but they are closely connected. 7-OH is a semi-synthetic compound derived from kratom and only emerged on the market in late 2023, while kratom itself has been available for decades.










This is a public health crisis waiting to happen. 


– Christopher R. McCurdy, professor of medicinal chemistry at the University of Florida


Leading kratom researchers also say more research is needed to fully understand the long-term effects of using both substances.
“There’s much we don’t know, unfortunately, on all sides,” said Christopher R. McCurdy, a professor of medicinal chemistry at the University of Florida. McCurdy is a trained pharmacist and has studied kratom for more than 20 years.
Research suggests kratom may help with opioid withdrawal and doesn’t seem to cause severe withdrawal on its own. Smaller amounts seem to act as a stimulant, while larger doses may have sedative, opioidlike effects. Very little is known about the risks of long-term use in humans, according to McCurdy.
As for 7-OH, it shows potential for treating pain, but it hasn’t been studied in humans, and it may carry a high risk of addiction. Researchers don’t yet understand how much is safe to take or how often it should be used, McCurdy told Stateline.
While some leading kratom experts agree that kratom and 7-OH should be regulated, they caution that placing 7-OH under a strict Schedule I classification would make it much harder to study — and argue it should instead be classified as Schedule II like some other opioids.
A federal survey from 2023 estimated that about 1.6 million Americans age 12 and older used kratom in the year before the study. The American Kratom Association, a national industry lobbying group, estimated in 2021 that between 11 million and 16 million Americans safely consume kratom products each year.
Since gaining popularity in recent years, 7-OH has appeared in a growing number of products. Some researchers and addiction medicine specialists say many consumers, especially those new to kratom, sometimes don’t understand the difference between products.
“It’s a pure opioid that’s available without a prescription, so it’s akin to having morphine or oxycodone for sale at a smoke shop or a gas station,” McCurdy said. “This is a public health crisis waiting to happen.”
Federal crackdown targets 7-OH, not kratom
In late July, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommended that the federal Drug Enforcement Administration place 7-OH in Schedule I, citing a high potential for abuse. The classification would not apply to kratom leaves or powders with naturally occurring 7-OH.
“We’re not targeting the kratom leaf or ground-up kratom,” FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said at a news conference. “We are targeting a concentrated synthetic byproduct that is an opioid.”
Makary acknowledged that there isn’t enough research or data to fully understand how widespread 7-OH’s use or impact may be. Still, he said the Trump administration wants to be “aggressive and proactive” in addressing the issue before it grows into a larger public health problem.

While only small amounts of 7-OH occur naturally in the kratom plant, federal officials have raised concerns about U.S. products containing synthetic or concentrated forms of the compound because it’s more potent than morphine and primarily responsible for kratom’s opioidlike effects.
The FDA’s recommendation to schedule 7-OH will now go to the DEA, which oversees the final steps of the process — including issuing a formal proposal and opening a public comment period.
If finalized, the rule could affect both companies selling enhanced kratom products and consumers in states where those products are currently legal.
The DEA backed off scheduling kratom compounds in 2016 after widespread public opposition.
Kirsten Smith, an assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Johns Hopkins University who is studying kratom’s effects in humans, said she was surprised by the FDA’s push to schedule 7-OH.
“We don’t really have a public health signal of a lot of adverse events for either kratom or for 7-OH at this time,” she told Stateline. “I was, frankly, always surprised that kratom was pushed toward scheduling at an earlier time point. … I don’t know that we have data to support scheduling even now.”
Still, some advocacy groups, including the Holistic Alternative Recovery Trust, argue the push to schedule 7-OH is driven more by corporate interests than public health, suggesting the kratom industry is trying to sideline competition from 7-OH products.
“We think that this is just happening because of the legacy kratom manufacturers losing market share and wanting to gin up a crisis with this,” said Jeff Smith, the national policy director for the group, who said he has used 7-OH for sleep and pain management.
While his organization supports regulation and safe consumption, members worry the federal government’s move could drive people to riskier substances or push the market underground.
“It’s made a profound difference in my life,” Smith said. “We think it would be tragic to cut it off based on such a paucity of data when there’s so much potential for this product to help people.”
Public health concerns
Federal health officials say a key concern is the growing use of kratom and 7-OH products among teens and young adults.
Some officials and addiction medicine specialists have pointed out that these products often come in flavors and packaging designed to appeal to younger buyers, with few controls over where or how they’re sold. In some states without clear regulations, kratom and 7-OH products are available at gas stations or online, sometimes without any age verification.

“Whenever you go into a gas station and even though it’s behind the glass, it’s kind of eye level, and it has all of these bright colors — it has all of these things that really attract the visual of a kiddo,” said Socorro Green, a prevention specialist with Youth180, a nonprofit focused on youth substance use prevention in Dallas.
Green added that kratom and 7-OH products may be even more accessible to young people in rural communities, where gas stations and convenience stores are often among the few available retailers.
Some researchers and experts say that certain products may not clearly or accurately disclose their 7-OH content and are sometimes marketed or mistaken for traditional kratom.

Some cities, counties and states have responded by banning kratom or raising the minimum purchase age to 18 or 21. But in many areas, enforcement remains inconsistent, and some addiction specialists say clearer federal and state guidance is needed — especially as more people are using kratom and 7-OH to manage pain, anxiety or withdrawal symptoms on their own.
“There needs to be some kind of oversight, including some way of maybe helping to ensure that people know what they’re getting,” said Terrence Walton, the executive director and chief executive officer of NAADAC, the Association for Addiction Professionals.
State regulations
At least seven states have considered or enacted legislation this year related to kratom — ranging from age restrictions and labeling requirements to outright bans.
In New York, lawmakers passed two bills: one requiring warning labels and prohibiting kratom products from being labeled as “all natural,” and another raising the minimum purchase age to 21. Neither has been sent to the governor.
In Colorado, a new measure, which was signed into law in May, prohibits kratom from being sold in forms that resemble candy or appeal to children, increases labeling requirements, limits concentrations of 7-OH, and bans the manufacture and distribution of synthetic or semi-synthetic kratom.
In Mississippi, a new law that took effect in July raised the minimum purchase age for kratom to 21. It also bans synthetic kratom extracts and products with high concentrations of 7-OH. Lawmakers in Montana and Texas introduced similar legislation this year, but neither proposal advanced.
Louisiana is the latest state to enact a kratom ban, which took effect Aug. 1. Meanwhile, in July, Rhode Island became the first state to reverse its ban. The new law establishes a regulatory framework for the manufacturing, sale and distribution of kratom products, set to take effect in April 2026.
As of this year, Washington, D.C., and seven states — Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Louisiana, Rhode Island (until April 2026), Vermont and Wisconsin — have banned kratom. At least half of U.S. states now regulate kratom or its components in some way.

VP Vance meets with Indiana GOP leadership on redistricting; Democrats denounce effort

The 4th congressional district, currently held by U.S. Rep. Jim Baird, stretches from Martinsville — southwest of Indianapolis — at its southern tip up past Lafayette to DeMotte, which is south of Gary, sharing much of its western border with Illinois.
Baird hasn’t yet announced whether not he’ll run in 2026, though Haggard has openly questioned whether Baird has tried to prop up his son, Beau Baird, as his successor in the district. Haggard also floated the possibility of a run in 2024, opting against it when Baird announced his reelection campaign.
However, the possibility of mid-cycle redistricting could fundamentally alter the direction of any 2026 congressional campaigns — even potentially drawing Haggard’s Mooresville home out of the 4th district. Technically, congressmen don’t have to live in the district they represent.
Seeking to grow his historically slim Republican majority in Congress, President Donald Trump has pressured GOP-led states to redistrict ahead of the traditional timeline to grow his party’s control. Democratic states have vowed to retaliate, potentially disrupting maps nationwide.
Republicans seeking to weaken the Democratic hold over the 7th congressional district in Indianapolis may mean redrawing the boundary to include Hoosiers in the redder doughnut counties, such as Haggard’s Mooresville hometown. Sitting U.S. Rep. André Carson has said he will run for reelection wherever his district’s new boundaries may be — but adding the residents of Indianapolis may dilute some of the ruby red districts elsewhere in the state.
Additionally, the 4th district adjoins the 1st district, another Democratic seat targeted by Republicans. It’s unclear if Hoosier Republicans will bow to Trump and redistrict the state, but doing so would transform the district Haggard seeks to win.
In response to questions about redistricting, Haggard iterated his belief in the district’s conservative bend, saying he didn’t think there was an “appetite for redistricting.”
“Indiana is a solid Republican state, It has voted for Trump 3 times already and I think proof of Indiana being conservative is our super majority. I have been hearing from constituents and I do not believe at this time there is an appetite for redistricting in our communities. I still plan on running in the 4th regardless, where I have met with tens of thousands of voters the last two years and where I plan to represent them in Congress if I am elected,” Haggard said.

The nonprofit was founded to mend the historical rift caused by enslavement, as well as to address the ensuing human rights violations and culture of white supremacy. 
Through community networking and collaboration, the organization seeks to facilitate reparations through a faith-based model. The Justice League’s president and co-founder Prince Solace explained that the Reparations Fund comprises payments from churches and individuals in Greater Lansing, as well as donations from Black advocates.

Solace added that these scholarships– and the Reparations Fund from which they’re sourced– are the product of “intergenerational and cross-racial and cross-denominational support stemming primarily from Greater Lansing, but also from beyond our community.”
 “Centuries of systemic inequalities in the U.S. have strongly negatively affected African Americans’ ability to accumulate wealth and have created a racial wealth gap,” Willye Bryan,  the Justice League’s vice president and co-founder, said.  “The social and financial cost to Black Americans continues to be great. The time to address these disparities is now.”

Applicants were asked to discuss these disparities in their essays, examining how they and their families have been impacted by the gaps in racial or generational wealth. 
Indeed, for many of the winners, the scholarship offered not only a means of reparation, but recognition of their own hardships, histories, and hopes. 
“Economically, the [racial wealth] gap means that I move through life with far less ease than wealth provides,” Corinne Williams Hough, a student at East Lansing High School, said. “Wealth creates a soft landing, a margin of error, a set of options. It provides breathing room, a buffer that allows people to imagine, explore, and sometimes even fail without losing too much ground. As I get older, I realize that is not a luxury I have been given.”
Similarly, Malachi Turner of Lansing delved into the history of financial discrimination— particularly policies like redlining. 
“I was shocked to learn how these practices still affect communities today,” Turner explained. “Through conversations with my parents, I began to see how systemic inequality continues to shape the lives of families who are still trying to catch up economically.”
For recipient Talia Dunn, these realities have been a motivating force.
“These challenges have made me more aware and resilient, and I am determined to break the cycle,” she said.

Ten scholarships of $2,500 were awarded to college-bound students in the Greater Lansing area. Eligible applicants were descendants of enslaved African Americans and residents of Ingham, Eaton or Clinton counties.
In addition to the essays, the recipients— Elaina Andrews, Jourdyn Carter, Karrington Cosey, Talia Dunn​​​​​, Ryleigh Lewis, Cameron Minor, Gabrielle Pruitt, Markell Richardson, Malachi Turner, and Corinne Williams-Hough— were selected based on their grades and interviews.

Progressives and voting rights advocates are divided on whether California and New York should fight the Texas power grab by gerrymandering their own states, creating more safe Democratic seats, even if that means undermining fair maps and the authority of those states’ nonpartisan redistricting commissions.
In Wisconsin, which just got out from under one of the worst partisan gerrymanders in the U.S., and the impenetrable, outsized Republican majorities in the state Legislature it protected for a decade and a half, this issue hits particularly close to home.
It’s head-spinning to hear arguments for Democratic counter-gerrymandering in other states from the same people in Wisconsin who were recently crying out for fair maps.
If Democrats are going to mount a serious challenge to the fascist takeover of our country by Trump and his minions, it’s hard to see how ceding the moral high ground and running roughshod over the principle that the will of the majority of voters should prevail is going to help.










If we want democracy, fairness, and the rule of law, we need to champion, well, democracy, fairness and the rule of law.


I get that it’s more satisfying to imagine a quick fix to the fascist takeover of every branch of government than to listen to a lot of vague talk about long-term plans to rebuild democracy. After all, election deniers and the architects of the Jan. 6 attack are now running the federal government, demanding access to voter lists across the country and deploying the FBI to arrest political opponents, including the Texas Democrats who’ve fled their state to stall the gerrymandering scheme there.
But here in Wisconsin, where we’ve just finally beaten back the most gerrymandered map in the country, it’s depressing to imagine Democrats abandoning the high ground and scrambling to do exactly what Republicans did when they controlled all three branches of government, attempting to lock in permanent political control against the will of the people.
If we want democracy, fairness, and the rule of law, we need to champion, well, democracy, fairness and the rule of law.
In this most extreme political moment, with every public institution and the continued existence of U.S. democracy in doubt, I understand why the long view frustrates people. The emergency is now. I understand that many voters want to see Democrats “fight fire with fire,” as Newsom put it.
But consider this: Republicans control more state legislatures (28 Republican versus 18 controlled by Democrats) and have trifecta control of all branches of government in more states (23 all-GOP states versus 15 all-Democratic). JD Vance just launched a tour of Republican states to encourage more mid-decade gerrymandering. And Trump wants to hold a new census for the purpose of redefining who can vote. Even if Democratic Govs. Gavin Newsom and Kathy Hochul succeed in gerrymandering California and New York, Democrats are not likely to win the nationwide redistricting war.
Meanwhile, democracy will be the first casualty of that war. California and New York would have to suspend the work of their nonpartisan redistricting commissions — the gold standard for fair, nonpartisan map-drawing — and take back partisan control of the process in order to carry out their threats. If they succeed, it is beyond unlikely that the politicians who pull off that short-term victory will ever cede back their power over the voting maps to the nonpartisan commissions again.
On a deeper level, the Democratic gerrymandering fantasy takes the whole movement to oppose Trump in exactly the wrong direction. Instead of building grassroots support to counter an unpopular, authoritarian leader, it rigs the system to benefit a party whose whole problem is that it has lost the broad, popular support it needs to win elections and create a better, more enlightened government.
Instead of trying to rig the maps to ensure a Democratic House majority in the next election, Democrats need to focus on winning elections and flipping seats in areas of the rural and industrial Midwest that were once reliably blue but have turned deep red.
To do that they need to make the case that health care, education and an adequate social safety net are bedrock rights in the richest nation on earth, and that we should not be giving tax breaks to billionaires by taking food out of the mouths of hungry children.
They need to offer something to the farmers and factory workers and disaffected voters in rural and urban areas alike that is clearly different and better than the hate, corruption, and a determination to run roughshod over democracy that Republicans offer.
In Wisconsin, voting rights groups have been working on a campaign to push through a constitutional amendment modeled on one in our neighboring state of Michigan, to make sure that our voting maps are never again drawn up by partisan legislators.
That’s the kind of grassroots fight that helped Wisconsin finally overcome Republican gerrymandering. One important aspect of the fair maps movement is the way it engaged citizens to feel like participants, not spectators, in democracy, and to find their common interests instead of focusing on the politics of division. This, not more politicians in safe seats who don’t have to listen to voters, is what we need right now.
The battle to beat back fascism does not turn on a handful of Democrats in protected districts. It turns on an organized uprising by the majority of people in the U.S. who are willing to join together despite their differences because they are sick and tired of having their democracy stolen from them, along with their health, safety, opportunity and hope. There’s no short cut to leading that fight.

The Rutgers Board of Governors on Monday approved the hiring of former LSU Chief Administrative Officer Kimberly Lewis for the same position at their university. The board also approved the hiring of Keena Arbuthnot as executive vice president for academic affairs. Arbuthnot is currently dean of LSU’s graduate school. 
Late last month, it was announced Tate would hire Keli Zinn, LSU’s executive deputy athletics director and chief operating officer as Rutgers’ new athletic director. 
Additionally, Louis Gremillion, LSU assistant vice president for government relations, will become Rutgers’ associate vice president for advancement and special assistant to the president. 
Before joining LSU in 2021, Lewis served as revenue secretary under former Gov. John Bel Edwards and had worked for two other Democratic governors. She was among a slew of top administrators who left LSU earlier this year. 
Lewis’ resignation letter indicated she was asked to leave her position. She was replaced on an interim basis by Tommy Smith. 
Arbuthnot was appointed dean of LSU’s Pinkie Gordon Lane Graduate School in 2024. LSU spokesman Todd Woodward said an interim dean will likely be chosen this week. 
Any interim administrators will not be considered for permanent positions until the LSU Board of Supervisors hires a replacement for Tate, who announced his departure for Rutgers in May and left Baton Rouge in June. 
The first meeting of LSU’s presidential search committee is scheduled for Aug. 19.

John Eastman says high court should hear matter “because it affects so much private property.”
The post Attorney who backed Trump on Jan. 6 now urging Supreme Court to hear corner-crossing case appeared first on WyoFile .","An attorney widely known for his involvement in President Donald Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election told WyoFile on Sunday why he will ask the U.S. Supreme Court to consider Fred Eshelman’s failed corner-crossing lawsuit.
John Eastman, an attorney well-practiced in Supreme Court cases and perhaps most famous for joining Rudy Giuliani on stage at the Jan. 6, 2021, “Save America” rally in Washington, D.C., explained his reasoning in an email. 
“The decision [by the 10th Circuit] effectively takes an easement on private property without compensation, in violation of the Takings Clause of the Constitution,” Eastman wrote WyoFile. “That, and because it affects so much private property, makes it an extremely important case for the Supreme Court to review.”
“We know there was fraud … “we know dead people voted.” John Eastman
The U.S. 10th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled earlier this year that four hunters did not trespass on Eshelman’s ranch after corner crossing to hunt on public land surrounded by Eshelman’s property. The wealthy North Carolina resident and owner of Carbon County’s Elk Mountain Ranch petitioned the Supreme Court to take up the case.
The hunters never set foot on Eshelman’s land, but did pass through the airspace above his property. The businessman sued the hunters in civil court to stop them from corner crossing.
In his petition for a writ of certiorari, Eshelman’s attorneys said the 10th Circuit ruling “steamrolls state law, takes easements, and revolutionizes property law affecting up to 150 million acres of private land.” Some 2.4 million acres of public land in Wyoming and 8.3 million acres nationwide would be “corner locked” and inaccessible if corner crossing is ruled illegal, according to the digital mapping company onX.
Conservative think tank
“[W]e plan to file an amicus curiae brief on behalf of the Claremont Institute Center for Constitutional Jurisprudence in support of the petition for writ of certiorari in the above-referenced matter,” Eastman wrote hunters’ attorney Ryan Semerad on Friday.  
Semerad provided a copy of the email after a request from WyoFile. He has said the Supreme Court does not need to take up the issue, and the 10th Circuit decision should stand.
Eshelman alleged three Missouri men trespassed in 2020 and four in 2021 to hunt near his roughly 22,000-acre ranch. The hunters stepped only on public land when hunting on federal, state and municipal property surrounded by Eshelman’s Elk Mountain Ranch.
The legal fight emerged from the checkerboard landscape of alternating public-private square-mile sections in southern Wyoming. The pattern is a relic of the railroad grant era of the 1800s and covers a swath of the state, 40 miles wide and about 200 miles long.

Hunters Bradly Cape, Phillip Yeomans, John Slowensky and Zachary Smith successfully fought Eshelman’s suit — and misdemeanor criminal charges — arguing they were protected by the 1885 Unlawful Inclosures Act. That law seeks to preserve public access to public land in the West.
The 10th Circuit decision that the hunters did not trespass applies to Wyoming, Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Utah and parts of Yellowstone National Park in Montana and Idaho. A ruling from the Supreme Court would institute legal uniformity across the country.
Briefs due Monday
Eastman and others who want to inform the Supreme Court whether it should hear Eshelman’s appeal are scheduled to file their opinions by Aug. 18. The Wyoming Stock Growers Association, the Wyoming Wool Growers Association, the Montana Stockgrowers Association and United Property Owners of Montana have indicated that they will join the fray.
The court on Friday granted the hunters an extension. They now have until  Sept. 17 to file their rebuttal.
Eastman’s conservative Claremont Institute is a think tank and advocacy group whose mission is “to restore the principles of the American Founding to their rightful, preeminent authority in our national life.” The group’s Center for Constitutional Jurisprudence, of which Eastman is the founding director, fights to uphold property rights, among other things.
Eastman is a member of the Bar of the Supreme Court, according to his email letterhead. He has represented more than 20 parties in front of the Supreme Court and represented amici curiae in more than 100 cases in that venue, according to his bio on the Claremont Institute website.
He was a clerk for Justice Clarence Thomas from 1996 to 1997, according to his bio.
Chapman University honored him for faculty excellence in scholarly and creative activity (2013), Franciscan University gave him the St. Thomas More Award (2010) and the J. Reuben Clark Society of Orange County gave him the J. Reuben Clark Award (2010), Eastman’s bio states.
2020 presidential election
Eastman is widely known for his role in advocating that then-Vice President Mike Pence had the authority to challenge states’ electoral votes that gave Joe Biden the victory in the 2020 election. At the Jan. 6, 2021 “Save America” rally on the Ellipse with Giuliani, he championed unproven allegations of voter fraud.
“We know there was fraud,” he said, “we know dead people voted.”
Shortly thereafter, rioters stormed the Capitol.
Eastman’s actions tangled him in a cobweb of legal trouble. The State Bar of California in 2023 charged him with 11 disciplinary counts alleging he planned, promoted and assisted Trump’s alleged strategy to overturn the 2020 election results. The California Bar had earlier warned it was investigating Eastman for “moral turpitude, dishonesty, and corruption.”
The Department of Justice and the State of Georgia indicted Eastman for his role in the 2020 election. Judge Tanya Chutkan dismissed the federal action, and the Georgia cases have been paused.
Eastman lists his California and Washington, D.C. licenses to practice law “temporarily inactive.” He has challenged the California charges and asked, unsuccessfully, that his license be reactivated.

In north Jackson’s Broadmoor neighborhood early Saturday morning, Buck and more than a dozen volunteers, mostly women, drilled away at fresh lumber, laid glue and lifted frames, following the blueprints for Buck’s future home.
Hopefully by the new year, she will be crossing the threshold of her new house built by Habitat for Humanity, something the 32-year-old has been waiting for since she first applied last fall. 
“ I’m getting nervous because I’m fixing to be on my own,” Buck said. “I’ve never been on my own.”
Buck isn’t new to the Habitat for Humanity model for homeownership. Her mother purchased her first home from Habitat for Humanity in 1999, and they’ve been living in Jackson’s Midtown neighborhood nearly her entire life. She said that by buying a home on her own, she’s taking a leap of independence. Buck has three children and wants to set an example. 
“ I want to learn how to be responsible so I can show my kids how to learn to be responsible and not to depend on somebody else,” she said.
Choosing to build in Jackson wasn’t a hard decision for her, she said. She wants to remain close to her mother and keep her children at the same schools.
“This is my home. I know the crime and stuff is bad, but this still is my home,” Buck said. “I love Jackson. I was born and raised here, and I don’t want to leave Jackson.”

Merrill McKewen, CEO of Habitat for Humanity Mississippi Capital Area, said that one of the missions of the nonprofit organization is to improve the living conditions for families and create successful homeowners. Habitat operates in the Hinds, Madison and Rankin counties, and since its formation nearly 40 years ago, it has built more than 660 homes. 
“Every morning at least 2,500 people wake up in a safe, decent, affordable house because of Habitat,” McKewen said. 
This work means transforming blighted properties and empty lots and offering 30-year, zero interest mortgages on them. McKewen stresses that Habitat for Humanity is an economic engine and doesn’t give homes away for free. Homeowners spend up to 80 working on their home and at least 125 “sweat equity” hours volunteering.
“It’s a passion to help my brothers and sisters in Christ get a chance to fulfill a dream. It’s something that they qualified for, worked for, and that they take the responsibility for. That’s why it’s a hand up, not a handout,” McKewen said.
She said it’s rare that a homeowner faces foreclosure and has to move, but it happens.
“My saddest day on the job is when I have to go stand in court in front of a judge to have them evicted, or sometimes they just abandon the house,” she said. “As tragic as that is, we then take the house, refresh it, bring it up to the standards of which we’re building now, and sell it to another qualified Habitat homeowner.”
In recent years, Habitat for Humanity has built 28 houses in the Broadmoor neighborhood where Buck will live, and McKewen said the work will continue. Placing Habitat builds in the community encourages neighbors to invest into their own homes. She hopes that impact can be felt for generations to come.
“I would like to buy 15 blighted properties or receive them if people bless us. If we could get 15 properties in the Broadmoor area, we could probably get close to the commitment I made pre-COVID, which was to impact 100 houses in the area,” McKewen said.
In building her first house, Buck said she hopes to impart a legacy for her children. She wants them to grow and thrive in the city that she loves, all while living in a safe neighborhood. She already imagines herself on her porch or watching her children play at the nearby park. 
“This will be my property in 30 years that I can call my home,” Buck said. “This is going to be mine, and I could leave it for my kids if they want it.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/09205806/IMG_5796.jpg,,,2025-08-11 10:57:36.988383

(Photo courtesy of Andrea Lonas/Jobs for the Future)A nonprofit plans to ask four states to participate in a $19.5 million initiative aimed at transforming how people transition from prison to the workforce.
The Fair Chance to Advance initiative, led by the national nonprofit Jobs for the Future, hopes to provide funding and support over four years to help states expand access to postsecondary education in prison and strengthen connections to employment after release.
The new initiative comes as state prison systems across the country continue to launch and expand education and work training programs. With the restoration and expansion of federal Pell Grant eligibility to incarcerated students in July 2023, the U.S. Department of Education estimated then that 760,000 people were newly eligible for federal financial aid — fueling interest in prison education efforts.
‘Transformative’: More college programs are slowly coming into prisons

But that momentum has not always been enough to connect formerly incarcerated people to well-paying jobs and opportunities that align with their qualifications — even for those who have earned advanced degrees — due to systemic barriers such as employer bias and restrictive occupational licensing requirements.
“What’s been the missing piece is making sure that those pathways are connected to quality jobs,” said Rebecca Villarreal, the senior director in the Center for Justice and Economic Advancement at Jobs for the Future.
Approximately 77 million U.S. adults, or about 1 in 3, have a criminal record, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, and can face persistent barriers to securing education, employment, housing and other basic resources after incarceration.
States can apply for the program; full proposals are due in October. Each of the four participating states chosen will represent a different U.S. Census region, according to Villarreal. Each state is expected to receive funding, technical assistance and access to a national peer learning network as part of a two-phase process beginning in February 2026.
A key goal of the initiative, Villarreal said, is to make education and workforce training acquired during incarceration more visible and transferable to employers. The program also aims to ensure that prison-based education and work training align with in-demand occupations and the broader labor market needs of each participating state.
As part of the initiative, participating states also will collect data to track post-incarceration education and employment outcomes.

States have led the way in regulating kratom, and now federal officials want to ban 7-OH, a powerful compound found in some kratom products. (Amanda Hernández/Stateline)For years, state lawmakers have taken the lead on regulating kratom — the controversial herbal supplement used for pain relief, anxiety and opioid withdrawal symptoms. Some states have banned it entirely. Others have passed laws requiring age limits, labeling and lab testing.
At least half of the states and the District of Columbia have enacted some form of regulation on kratom or its components — building a patchwork of policies around a product largely unaddressed by the federal government.
But that may soon change. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is pushing to ban 7-hydroxymitragynine, or 7-OH — a powerful compound found in small amounts in kratom and sometimes concentrated or synthesized in products sold online, at smoke shops or behind gas station counters.
Federal health officials announced last month that the compound poses serious public health risks and should be classified as a Schedule I controlled substance, alongside heroin and LSD.
The move marks a significant shift in how federal regulators are approaching kratom, which they attempted to ban in 2016. It also has sparked debate about how the change could impact the growing 7-OH industry and its consumers.
This year, at least seven states have considered bills to tighten kratom regulations, including proposals for bans, age restrictions and labeling requirements.
Kratom, which originates from the leaves of a tree native to Southeast Asia, can have a wide range of mental and bodily effects, according to federal officials, addiction medicine specialists and kratom researchers. Reports of fatal kratom overdoses have surfaced in recent years, though kratom is often taken in combination with other substances.
Kratom and 7-OH are distinct products with separate markets, but they are closely connected. 7-OH is a semi-synthetic compound derived from kratom and only emerged on the market in late 2023, while kratom itself has been available for decades.










This is a public health crisis waiting to happen.


– Christopher McCurdy, University of Florida professor of medicinal chemistry


Leading kratom researchers also say more research is needed to fully understand the long-term effects of using both substances.
“There’s much we don’t know, unfortunately, on all sides,” said Christopher R. McCurdy, a professor of medicinal chemistry at the University of Florida. McCurdy is a trained pharmacist and has studied kratom for more than 20 years.
Research suggests kratom may help with opioid withdrawal and doesn’t seem to cause severe withdrawal on its own. Smaller amounts seem to act as a stimulant, while larger doses may have sedative, opioidlike effects. Very little is known about the risks of long-term use in humans, according to McCurdy.
As for 7-OH, it shows potential for treating pain, but it hasn’t been studied in humans, and it may carry a high risk of addiction. Researchers don’t yet understand how much is safe to take or how often it should be used, McCurdy told Stateline.
While some leading kratom experts agree that kratom and 7-OH should be regulated, they caution that placing 7-OH under a strict Schedule I classification would make it much harder to study — and argue it should instead be classified as Schedule II like some other opioids.
A federal survey from 2023 estimated that about 1.6 million Americans age 12 and older used kratom in the year before the study. The American Kratom Association, a national industry lobbying group, estimated in 2021 that between 11 million and 16 million Americans safely consume kratom products each year.
Since gaining popularity in recent years, 7-OH has appeared in a growing number of products. Some researchers and addiction medicine specialists say many consumers, especially those new to kratom, sometimes don’t understand the difference between products.
“It’s a pure opioid that’s available without a prescription, so it’s akin to having morphine or oxycodone for sale at a smoke shop or a gas station,” McCurdy said. “This is a public health crisis waiting to happen.”
Federal crackdown targets 7-OH, not kratom
In late July, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommended that the federal Drug Enforcement Administration place 7-OH in Schedule I, citing a high potential for abuse. The classification would not apply to kratom leaves or powders with naturally occurring 7-OH.
“We’re not targeting the kratom leaf or ground-up kratom,” FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said at a news conference. “We are targeting a concentrated synthetic byproduct that is an opioid.”
Makary acknowledged that there isn’t enough research or data to fully understand how widespread 7-OH’s use or impact may be. Still, he said the Trump administration wants to be “aggressive and proactive” in addressing the issue before it grows into a larger public health problem.

While only small amounts of 7-OH occur naturally in the kratom plant, federal officials have raised concerns about U.S. products containing synthetic or concentrated forms of the compound because it’s more potent than morphine and primarily responsible for kratom’s opioidlike effects.
The FDA’s recommendation to schedule 7-OH will now go to the DEA, which oversees the final steps of the process — including issuing a formal proposal and opening a public comment period.
If finalized, the rule could affect both companies selling enhanced kratom products and consumers in states where those products are currently legal.
The DEA backed off scheduling kratom compounds in 2016 after widespread public opposition.
Kirsten Smith, an assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Johns Hopkins University who is studying kratom’s effects in humans, said she was surprised by the FDA’s push to schedule 7-OH.
“We don’t really have a public health signal of a lot of adverse events for either kratom or for 7-OH at this time,” she told Stateline. “I was, frankly, always surprised that kratom was pushed toward scheduling at an earlier time point. … I don’t know that we have data to support scheduling even now.”
Still, some advocacy groups, including the Holistic Alternative Recovery Trust, argue the push to schedule 7-OH is driven more by corporate interests than public health, suggesting the kratom industry is trying to sideline competition from 7-OH products.
“We think that this is just happening because of the legacy kratom manufacturers losing market share and wanting to gin up a crisis with this,” said Jeff Smith, the national policy director for the group, who said he has used 7-OH for sleep and pain management.
While his organization supports regulation and safe consumption, members worry the federal government’s move could drive people to riskier substances or push the market underground.
“It’s made a profound difference in my life,” Smith said. “We think it would be tragic to cut it off based on such a paucity of data when there’s so much potential for this product to help people.”
Public health concerns
Federal health officials say a key concern is the growing use of kratom and 7-OH products among teens and young adults.
Some officials and addiction medicine specialists have pointed out that these products often come in flavors and packaging designed to appeal to younger buyers, with few controls over where or how they’re sold. In some states without clear regulations, kratom and 7-OH products are available at gas stations or online, sometimes without any age verification.

“Whenever you go into a gas station and even though it’s behind the glass, it’s kind of eye level, and it has all of these bright colors — it has all of these things that really attract the visual of a kiddo,” said Socorro Green, a prevention specialist with Youth180, a nonprofit focused on youth substance use prevention in Dallas.
Green added that kratom and 7-OH products may be even more accessible to young people in rural communities, where gas stations and convenience stores are often among the few available retailers.
Some researchers and experts say that certain products may not clearly or accurately disclose their 7-OH content and are sometimes marketed or mistaken for traditional kratom.

Some cities, counties and states have responded by banning kratom or raising the minimum purchase age to 18 or 21. But in many areas, enforcement remains inconsistent, and some addiction specialists say clearer federal and state guidance is needed — especially as more people are using kratom and 7-OH to manage pain, anxiety or withdrawal symptoms on their own.
“There needs to be some kind of oversight, including some way of maybe helping to ensure that people know what they’re getting,” said Terrence Walton, the executive director and chief executive officer of NAADAC, the Association for Addiction Professionals.
State regulations
At least seven states have considered or enacted legislation this year related to kratom — ranging from age restrictions and labeling requirements to outright bans.
In New York, lawmakers passed two bills: one requiring warning labels and prohibiting kratom products from being labeled as “all natural,” and another raising the minimum purchase age to 21. Neither has been sent to the governor.
In Colorado, a new measure, which was signed into law in May, prohibits kratom from being sold in forms that resemble candy or appeal to children, increases labeling requirements, limits concentrations of 7-OH, and bans the manufacture and distribution of synthetic or semi-synthetic kratom.


In Mississippi, a new law that took effect in July raised the minimum purchase age for kratom to 21. It also bans synthetic kratom extracts and products with high concentrations of 7-OH. Lawmakers in Montana and Texas introduced similar legislation this year, but neither proposal advanced.
Louisiana is the latest state to enact a kratom ban, which took effect Aug. 1. Meanwhile, in July, Rhode Island became the first state to reverse its ban. The new law establishes a regulatory framework for the manufacturing, sale and distribution of kratom products, set to take effect in April 2026.
As of this year, Washington, D.C., and seven states — Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Louisiana, Rhode Island (until April 2026), Vermont and Wisconsin — have banned kratom. At least half of U.S. states now regulate kratom or its components in some way.

Aug. 8, 2025 | Photo by Kyle Davidson/Michigan AdvanceFollowing years of legal back and forth, attorneys for the Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy, and a host of environmental groups and agricultural industry representatives, met on Friday to discuss whether to move forward with tighter restrictions on industrial livestock farming. 
EGLE offered a new general permit for regulating concentrated animal feeding operations in 2020, updating provisions from its previous 2015 permit including regulations on how animal waste is applied as fertilizer.
While the department is required to issue new permits every five years, the  2020 permit never went into effect due to several challenges from agricultural industry groups. 
The Michigan Supreme Court determined in 2024 that EGLE had not violated administrative rulemaking procedures when issuing new requirements on the amount of phosphorus that can be applied to land and revising setback requirements for where these feeding operations can apply livestock waste. 
However, Administrative Law Judge Daniel Pulter stripped out several provisions earlier this year as part of the contested case hearing on the new permit.
  Zachary Larsen, an attorney representing several agricultural industry groups, opposed additional measures proposed by environmental interests to more tightly regulate how confined animal feeding operations apply their waste to agricultural fields.

In a discussion with EGLE Director Phil Roos, attorneys representing the agency’s Water Resources Division and representatives from the Environmental Law and Policy Center offered several suggestions on how the permit could be strengthened, advising Roos to restore provisions Pulter removed.
“EGLE is ready to move forward under a new permit, instead of being stuck for more than a decade under the insufficiently protective 2015 general permit,” Assistant Attorney General Elizabeth Morrisseau, who represented the Water Resources Division, said, adding that she hoped the agricultural groups felt the same way. 
A 2024 report from the Environmental Law and Policy Center notes waste from large scale animal feed operations often contain substances that can harm the environment, including detergents, antibiotics, PFAS and pathogens like E. coli.
When livestock waste is overapplied and misapplied, nutrients like phosphorus can runoff into water sources, leading to harmful algal blooms.
Nitrates, another nutrient found in feeding operation waste, also pose a risk to groundwater and have been linked to birth defects, miscarriage, blue baby syndrome and cancer.
“For the past five years because of these legal challenges, the untreated sewage generated by [concentrated animal feeding operations] has been subject to a failing 10 year old permit, and that delay has had consequences. In just the two years from 2022 to 2024, an additional 583 waters in Michigan have been deemed impaired due to E. coli, phosphorus or other nutrients.” Katie Garvey, senior attorney for the Environmental Law and Policy Center, said.

In order to avert these harms Morrisseau offered three recommendations: 

Banning wintertime land application of animal waste, save for the last two weeks of March 
Allow permit writers to craft additional conditions when issuing certificates of coverage to large scale animal farms operating and disposing waste in watersheds subject to total maximum daily load conditions, which determine how much pollution a lake or stream can absorb in order to comply with state water quality standards
Adding the following provisions stripped out by Pulter’s ruling. 

A definition of the term “operational control” over manure
Individual groundwater monitoring requirements
Individual land application reporting requirements



While the Environmental Law and Policy Center agreed with EGLE’s recommendations, the organization offered recommendations of their own, including:

A full ban on winter application and the sale, gift or transfer of animal feeding operation waste through March 31 and on frozen or snow-covered ground at any other time
Additional requirements on the sale, gift or transfer of animal feeding operation waste, to help EGLE can track where this waste is being applied
Requiring the use of the Michigan Phosphorus Risk Assessment when applying manure
Banning the application of waste from animal feeding operations on tile-drained fields, which drain into nearby surface waters
Requiring additional testing of discharge from tile drains
Revising waste storage capacity calculation guidelines

Zachary Larsen, representing the Michigan Farm Bureau and several other agricultural industry groups, argued many of the requests from EGLE and the Environmental Law and Policy Center fell outside of the department’s legal authority, and that the Roos should avoid modifying Pulter’s decision. 
He also raised due process concerns, pointing to a 2024 executive order from Gov. Gretchen Whitmer which eliminated the Environmental Permitting Review Committee giving EGLE’s director or their designee the authority to hear permit review appeals and make decisions on permit application review petitions. 
“For those five years, EGLE pursued this litigation both in court and in front of the administrative body, and doubtlessly did so with the knowledge and approval of the agency’s leadership. Now EGLE staff is asking the same leadership to overturn much of the independent [administrative law judge’s] decision,” Larsen said. 
During the public comment period several Michigan residents discussed their experiences living near concentrated animal feeding operations, sharing grievances ranging from foul smells in the area to the contamination of their well water. 
Sydney Howard, speaking on behalf of FLOW Water advocates, said communities with higher poverty rates were correlated with areas where confined animal feeding operations were more likely to spread their manure, particularly in central Michigan, calling it a case of “textbook environmental justice.”
At the conclusion of the more than four-hour long hearing, Roos moved the meeting into closed session to consult with his attorney. Upon resuming, he declined to make a final determination on the permit, promising to schedule another meeting date.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_4408-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-11 10:57:36.988383

Rosa DeLauro is having the spinal surgery while Congress is on recess and plans to keep up her schedule during physical therapy.,"U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-3rd District, is undergoing surgery Monday to treat spinal stenosis, according to her office.
Dr. Judith L. Gorelick, a board-certified neurosurgeon, will perform the surgery at Griffin Hospital in Derby. The doctor called the procedure “a common treatment for a common occurrence.”
DeLauro’s office said the congresswoman will go to physical therapy after the procedure to help with recovery. DeLauro, 82, will pick her work schedule back up during her treatment.
She is having the surgery while Congress is on a month-long recess through August. Her office said she will return to Washington, D.C., after Labor Day with the rest of Congress. 
The Mayo Clinic describes spinal stenosis as a condition where the spaces in the backbone are too small. It is a more common diagnosis in people who are over 50.
Some people have no symptoms, but others may feel pain, tingling, numbness or muscle weakness. For many people diagnosed with spinal stenosis, it mostly occurs in the lower back or neck.
“The most common cause of spinal stenosis is wear-and-tear damage in the spine related to arthritis,” according to the Mayo Clinic. “People who have serious spinal stenosis may need surgery.”
Surgery can create more space and ease some of the symptoms caused by spinal stenosis. But if someone has arthritis, surgery cannot cure it, so pain in the spine attributed to that may not go away.
When she returns to Washington, D.C., in September, DeLauro and other congressional appropriators will be working on a quick deadline to fund the federal government. Funding runs out on Sept. 30.
She is the ranking member of the House Appropriations Committee and will help negotiate spending bills, though lawmakers may need to approve a short-term funding bill if they are unable to pass year-long spending bills for the next fiscal year.
DeLauro is the longest-serving member of Connecticut’s congressional delegation. She was first elected in 1990.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023_0710_SR_WeickerService_551-scaled.jpeg,,,2025-08-11 10:57:36.988383

(Photo by Eric Lee/Getty Images)Violent crime in the United States fell 4.5% in 2024, according to a new FBI report, while property crime dropped 8.1% from the previous year.
The declines continue a trend seen since crime surged during the COVID-19 pandemic, when homicides jumped nearly 30% in 2020 — one of the largest one-year increases since the FBI began keeping records in 1930. By 2022, violent crime had fallen close to pre-pandemic levels.
Homicides, which the FBI classifies as murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, dropped nearly 15% in 2024. Reports of other violent offenses also decreased, including rape by 5.2%, robbery by 8.9% and aggravated assault by 3%.
Property crime also fell across all major categories, with motor vehicle theft down 18.6%, burglary down 8.6% and larceny-theft down 5.5%. Reported hate crimes decreased 1.5% from the previous year.
The 2024 report draws on submissions from 16,675 law enforcement agencies — 2.1% more than last year — representing more than 95% of the U.S. population. Every city agency serving a population of 1 million or more people provided a full year of data. Participation in the FBI’s crime data collection is voluntary, and the data is based on crimes reported to police.
About 75% of participating agencies submitted information through the FBI’s new, more detailed National Incident-Based Reporting System, or NIBRS, which covered 87% of the population.
The data release marks a shift from recent years when participation lagged following the FBI’s 2021 transition to the new system, which required many law enforcement agencies to invest in training and technology upgrades. In 2021, national reporting rates fell below 70% for the first time in two decades, forcing the FBI to estimate results for many jurisdictions.
The FBI’s crime trends report also includes new law enforcement safety data. Sixty-four officers were feloniously killed in the line of duty in 2024, 43 officers were accidentally killed and 85,730 officers were assaulted.
Although the FBI’s 2024 report is a year behind, it aligns with other crime trend reports. The Council on Criminal Justice, a nonpartisan think tank, recently found that homicides and other serious offenses, including gun assaults and carjackings, fell in the first half of 2025 across 42 major cities compared to the same period in 2024.

Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, on Tuesday, March 18, 2025. (Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s move to establish a state Department of Agriculture during the ongoing legislative special session appears to be turning into a fight over executive power, and it could be ultimately decided by the courts.
Last week, as the special session opened in Juneau, Dunleavy signed an executive order intended to establish the Alaska Department of Agriculture by moving parts of the Alaska Department of Natural Resources into a separate agency.
Alaska is one of only two states without a cabinet-level agriculture department, and Dunleavy has said he wants to create one in order to help the growth of farming in the state. Creating a cabinet-level agriculture department was the top priority of a state “food security” task force in 2022 intended to encourage farming here.
The governor’s order would take effect Jan. 1 and is almost identical to one Dunleavy issued this spring. 
Under the Alaska Constitution, lawmakers can stop an executive order if they vote to dismiss it within 60 days. Legislators did just that with the spring order, voting 32-28 in March to deny the governor’s original order. 
At the time, and since then, legislators have said that they prefer to enact a state department via law because it allows them to include their own ideas and comments of the public.
“The problem with an executive order is that we can’t amend an executive order,” said Senate President Gary Stevens, R-Kodiak, “and there’s some things that I think folks want to do.”
This month, when Dunleavy repeated the order, legislators refused to accept it. 
Stevens and Speaker of the House Bryce Edgmon, I-Dillingham, said in a letter to the governor that introducing an executive order during a special session is unconstitutional, and that repeating an already disallowed order is also unconstitutional.
“This falls in the category of so many things during Dunleavy’s tenure as governor, where he has tried to push the boundaries with the Legislature. And we’re at the point now where we’re tired of being pushed around,” Edgmon said by phone on Friday.
The governor responded to the legislators’ letter with a letter of his own last week, saying that he has a different legal interpretation and believes the Legislature’s view is wrong.
Jeff Turner, the governor’s communications director, said by email on Friday that the letter still stands as the governor’s view and nothing has changed since then.
“His sort of threat to go ahead anyway is a little disconcerting,” Stevens said. “The legislative process, though long … winds up with a better answer because the public will have a chance to testify in the committee hearings, and we’ll all have a chance to discuss it and try to figure out the best way going forward. Unfortunately, an executive order is really sort of a ham-handed way to organize a new department. I really hope the governor allows us to move ahead and do it on our own through the legislative process.”
Legislators could meet in joint session and again vote down the governor’s executive order, but doing so would be an implicit acknowledgement that the governor has the ability to issue a valid executive order during a special session.
“We’ve heard that from our legal folks,” Stevens said, “that establishing a precedent like that could be dangerous in the future. Any governor then could do something without the Legislature really being involved. … and so we’re really concerned about precedents.”
Those differing positions have created a standoff: Legislators are refusing to accept the order as valid, and the governor’s office has said that if legislators don’t vote it down, Dunleavy will take that as acceptance. He said he will go ahead with plans to create the department on Jan. 1.
If he does that, Stevens said that the issue is likely to go to the courts.
Edgmon said that lawmakers are prepared to stand their ground.
“The Legislature believes its decision to send the executive order back to the governor is based on firm ground, and we fully intend to defend our institution’s ability to do its work,” he said.

This story by John Lippman was first published in the Valley News on August 9.
CHELSEA — The grieving family of a Newbury, mother of four who was shot and killed by her father more than four years ago pleaded before a Vermont judge never to let her murderer live free in society again and to ensure the state places him in an appropriate institution.
“I’m not here asking for revenge. I’m asking for safety,” said Mason Rheaume, the eldest of Karina Rheaume’s four sons.
He was 18 years old when his mother was killed by a shotgun blast fired by her father, James Perry Jr., on the porch of Perry’s Newbury home in 2021. She had shown up at his door with a plate of cookies for a welfare check.
Karina Rheaume’s family has been reeling ever since the shooting and is now pressing Vermont officials to address the problem of inadequate state resources to handle people whose mental illness has led them to commit horrific crimes.
“Jim Perry must remain in a facility specifically designed for long-term psychiatric care — not a nursing home, not under the limited supervision,” Mason Rheaume said, stating that what his grandfather requires is “ongoing, lifelong oversight in a secure setting that protects him and those around him in the community.”
Mason Rheaume’s statement, along with others from his brother, their father and Karina’s sister were given in a packed courtroom in Chelsea before Superior Court Judge Daniel Richardson, after family friends and supporters contacted the county prosecutor’s office in recent weeks out of concern over Perry’s looming release from prison.
Perry, 74, was found not guilty by reason of insanity earlier this year in the shooting death of his 38-year-old daughter. A psychiatric evaluation concluded he had been “floridly psychotic with paranoid delusions and hallucinations” when he shot Karina at point-blank range with a 12-gauge shotgun on May 3, 2021, at his home on Deerfield Lane in Newbury.

Since the court’s insanity determination, which leaves Perry with no criminal record and with little agency oversight, the Orange County State’s Attorney’s Office and the state Mental Health Department have come under sharp criticism from Karina Rheaume’s family members and supporters who say the state does not do enough to protect victims and the public from the ongoing risk Perry presents to the community as well as himself.
When Emilie Perry, Karina Rheaume’s sister, learned that the options state officials were weighing for her father after his release from prison included his “uninhabitable” home in Newbury, a nursing home or a “hotel in Barre,” she called upon friends and supporters to write to the state attorney’s office to register their concern.
Within days, more than a hundred emails and letters were sent to Colin Seaman, the state attorney for Orange County.
“The court is well aware that this has become an item of great public interest,” Richardson acknowledged from the bench at the outset of the approximately 32-minute hearing, while also cautioning “misinformation” has also accompanied that concern.
Despite its reputation for progressive policies, critics have long contended that Vermont lacks adequate resources and facilities to handle people whose crimes are attributed to mental illness.
The lack of accommodations, for example, led to a Strafford man convicted of arson for burning down his cabin while suffering from delusions in 2023 spending 240 days in a Springfield prison. His attorney maintained his client needed treatment instead.
On Friday, supporters and family members of Karina Rheaume’s family filled every available spot on the visitors’ benches at the back of the second floor courtroom. A large-screen video monitor displayed phone icons of people watching remotely. Karina’s sons, dressed in suits and ties, and Karina’s sister Emilie, sat on the front bench, stifling tears when a family member went to the podium and addressed the judge.
“I urge you to consider the profound impact (Perry’s) actions have had on our family and the community,” Joshua Rheaume, Karina’s second oldest son, said. The unfathomable murder of his mother “point(s) to a deep-seated mental instability that requires long-term, intensive psychiatric care.”

Perry, shackled and wearing blue prison sweats, sat at the defense table next to his attorney, Mike Shane. With his hair cropped closely and beard trimmed and hooked up to a hearing aid, Perry appeared alert and compliant, a different visage from the gaunt, wide-eyed, straggly hair and thick, overgrown beard image in his booking photo after his arrest.
Perry’s criminal case ended with the insanity determination, Judge Richardson explained, and he is now in a “civil” phase meant to assess his mental health needs and treatment program. But those issues will be addressed at a future hearing, the judge said.
Family members said there can be no guarantee Perry will not relapse into psychosis.
“While his mental state may appear stable now, (Perry) is in a structured environment of incarceration,” Joshua Rheaume said. “What happens when he is released and faces the stresses and triggers of the outside world? The risk is too great. Our family, community and any potential future victims deserve the assurance of a more permanent solution.
Emilie Perry grasping a tissue and fighting back tears, recounted the disbelief of learning that it was possible her father could be essentially left on his own following the expiration of a 90-day “non-hospitalization order.”
“The shock of this email was so unbelievable that it didn’t seem like it could be real,” Emilie Perry said. “I wrote back saying that was insane and spent the following days calling the state’s attorney, the defense, the mental health department, and anyone I could think of to make sense of what was a horribly terrifying proposal by the courts.”
“To act like the court is working to protect (Perry’s) rights is not true if he’s not given placement in a safe (…) environment. It is cruel to set him up to be unable to take care of himself and put himself and others at risk,” she said.
Both Seaman, the Orange County state’s attorney, and Shane, Perry’s defense attorney, said state officials are working together at multiple agencies and levels to address the public’s concern.
Shane, before Friday’s hearing, said that the Department of Mental Health will extend that order of non-hospitalization “indefinitely” and “if there are issues” then the non-hospitalization order will convert to an “involuntary hospitalization order.”

“There is a really good plan coming together,” Shane said, noting that the Department of Mental Health, the State’s Attorney’s Office, the Judiciary’s Guardian ad Litem Program that advocates on behalf of children who are victims of crime “and our own experts” are “working collaboratively to find the best fit for (Perry’s) needs and the needs of the community. I think when the plan is presented everyone will feel better.”
After Friday’s hearing, on the green outside the courthouse in Chelsea, Joe Rheaume, the father of Karina’s children and her former husband, and Karen Tronsgard-Scott, executive director of the Vermont Network Against Domestic and Sexual Violence, both said there are “holes” in the way Vermont handles cases like Perry’s. Once it shifts to a civil matter victims have been excluded from the civil process phase of determining the offender’s fate.
“Victims should really have a seat at the table,” Tronsgard-Scott said. “They should be a part of every process in the courtroom.”
Joe Rheaume said the current system and civil phase needs to change.
“When you have a defendant who’s adjudicated not guilty by reason of insanity and the next step is to just release them into society, I mean, everybody can logically think there’s something wrong with that,” Joe Rheaume said.
“There needs to be some kind of ramp or step-down program where this offender gets put into something secure, something semi-secure, anything,” he said.
Friday’s hearing, during which his family got to go on record with their victim impact statements, only happened as the result of the family’s persistence, Joe Rheaume noted.
“We’ve had to advocate for this. We’ve been pushing,” he said.
When it was pointed out that what he seeks requires the Vermont State Legislature to take up the matter and make law where none currently exists, Joe Rheaume acknowledged the challenge.
“That’s where this is going. That’s where we’re headed,” he replied.

For years, state lawmakers have taken the lead on regulating kratom — the controversial herbal supplement used for pain relief, anxiety and opioid withdrawal symptoms. Some states have banned it entirely. Others have passed laws requiring age limits, labeling and lab testing.
At least half of the states and the District of Columbia have enacted some form of regulation on kratom or its components — building a patchwork of policies around a product largely unaddressed by the federal government. The sale and possession of kratom is legal in Pennsylvania.
But that may soon change. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is pushing to ban 7-hydroxymitragynine, or 7-OH — a powerful compound found in small amounts in kratom and sometimes concentrated or synthesized in products sold online, at smoke shops or behind gas station counters.
Federal health officials announced last month that the compound poses serious public health risks and should be classified as a Schedule I controlled substance, alongside heroin and LSD.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The move marks a significant shift in how federal regulators are approaching kratom, which they attempted to ban in 2016. It also has sparked debate about how the change could impact the growing 7-OH industry and its consumers.
This year, at least seven states have considered bills to tighten kratom regulations, including proposals for bans, age restrictions and labeling requirements.
Kratom, which originates from the leaves of a tree native to Southeast Asia, can have a wide range of mental and bodily effects, according to federal officials, addiction medicine specialists and kratom researchers. Reports of fatal kratom overdoses have surfaced in recent years, though kratom is often taken in combination with other substances.
Kratom and 7-OH are distinct products with separate markets, but they are closely connected. 7-OH is a semi-synthetic compound derived from kratom and only emerged on the market in late 2023, while kratom itself has been available for decades.










This is a public health crisis waiting to happen.


– Christopher R. McCurdy, professor of medicinal chemistry at the University of Florida


Leading kratom researchers also say more research is needed to fully understand the long-term effects of using both substances.
“There’s much we don’t know, unfortunately, on all sides,” said Christopher R. McCurdy, a professor of medicinal chemistry at the University of Florida. McCurdy is a trained pharmacist and has studied kratom for more than 20 years.
Research suggests kratom may help with opioid withdrawal and doesn’t seem to cause severe withdrawal on its own. Smaller amounts seem to act as a stimulant, while larger doses may have sedative, opioidlike effects. Very little is known about the risks of long-term use in humans, according to McCurdy.
As for 7-OH, it shows potential for treating pain, but it hasn’t been studied in humans, and it may carry a high risk of addiction. Researchers don’t yet understand how much is safe to take or how often it should be used, McCurdy told Stateline.
While some leading kratom experts agree that kratom and 7-OH should be regulated, they caution that placing 7-OH under a strict Schedule I classification would make it much harder to study — and argue it should instead be classified as Schedule II like some other opioids.
A federal survey from 2023 estimated that about 1.6 million Americans age 12 and older used kratom in the year before the study. The American Kratom Association, a national industry lobbying group, estimated in 2021 that between 11 million and 16 million Americans safely consume kratom products each year.
Since gaining popularity in recent years, 7-OH has appeared in a growing number of products. Some researchers and addiction medicine specialists say many consumers, especially those new to kratom, sometimes don’t understand the difference between products.
“It’s a pure opioid that’s available without a prescription, so it’s akin to having morphine or oxycodone for sale at a smoke shop or a gas station,” McCurdy said. “This is a public health crisis waiting to happen.”
Federal crackdown targets 7-OH, not kratom
In late July, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommended that the federal Drug Enforcement Administration place 7-OH in Schedule I, citing a high potential for abuse. The classification would not apply to kratom leaves or powders with naturally occurring 7-OH.
“We’re not targeting the kratom leaf or ground-up kratom,” FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said at a news conference. “We are targeting a concentrated synthetic byproduct that is an opioid.”
Makary acknowledged that there isn’t enough research or data to fully understand how widespread 7-OH’s use or impact may be. Still, he said the Trump administration wants to be “aggressive and proactive” in addressing the issue before it grows into a larger public health problem.
States stiffen penalties for fentanyl, despite public health concerns

While only small amounts of 7-OH occur naturally in the kratom plant, federal officials have raised concerns about U.S. products containing synthetic or concentrated forms of the compound because it’s more potent than morphine and primarily responsible for kratom’s opioidlike effects.
The FDA’s recommendation to schedule 7-OH will now go to the DEA, which oversees the final steps of the process — including issuing a formal proposal and opening a public comment period.
If finalized, the rule could affect both companies selling enhanced kratom products and consumers in states where those products are currently legal.
The DEA backed off scheduling kratom compounds in 2016 after widespread public opposition.
Kirsten Smith, an assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Johns Hopkins University who is studying kratom’s effects in humans, said she was surprised by the FDA’s push to schedule 7-OH.
“We don’t really have a public health signal of a lot of adverse events for either kratom or for 7-OH at this time,” she told Stateline. “I was, frankly, always surprised that kratom was pushed toward scheduling at an earlier time point. … I don’t know that we have data to support scheduling even now.”
Still, some advocacy groups, including the Holistic Alternative Recovery Trust, argue the push to schedule 7-OH is driven more by corporate interests than public health, suggesting the kratom industry is trying to sideline competition from 7-OH products.
“We think that this is just happening because of the legacy kratom manufacturers losing market share and wanting to gin up a crisis with this,” said Jeff Smith, the national policy director for the group, who said he has used 7-OH for sleep and pain management.
While his organization supports regulation and safe consumption, members worry the federal government’s move could drive people to riskier substances or push the market underground.
“It’s made a profound difference in my life,” Smith said. “We think it would be tragic to cut it off based on such a paucity of data when there’s so much potential for this product to help people.”
Public health concerns
Federal health officials say a key concern is the growing use of kratom and 7-OH products among teens and young adults.
Some officials and addiction medicine specialists have pointed out that these products often come in flavors and packaging designed to appeal to younger buyers, with few controls over where or how they’re sold. In some states without clear regulations, kratom and 7-OH products are available at gas stations or online, sometimes without any age verification.

“Whenever you go into a gas station and even though it’s behind the glass, it’s kind of eye level, and it has all of these bright colors — it has all of these things that really attract the visual of a kiddo,” said Socorro Green, a prevention specialist with Youth180, a nonprofit focused on youth substance use prevention in Dallas.
Green added that kratom and 7-OH products may be even more accessible to young people in rural communities, where gas stations and convenience stores are often among the few available retailers.
Some researchers and experts say that certain products may not clearly or accurately disclose their 7-OH content and are sometimes marketed or mistaken for traditional kratom.
As Kratom Use Surges, Some States Enact Bans

Some cities, counties and states have responded by banning kratom or raising the minimum purchase age to 18 or 21. But in many areas, enforcement remains inconsistent, and some addiction specialists say clearer federal and state guidance is needed — especially as more people are using kratom and 7-OH to manage pain, anxiety or withdrawal symptoms on their own.
“There needs to be some kind of oversight, including some way of maybe helping to ensure that people know what they’re getting,” said Terrence Walton, the executive director and chief executive officer of NAADAC, the Association for Addiction Professionals.
State regulations
At least seven states have considered or enacted legislation this year related to kratom — ranging from age restrictions and labeling requirements to outright bans.
In New York, lawmakers passed two bills: one requiring warning labels and prohibiting kratom products from being labeled as “all natural,” and another raising the minimum purchase age to 21. Neither has been sent to the governor.
In Colorado, a new measure, which was signed into law in May, prohibits kratom from being sold in forms that resemble candy or appeal to children, increases labeling requirements, limits concentrations of 7-OH, and bans the manufacture and distribution of synthetic or semi-synthetic kratom.

In Mississippi, a new law that took effect in July raised the minimum purchase age for kratom to 21. It also bans synthetic kratom extracts and products with high concentrations of 7-OH. Lawmakers in Montana and Texas introduced similar legislation this year, but neither proposal advanced.
Louisiana is the latest state to enact a kratom ban, which took effect Aug. 1. Meanwhile, in July, Rhode Island became the first state to reverse its ban. The new law establishes a regulatory framework for the manufacturing, sale and distribution of kratom products, set to take effect in April 2026.
As of this year, Washington, D.C., and seven states — Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Louisiana, Rhode Island (until April 2026), Vermont and Wisconsin — have banned kratom. At least half of U.S. states now regulate kratom or its components in some way.

(Anna Kaminski/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Two years after police staged a chilling raid on the Marion County Record, the newspaper’s owner-editor remains committed to the hard-hitting journalism that made him a target.
And he wants his ongoing lawsuit against the city and county to hurt.
Eric Meyer appeared on the Kansas Reflector podcast to talk about how things have changed since the Aug. 11, 2023, raid, when police stormed the newsroom under the false pretense that a reporter had committed identity theft by looking up a driving record in a public online database. They took computers and reporters’ personal cellphones, acting outside the scope of a search warrant that was issued in disregard for the U.S. Constitution and state and federal laws that protect journalists.


The raid spawned one state and five federal lawsuits, as well as a criminal charge against Gideon Cody, the former police chief who led the raid. The legal action continues to unfold as attorneys battle in federal court and a hearing in Cody’s case is scheduled for this fall.

Following is an edited and abbreviated Q&A from the podcast with Meyer.
How has your life changed in the past two years?
You don’t have long enough in your podcast to explain it all. It has changed massively. In addition to the practical side of it, that I’ve had a lot of places I’ve gone, a lot of speeches I’ve given, a lot of other things that have gone on, but just the work of it. You know, this was my retirement gig. I was going to come here and do this part-time for fun.
What could be more fun than this?
Well, it is fun. I at one point said that my mother, who died as a result of the stress of the raid, had an opportunity at 98 to go out meaning something in her life. But it’s nice as a retiree to be out here doing something, of still meaning it somehow or another, trying to keep trying — maybe as Don Quixote — to keep journalism alive. But we are trying our hardest to not bow to pressures and still get good journalism out there. And it really is a battle.
What are some of the revelations that have come out since we last checked in with you about this time a year ago?
Not as many as you’d think. We’re still literally blocked from discovery in our federal court lawsuits, which means we can’t go out and interrogate people that we think have information that would be relevant to the case. And part of this is being able to figure out the degree to which political people, elected officials and others, helped push this raid along.
This is important because there’s sort of been a narrative at times to pin this all on one rogue police chief, but I think the evidence clearly shows that one guy can’t do this in isolation. It was a coordinated effort.
Exactly. And I really object when that thought comes up, that this was just Gideon Cody who did this. And yeah, he did a lot of it himself. But there were people within law enforcement who helped him, people in elected positions, people in judicial court positions, who could have and should have stopped him, and they didn’t. Now, was it because they were not courageous? They didn’t want to make waves? Or was it that they agreed with him? Or was it that that they were just incompetent to what’s going on? I don’t know. That would be nice to find out.
Where do things stand in your case?
It’s abundantly clear from the rulings of the judge so far in the case on various motions of dismissal that we’ve probably won the case.
The most telling of these things was we had sued the city of Marion for failing to provide training to its police officers about the Privacy Protection Act, which says that you’re supposed to get subpoenas, not warrants, to raid newsrooms. And the judge threw that out, saying any fool who’d be a cop should know this automatically and without requiring specialized training.
And there are overtures now to try to settle — some official, some unofficial. I’m eager to get the thing done. But there are things other than financial damages at stake here. So there needs to be some admissions. There need to be things that are reported to licensing authorities for police officers other than Gideon Cody.
Are you committed to not settling, to seeing this out through trial?
The real reason we wanted to go to trial was we wanted a ruling on the record that acknowledges that this is something you just don’t do. And if they are willing to provide that as a stipulation, we might accept that. This has never been about money.
This is about making sure that people understand what they did was wrong, admit that publicly. Set it as an example. And somehow or other, it needs to hurt. One of our concerns is that they’ll want to settle up to the limit of their insurance coverage. Well, that really means you did nothing. I mean, it really probably needs to go a little beyond insurance. Now, we don’t want to bankrupt the city or county of Marion by any manner or means. But something that has a little pain to it.
Do you feel like you still have strong community support?
I think everybody, including me, would like to see this over. But they’re very supportive of us. They just don’t like the fact that it looks like we’re hickville. And to be honest, I think that’s a very unfair assumption. I think that Marion and Marion County are not hickville. Some things that went on in Marion and Marion County that probably go on in a lot of other counties have been exposed. We just don’t hear about them in other counties.
And to an extent, Marion County should take pride in the fact there here, we’ve had a situation where somebody tried to trample on rights, and it didn’t happen. We fixed it. We’re in the process of fixing it. So you can take pride in that. It’s not where cops were stupid and raided a newsroom. It’s where somebody tried something stupid and, you know what? They didn’t get away with it. I think that’s a point of pride, but it would be nice to be known for something else.
I think it’s worth pointing out that accountability journalism put you in the crosshairs of police for this raid. But this is the role that journalists need to embrace, right, in this current climate?
Oh, absolutely.
I’m sorry to tell this to a group of people out there: There are facts. And some things are facts. And your opinion of the fact doesn’t change whether it’s a fact or not. And you have to pay attention to the nuances. You have to pay attention to the little things.
You and your late mother were inducted in the Kansas Press Association Hall of Fame last year. I went to the induction ceremony, where you gave this speech, shortly after the election in November, and you gave a sort of rallying cry to journalists. You said: “Make democracy great again.” Are journalists rising to meet this moment?
Some are, when they still have money to do it. I mean, closing the Corporation for Public Broadcasting is going to silence a great number of people in public media. Corporations are going to take care of silencing a great number of people elsewhere.
We need to have people aggressively going out and finding out what’s wrong. We had a story this week: They applied a new coating of pavement to the main road that leads to Pilsen, which is the home of Emil Kapaun, the man who’s about to be sainted as a Korean War hero. And it didn’t stick, and the road is now basically untravellable. Did they tell us about it? No! We had to find out about it. And now it’s a game of finger-pointing.
Journalists have joined this Gen Z thing: “We don’t want to embarrass anybody. Oh, my goodness, somebody might take offense if we run this story.” And so they don’t want to do it, and their corporate bosses say, “Oh yeah, they might cancel their ads. Oh, we can’t do that.” So we make our news publications and news broadcasts and other things so dull that nobody wants to read them anymore or listen to them anymore.
I used to say this as a journalism professor — that’s why I came here in my retirement, was that I think there’s still a place in this world for regular, good old-fashioned journalism. And this is from somebody who taught online and stuff like that in school. I said, “We’ve wasted too much time worrying about that stuff, and not enough time worrying about the substance of what we’re reporting. And get out there and get interesting things that matter to people and tell us about them.”
So I said, “Well, I can’t solve it for the world, but maybe I can make a little demonstration project out here that we can try to do it. And of course, somebody says, “Yeah, and what happened to you: You get raided.” Yeah, that’s true. But the raiding gives us more attention.
I may be quixotic in some regards and Pollyannaish in another, but the raid drew attention to the fact that we’re actually trying to do good journalism. So there’s a positive outcome to the raid.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MCoRecord-E-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-08-11 09:56:39.645044

At left is Mitch Meyers, partner at BeLeaf Medical marijuana company (Rebecca Rivas/Missouri Independent).Missouri cannabis business owners who have had their license revoked for violating state rules could be prohibited from getting another license under proposed rules announced by state regulators last week. 
The Missouri Division of Cannabis Regulation released the draft of a massive overhaul of cannabis rules giving regulators more authority to address a range of issues, including predatory practices in the state’s social-equity cannabis licenses, product recalls involving hemp-derived THC and non-compliant owners obtaining other licenses.
“We have found over the years that there’s really not a lot of structure or authority in rule… for us to address individuals in ownership or potential ownership who have been found to be either violating regulations themselves or responsible for those who are violating rules,” Amy Moore, director of the division, told The Independent Friday. “We have found that that is a gap.”
Among the rule revisions, Moore said, is a requirement for businesses to have mechanisms in place to remove owners who are responsible for violating state regulations. 
Missouri cannabis regulators announce new rules to target ‘predatory’ contracts

The changes cover so much ground, Moore said, because the division hasn’t made any rule alterations since the recreational marijuana constitutional amendment passed in 2022.
“It’s the things that we’ve learned over time,” she said, “and found it needed improvement or needed to be fixed. Hopefully we’re not missing anything.” 
Aside from revisions, a brand new rule released Thursday would establish an unlimited number of research licenses to study cannabis in Missouri.
The public can submit the feedback on the division’s website until Aug. 21, and regulators will then review them and decide if they want to formally submit the rules to the Secretary of State’s Office. 
Moore said if her team decides to move forward, they would like to do it “quickly.”
“If I thought, ‘Okay, we’ve solved everybody’s concern’…we could have it done in a couple weeks,” she said, “but we want to be sure that we are open to all the feedback and that we really consider it all.”
 Delta Extraction case

Nearly a year after the state stripped Robertsville-based Delta Extraction of its license in November 2023, regulators approved one of the company’s co-owners — AJO LLC — to take over a cultivation and manufacturing facility in Waynesville in May 2024. It’s a far bigger operation than Delta Extraction, and it also involves several dispensaries as well.
Lisa Cox, spokeswoman for the division, told The Independent in May that the rules currently do not prohibit individuals who have had a license revoked from acquiring another license. 
Moore said Friday that the new rules would give the division “a much better standing” to deny an application for a license for an owner who’s been noncompliant previously. 
She hopes it gives licensees “fair warning” when choosing future business partners.
“That’s part of why these new rules are so important,” she said. “This rule gives them a big heads up that that’s not going to work out for them, and they shouldn’t make that investment and get themselves tied up with individuals who have had previous non compliance.”
Co-owners of Missouri company at center of marijuana recall got green light for another license

It also establishes an annual review of ownership for every license. 
In February, Delta lost its appeal to get its license back, with Missouri’s administrative hearing commission concluding it had a “corporate culture of lax compliance with regulatory requirements.”
The scathing 137-page ruling, issued by Commissioner Carole Iles, informed the revisions released Thursday, Moore said. 
Iles agreed with the division that the company’s practice of bringing in hemp-derived THC concentrate from other states and adding it to Missouri-grown marijuana products was a violation of state law. 
“What this is doing is clarifying what we believe has always been in our rules and I think the Delta Extraction order from AHC confirms that that is what our rules mean…” Moore said, “that all the THC and THCA and those types of compounds need to originate from cannabis grown in our licensed facilities.”
 Microbusiness ‘fronts’

The microbusiness program, which was written into the Missouri 2022 constitutional amendment that legalized marijuana, was designed for the licenses to end up in the hands of disadvantaged business owners. The eligibility criteria includes disabled veterans, those with lower incomes and people with non-violent marijuana offenses.
Since the program began in 2023, the division has struggled to prevent what some legal experts have called “fronts,” or arrangements where the profits and ownership weren’t going to people that regulators had certified were eligible. 
Of the 96 microbusiness licenses issued so far, regulators have revoked 34. 
For the last two years, The Independent has documented the pattern of well-connected groups and individuals flooding the microbusiness lottery by recruiting people to submit applications and then offering them contracts that limited their profit and control of the business. A majority of the revoked licenses followed this pattern.
These kinds of agreements violate the constitutional requirement that the license be “majority owned and operated” by eligible individuals, Moore explained at a division town hall meeting in February. 
“It is not sustainable to keep going through rounds of license issuance and then having to do rounds of revocations,” she said in February. “We’re never going to get this market fully built out.”
The division first released rule changes for microbusiness licenses in December. The draft released Thursday includes some of the feedback the division received this winter, Moore said, but retained the core elements.

The designated contact for a microbusiness applicant must still be an eligible individual contributing to the majority ownership of the microbusiness license. And any entity who was the designated contact for a license that was previously revoked for failure to comply with the ownership and operation requirements may not be allowed to be involved in any capacity in a future microbusiness application.  
In order to prevent numerous revocations, the division is proposing to adjust when its extensive application-review period occurs. 
“Those adjustments really clarify what we are actually accomplishing here, which is ensuring that these licenses are held by eligible individuals,” Moore said. “And I think everyone really should agree that that’s the goal. I think the language that they have now is better focused on doing that.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/IMG_3084-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-11 09:56:39.645044

Today marks the first day of a planned three-day trial to determine whether the U.S. military unlawfully carried out civilian law enforcement when it was deployed to Los Angeles under President Donald Trump.
As CalMatters’ Mikhail Zinshteyn explains, a California federal district court will take up the matter, which stems from a June lawsuit Gov. Gavin Newsom filed against Trump after the president federalized California’s National Guard in response to demonstrators protesting against immigration raids in L.A. 
Lawyers for the state argue that the military violated a federal law that limits the use of the military in civilian settings. They point out that if the military can accompany immigration enforcement agents in their raids, it sets a precedent that authorizes it to accompany other law enforcement agents while they perform their duties, such as federal food safety inspectors.
The Trump administration says what the military did in L.A. doesn’t count as law enforcement. And because the law limiting military engagement is also a criminal statute, it cannot be invoked by the state since this lawsuit is a civil case.

Speaking of Trump: 

Feds request lift on immigration raids ban: The Trump administration is seeking help from the U.S. Supreme Court by asking it to lift a temporary restraining order, issued by a district court in July, that blocks immigration enforcement agents from conducting raids without “reasonable suspicion” in L.A. and other California counties. In its emergency appeal filed last week, the federal government said that the order is a major barrier to enforcing federal immigration laws. Read more from CalMatters’ Wendy Fry and Sergio Olmos.


Redistricting battle: Newsom on Friday gathered with Democratic lawmakers from Texas in Sacramento to again promote his plan to redraw California’s congressional maps. To counteract Texas Republicans’ plans to redistrict its maps in a way that benefits the GOP in the 2026 midterm elections, Newsom is proposing to call a special election to allow California voters to approve or reject a new map that would strengthen the chances of Democrats flipping Republican-leaning districts. The state Legislature is expected to take up the issue when it reconvenes from summer break on Aug. 18. Read more from CalMatters’ Alexei Koseff.

CalMatters’ Alexei brings you up to speed on the 2026 gubernatorial election:

Atkins’ conflicts of interest?: Former state Senate leader and current gubernatorial candidate Toni Atkins is married to the owner of a consulting firm, LeSar Development Consultants. Nearly half of the firm’s major clients last year employed lobbyists to influence government policy, and a state agency has hired the firm through 2028 to help California develop properties for affordable housing. Under California’s conflict of interest rules, however, these contracts can be seen as problematic: Atkins has equal ownership of her spouse’s assets through marriage, meaning that she earns hundreds of thousands of dollars annually from entities that could soon be vying for her sway if she is elected governor next year.

Trump’s chilling effect on international students

Some international students attending college in California are living in fear and censoring themselves as the threat of deportation looms under the Trump administration, writes Emewodesh Eshete of CalMatters’ College Journalism Network.
As part of his effort to cut back on immigration and combat alleged antisemitism, Trump issued an executive order in January that resulted in hundreds of international students losing their student status. Though many had their statuses reinstated in April after challenging the order in court, some international students in California are afraid that it will happen again. 
Some told Emewodesh that they have changed their involvement in campus activities, revised the topics they include in their research projects and scrubbed their social media presence.
Campus institutions are also responding to the chilling effect: The editor-in-chief of UC Davis’ student newspaper, for instance, said the outlet is more open to removing articles for the sake of protecting the status of international students.

The Delaware Department of Labor is launching a new initiative aimed at strengthening employment opportunities and protections for the state’s youngest workers.
The “Delaware Youth Workforce Connect Call,” a monthly virtual series organized by the Department’s Division of Industrial Affairs, will debut on Thursday, August 21.
The series is designed to connect community organizations, educators, employers, and state agencies to share resources, provide updates, and support youth employment across Delaware.

The initiative will focus on workers between the ages of 14 and 17, with the goal of educating both employers and young employees about workplace rights, safety, and job readiness.
“Our mission is to ensure Delaware employers understand their responsibilities while safeguarding the rights of workers — especially our youngest members of our workforce,” said Secretary of the Delaware Department of Labor LaKresha Moultrie. “The Delaware Youth Workforce Connect Call creates a space for collaboration, resource sharing, and compliance education that benefits both youth workers and employers.”
The first session will take place via Microsoft Teams from 11 a.m. to 12 p.m. and will feature a presentation on child labor laws, legislative updates affecting youth employment, and a preview of upcoming events aimed at preparing young people for the workforce.
In addition to presentations from labor officials, the sessions will offer a platform for participants to exchange tools, best practices, and ideas to promote safe and productive work environments for teens.

Atkins and her spouse, Jennifer LeSar, earn hundreds of thousands of dollars annually from clients that also lobby state government.","In summary
If elected governor, Toni Atkins faces potential conflicts of interest with her spouse’s consulting firms. Atkins and her spouse, Jennifer LeSar, earn hundreds of thousands of dollars annually from clients that also lobby state government.


If former state Senate leader Toni Atkins is elected governor next year, she would oversee a state contract that puts money in her own pocket.
Following a directive from Gov. Gavin Newsom to develop state-owned properties for affordable housing, the California Department of General Services in 2020 hired a consulting firm to help prioritize sites, conduct market research and evaluate applications from contractors.
That firm, LeSar Development Consultants, is owned by Atkins’ spouse, Jennifer LeSar. And because of California’s community property law that gives couples equal ownership of assets in their marriage, the $1 million contract — which was reupped in February through 2028 — has been worth tens of thousands of dollars to Atkins, according to financial disclosures.
It’s just one of the potential conflicts of interest with her spouse’s business dealings that Atkins faces as she seeks the most powerful office in California. Nearly half of the major clients last year at LeSar’s companies employed lobbyists to influence government policy.
Disclosure forms filed by Atkins and LeSar list 51 different entities, including the Department of General Services, from which they received more than $10,000 in income last year through LeSar Development Consultants, LeSar Support Services, LeSar Holdings, Inc. or Global Policy Leadership Academy — all firms for which LeSar serves as president or CEO.
A CalMatters analysis found that 24 of those clients are registered lobbyist employers. They include the counties of Los Angeles, San Diego and Orange, the cities of San Jose, Oakland, and Palm Springs, the insurance provider Elevance Health, the Bay Area homelessness advocacy group All Home and the homebuilder Brookfield Residential.
That means Atkins earns hundreds of thousands of dollars annually from entities that could soon be asking for her signature or veto on priority legislation, requesting funding in her state budget proposals or applying for contracts with her administration.
“People who have business before the state could be using the potential governor’s spouse as an advocate, essentially,” said Jessica Levinson, a professor at Loyola Law School and former president of the Los Angeles Ethics Commission.
No plan for Atkins on managing conflict
Atkins declined an interview request to discuss how she would handle conflicts of interest as governor. She did not say she would take any specific steps to insulate herself from LeSar’s business dealings or make any changes to their current arrangement.
“Toni is proud of her spouse Jen’s decades of work to expand access to affordable housing in California,” spokesperson Danni Wang said in a statement. “Throughout her leadership in both the Assembly and the Senate, Toni has maintained high ethical standards, prioritizing transparency and avoiding any conflicts of interest. If elected governor, she will continue to uphold those same principles and ensure that every decision is made in the best interest of Californians.”
California’s conflict of interest rules disqualify public officials from participating in governmental decisions that would foreseeably have an impact on their personal finances, though there is an exception if the potential effect does not benefit the official any more than it would the general public. 
Atkins is not the first politician with a family member whose work creates a potential conflict of interest with their elected office. Nor is she the only 2026 gubernatorial candidate whose income could complicate their tenure.
Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis told CalMatters in April that she would place her extensive property investments — which include downtown Sacramento office buildings that rent to at least three state agencies and dozens of organizations with business before state government  — in a blind trust if she won next November. She dropped out of the race on Friday.
But the direct financial benefit Atkins receives from LeSar’s income and the expansive portfolio of a governor, encompassing the entirety of California government, make this a particularly thorny case, Levinson said.
Organizations could theoretically hire LeSar to get closer to Atkins, while Atkins, as governor, could direct more state business to LeSar’s companies — though Levinson stressed that the potential for a conflict of interest does not necessarily indicate Atkins has done anything illegal or unethical.
“None of this means that she’s corrupt or she would make corrupt decisions,” Levinson said.
The relationship has long raised eyebrows
Questions about potential conflicts of interest with her spouse’s work have dogged Atkins throughout her rise in California politics. She married LeSar in 2008, when Atkins was a member of the San Diego City Council, and subsequently served 14 years in the Legislature, where she became the first person in more than a century to lead both the Senate and the Assembly.
As a lawmaker, Atkins received some criticism for introducing bills that would have raised taxes and fees to fund affordable housing development, her spouse’s line of work, so she sought permission from an attorney for the Legislature. After she became the Senate president pro tem in 2018, the Los Angeles Times reported that the clientele at LeSar’s firms had nearly quadrupled in five years. Last year, a campaign watchdog alleged that Atkins illegally used campaign funds for a $22,500 study trip to Austria organized by Global Policy Leadership Academy.
Atkins has always denied any wrongdoing.

LeSar’s business portfolio has grown to include four companies, which employ nearly three dozen people. The largest, LeSar Development Consultants, is a management consulting firm that provides strategic advising on affordable housing and homelessness projects. LeSar Support Services manages longer-term housing, public health and disaster recovery programs. Global Policy Leadership Academy offers training courses and study trips focused on urban development. All receive operational support from LeSar Holdings, Inc.
Though not among the most elite tier of affordable housing consultants in the state, LeSar carries considerable influence in the industry, particularly as she has carved out a unique lane with auxiliary services like her training academy, said Ben Metcalf, managing director of UC Berkeley’s Terner Center for Housing Innovation.
“There are some obvious synergies and benefits from her involvement in both of those organizations,” said Metcalf, who has attended a Global Policy Leadership Academy study trip.
On a statement of economic interests that LeSar filed last year with San Diego County for her consulting work, she reported the fair market value of LeSar Development Consultants at more than $1 million and for each of her other three companies at between $100,001 and $1 million. State financial disclosures only require filers to provide broad ranges.
Atkins reported receiving more than $100,000 in gross income from each of the four companies last year. That means, under California’s community property law, that LeSar earned at least double that amount — more than $800,000 — across her businesses.
The total income Atkins received is unknown. But nearly 40 of LeSar’s clients paid her enough last year that it triggered disclosure requirements for Atkins as well, because she earned more than $10,000 from each of them. That included the Department of General Services and 18 lobbyist employers.
“There are potential conflicts of interest with respect to any state agency consulting contracts,”  Thomas Hiltachk, a political and election lawyer whose firm helped set up a blind trust for Arnold Schwarzenegger when he became governor in 2003, said in an email. “Such conflicts could also appear with any private consulting clients if such clients have matters or legislation under the Governor’s authority.”
Few solutions for avoiding conflicts
The Department of General Services hired LeSar Development Consultants for its affordable housing project in November 2020, on a three-year contract worth nearly $1.1 million, according to a copy provided to CalMatters. LeSar was paid $301.41 per hour, including labor, fringe benefits, overhead and profit.
Shortly before it expired, the contract was extended for another year for an additional $364,000. Then in February, the department signed a new three-year contract, for just over $1 million, which will keep LeSar Development Consultants advising on proposals to build housing on state-owned properties through 2028. LeSar’s rate has increased to $350 per hour. 
“DGS is using the consultant to help as needed, through project initiation, preparation for and evaluation of proposals submitted by developers, provision of advice for complex policy, technical and procedural matters concerning affordable housing development, and ground lease and financial closings,” Fallon Okwuosa, a department spokesperson, wrote in an email.
CalMatters obtained several other public contracts that LeSar Development Consultants signed with cities and counties listed in Atkins’ statement of economic interest last year. They include a $964,800, one-year contract to produce a housing strategy for San Diego County; a $161,230, one-year contract to update Ventura County’s homelessness strategy; a $120,000, one-year extension of a contract to provide loan underwriting services for San Jose; a $100,000, one-and-a-half-year contract to advise San Jose on financing affordable housing projects, with renewal options through 2030; and a one-year extension of an ongoing $259,600 contract with Monterey County to update its exclusionary housing ordinance.
These local governments all employ lobbyists to weigh in on state budget funding requests and legislation.
Levinson and Hiltachk agreed that there are no easy solutions for Atkins to address the potential conflicts of interest if she is elected governor. Unlike with assets, such as property or investments, Atkins cannot put her spouse’s work in a blind trust.
And it would be complicated, Levinson said, for Atkins to recuse herself from every policy decision that affects LeSar’s clients.
“There’s just too many things that the governor does and too many ripple effects from a governor’s decisions,” Levinson said.
Because even the appearance of conflict of interest could undermine the public’s confidence in Atkins as governor, she added, LeSar might ultimately be forced to narrow the scope of her work or step back from her firms altogether.
“You’re punishing people who might never engage in nefarious behavior,” Levinson said. “But there’s a reason for that.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/051214-Toni-Atkins-2014-AP-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-11 08:57:43.423165

Gavin Newsom alleges the Trump administration broke a 19th Century law called the Posse Comitatus Act when it deployed military units to Los Angeles in June.,"In summary
Gov. Gavin Newsom alleges the Trump administration broke a 19th Century law called the Posse Comitatus Act when it deployed military units to Los Angeles in June.


Did the U.S. military illegally engage in civilian law enforcement when they were deployed to Los Angeles in June under the orders of President Donald Trump and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth?
California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta say yes. Trump’s Department of Justice says no. The three-day trial to answer this question is scheduled to commence today at 10 a.m. in a California federal district court, with implications for the country as Trump continues to signal a desire to deploy troops to patrol domestic city streets.The president has appointed himself chair of a task force on the 2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles, telling reporters that “we’ll do anything necessary to keep the Olympics safe, including using our National Guard or military, OK?”
Relatedly, the Department of Defense issued a new activation order to deploy troops in California for another 90 days on Aug. 5, California lawyers told the court in a filing. That came two weeks after the Marines deployed to Los Angeles left and a week after the Trump administration demobilized most of the National Guard.California’s lawyers assert evidence in their briefs, often redacted because of a court order, that the military took part in law enforcement in violation of 19th Century law called the Posse Comitatus Act. They want a judge to order the Trump administration to permanently halt those actions. The Trump Department of Justice counters that those engagements don’t count as law enforcement, but rather fall under the category of supporting immigration law enforcement agents or protecting federal buildings.Trump has not invoked the Insurrection Act, a law that would allow the military to engage in law enforcement activity.
How did we get here?
This trial is an extension of the June lawsuit that Newsom filed against Trump after the president took over California’s National Guard. Trump did that in response to protests that broke out in the Los Angeles area after immigration law enforcement agents began workforce raids to apprehend individuals allegedly in the U.S. without proper authorization.Ultimately, about 4,000 troops from the California National Guard and 700 U.S. Marines were deployed to Los Angeles.That month marked a new nadir in the relations between Newsom and Trump. The governor likened the president to failed dictators. Trump endorsed the idea of arresting Newsom.Charles Breyer, the judge in Monday’s case and oversaw the June hearings, initially sided with Newsom, ordering that Trump return the National Guard to the governor. A three-judge panel on the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals blocked that move. They found that the Trump administration legitimately called up troops to protect federal buildings and federal employees from some protesters who tossed chunks of concrete and used trash dumpsters as battering rams. California lawyers said the troops’ presence inflamed the protests.The June protests lasted about a week and were largely isolated to a handful of city blocks in the downtown area; Los Angeles is roughly 500 square miles.Breyer then allowed California’s lawyers to depose Trump officials and gather documents to argue California’s case that the Trump administration was violating the law barring the military from acting as a police force. Trump’s Department of Justice lawyers tried to cancel the trial but failed.
What is California’s latest allegation? 
That Los Angeles residents were “subjected to a form of military occupation” as federal troops worked alongside federal immigration agents, “often indistinguishable from each other.”The lawyers say that “never before, in the history of the Nation, has the federal government utilized the military for domestic law enforcement in this manner.”The Trump administration’s “insistence that perimeters, blockades, and other security functions are permissible makes clear they will continue to engage in these activities,” California lawyers with the state attorney general’s office wrote to Breyer.
The lawyers argued that if military forces can accompany U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in their raids and arrests, as had been unfolding in Los Angeles, “there would be no logical basis to preclude members of the Armed Forces from accompanying other law enforcement agents when performing their duties,” the California lawyers wrote. Military personnel could accompany federal food safety inspectors, medical fraud investigators or accompany federal voting rights officials to “monitor” election polling places, they wrote.
What are California’s examples of the military acting as police?
Attorneys representing the state pointed to several instances in which they allege troops went too far and violated the 1878 Posse Comitatus Act, which limits the use of the military in civilian settings:

California attorneys deposed an Immigration and Customs Enforcement field director who said National Guard soldiers accompanied immigration officers on as many as 75% of their missions.
Troops accompanied a federal agency during a “law enforcement operation” at a cannabis facility in Riverside County and formed a security perimeter that prevented people from leaving the site. 
Troops allegedly formed security perimeters on July 7 during a demonstration at MacArthur Park in Los Angeles during raids at cannabis farms in Ventura County.
In two incidents, military service members detained civilians, the California lawyers wrote. One took place in Carpinteria in Santa Barbara County, where National Guard troops allegedly “apprehended” a protester. In the other, a Marine on June 13 allegedly detained someone at the Wilshire Federal Building in Los Angeles.
California attorneys collected testimony from the deputy chief of staff of the military unit in Los Angeles who said the National Guard is subject to Posse Comitatus and cannot engage in civilian law enforcement. 
The attorneys point to military-issued guidance that “directly providing ‘security functions’ for civilian law enforcement agents is a violation of the Posse Comitatus Act,” per their summary. But, the lawyers note, the military unit in L.A. was ordered to “actively provide security during civil law enforcement operations on a near-continuous basis since the deployment began,” the California lawyers wrote. 

How does the federal government respond?
The federal government says California is wrong for four reasons. Some are disputes over technical court procedure and some disputing the facts California’s legal team is presenting.

Federal lawyers wrote that Posse Comitatus is a criminal statute, which cannot be used in a civil case, and the lawsuit is civil, not criminal. 
They dispute that the president or the Department of Defense exceeded its authority in ordering the troops to assist federal immigration law enforcement in apprehensions. “As Supreme Court precedent makes clear, the (Posse Comitatus Act) does not prohibit the President from using troops to protect federal personnel and property,” the Trump administration lawyers wrote.
The federal lawyers also say California has no standing to sue. (California’s attorneys dispute this.)
Fourth, the lawyers say that the National Guard can act as a police force because the law Trump cited to federalize them permits the National Guard to “execute the laws of the United States” if the president is unable to do that with “regular forces,” which at minimum means enforcing “federal immigration laws as well as laws forbidding interference with federal functions or assaults on federal officers and property,” the federal lawyers wrote.

The lawyers also dispute that the military’s role counts as law enforcement. California’s lawyers say the Marines “briefly detained” a protester. But the federal lawyers wrote that action “was in protection of federal property (the individual had attempted to enter a restricted area on federal property multiple times) and the Marines turned that individual over to the LAPD minutes later.”And providing a perimeter for federal immigration law enforcement also doesn’t violate Posse Comitatus, because, as a previous federal court found, “Posse Comitatus Act does not apply to federal troops playing ‘a passive role in civilian enforcement activities,’” the federal lawyers wrote.
What is likely to happen after this trial?
How Breyer will rule is impossible to forecast. He sided with California already only to have a three-judge panel in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals block his orders.Nor is the military the main force acting on the Trump administration’s interpretation of immigration law. The Department of Homeland Security has that role through its various agencies, including Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Border Patrol.
Those agencies were temporarily blocked by a lower district court judge from making apprehensions in Southern California based on race, ethnicity, language, and location or employment. The move sought to block “roving” immigration stops in California’s most populous region. 
A panel on the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that block. Last week the Trump administration appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States to lift the lower court’s restraining order.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/060825-Natl-Guard-MDC-DTLA-TS-03.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-11 08:57:43.423165

Sean Geary
Sean Geary is a former unhoused man who lives in his hometown of Pacifica. In 2021, he led a class-action lawsuit against Pacifica over a local ordinance that banned people in RVs from parking on city streets.


As the cruelty of the second Trump administration continues to come to bear, the recent executive order directing states to states to criminalize unhoused people and institutionalize those with mental health disabilities creates an interesting dilemma for Sacramento politicians.
Over the past few months, legislators have been pushing Assembly Bill 630, legislation that would facilitate the towing, dismantling and essentially the destruction of many RVs statewide under the guise of health and safety. If passed, the state would allow cities to destroy the last lifelines for Californians already pushed out of their homes by skyrocketing rents — and force them into the harsh, punitive systems now championed by the White House. 
Lawmakers should choose compassion and reject AB 630.
This issue is deeply personal for me. In March of 2020, I was working two well-paying jobs in downtown San Francisco yet could only afford to rent an RV. When COVID hit, my medications were cut off. It took nearly three years to have them reinstated. Without medication or steady income for rent, I lost the RV. My dog Rex and I then endured 15 traumatizing months in a shelter, where daily harassment by staff made life unbearable. 
Living there was far worse than being in an RV. After speaking out against the harassment, I was kicked out with one hour’s notice, two hours before sunset, with no chance to collect my belongings. We slept on the ground that night in 40-degree weather. 
After two more months in a tent, with the help of social service providers, I finally secured disability benefits and found an apartment.
Currently, cities and counties can destroy “inoperable” or “abandoned” vehicles valued at $500 or less after towing and storing them for 30 days. This policy already puts many peoples’ homes at risk because many cities declare vehicles inoperable simply if their engine won’t start, or deem them abandoned even when they’re inhabited. AB 630 raises that threshold to $4,000 for RVs, dramatically increasing the number of RVs subject to summary towing, storage and destruction.
As the bill’s author, Assemblymember Mark Gonzalez, acknowledges, this will affect most of the tens of thousands of RVs that are used as last-resort shelter. And yet, the bill does nothing to address houselessness itself — all it would do is strip away protections.

Proponents of this bill frame RVs as threats to health and safety, but for many Californians, RVs are their only remaining refuge. Removing these mobile homes directly threatens their personal health and safety. 
Genuine public safety concerns should be addressed without destroying last-resort housing of tens of thousands of Californians. Removing and dismantling someone’s RV takes away their shelter from wind, rain and the dangers of the street, as well as their ability to store water and cook food. It erodes their agency and autonomy. 
Even after these actions, the same number of police officers will be tasked with moving people along — people now more desperate, having lost any semblance of home or privacy.Living one’s private life in public view is highly distressing to begin with. Given the pressures of ticketing and towing from law enforcement, the situation becomes nearly unbearable. For people with homes, basic needs — getting clean, warm, seeking solitude, accessing water, using a restroom, eating a meal, or disposing of garbage — take just moments. For the unsheltered, these tasks can each consume the whole day.
Those that would suffer the negative effects from passage of this bill are our fellow community members struggling the most. There are none more affected by public safety issues than those living them without respite.
It’s far easier to elevate individuals when we don’t begin by knocking them down. California’s leaders should reject this inhumane bill and focus on positive, effective remedies to our housing crisis that leverage peoples’ potential instead.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/073125-San-Francisco-RV-Ban-GV-AP-01-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-11 08:57:43.423165

Google, Microsoft, Adobe and IBM will offer AI-related tools to California’s schools and universities in an effort to prepare the state’s students for a changing economy.


As artificial intelligence replaces entry-level jobs, California’s universities and community colleges are offering a glimmer of hope for students: free AI training that will teach them to master the new technology. 
“You’re seeing in certain coding spaces significant declines in hiring for obvious reasons,” Gov. Gavin Newsom said Thursday during a press conference from the seventh floor of Google’s San Francisco office. 
Flanked by leadership from California’s higher education systems, he called attention to the recent layoffs at Microsoft, at Google’s parent company, Alphabet, and at Salesforce Tower, just a few blocks away, home to the tech company that is still the city’s largest private employer.
Now, some of those companies — including Google and Microsoft — will offer a suite of AI resources for free to California schools and universities. In return, the companies could gain access to millions of new users.
The state’s community colleges and its California State University campuses are “the backbone of our workforce and economic development,” Newsom said, just before education leaders and tech executives signed agreements on AI.
The new deals are the latest developments in a frenzy that began in November 2022, when OpenAI publicly released the free artificial intelligence tool ChatGPT, forcing schools to adapt.
The Los Angeles Unified School District implemented an AI chatbot last year, only to cancel it three months later without disclosing why. San Diego Unified teachers started using AI software that suggested what grades to give students, CalMatters reported. Some of the district’s board members were unaware that the district had purchased the software. 
Last month, the company that oversees Canvas, a learning management system popular in California schools and universities, said it would add “interactive conversations in a ChatGPT-like environment” into its software. 
To combat potential AI-related cheating, many K-12 and college districts are using a new feature from the software company Turnitin to detect plagiarism, but a CalMatters investigation found that the software accused students who did real work instead.
Mixed signals?
These deals are sending mixed signals, said Stephanie Goldman, the president of the Faculty Association of California Community Colleges. “Districts were already spending lots of money on AI detection software. What do you do when it’s built into the software they’re using?”
Don Daves-Rougeaux, a senior adviser for the community college system, acknowledged the potential contradiction but said it’s part of a broader effort to keep up with the rapid pace of changes in AI. He said the community college system will frequently reevaluate the use of Turnitin along with all other AI tools. 
California’s community college system is responsible for the bulk of job training in the state, though it receives the least funding from the state per student. 
“Oftentimes when we are having these conversations, we are looked at as a smaller system,” said Daves-Rougeaux. The state’s 116 community colleges collectively educate roughly 2.1 million students.
In the deals announced Thursday, the community college system will partner with Google, Microsoft, Adobe and IBM to roll out additional AI training for teachers. Daves-Rougeaux said the system has also signed deals that will allow students to use exclusive versions of Google’s counterpart to ChatGPT, Gemini, and Google’s AI research tool, Notebook LLM. Daves-Rougeaux said these tools will save community colleges “hundreds of millions of dollars,” though he could not provide an exact figure. 
“It’s a tough situation for faculty,” said Goldman. “AI is super important but it has come up time and time again: How do you use AI in the classroom while still ensuring that students, who are still developing critical thinking skills, aren’t just using it as a crutch?”
One concern is that faculty could lose control over how AI is used in their classrooms, she added.
The K-12 system and Cal State University system are forming their own tech deals. Amy Bentley-Smith, a spokesperson for the Cal State system, said it is working on its own AI programs with Google, Microsoft, Adobe and IBM as well as Amazon Web Services, Intel, LinkedIn, Open AI and others. 
Angela Musallam, a spokesperson for the state government operations agency, said California high schools are part of the deal with Adobe, which aims to promote “AI literacy,” the idea that students and teachers should have basic skills to detect and use artificial intelligence.
Much like the community college system, which is governed by local districts, Musallam said individual K-12 districts would need to approve any deal. 
Will deals make a difference to students, teachers?
Experts say it’s too early to tell how effective AI training will actually be.  
Justin Reich, an associate professor at MIT, said a similar frenzy took place 20 years ago when teachers tried to teach computer literacy. “We do not know what AI literacy is, how to use it, and how to teach with it. And we probably won’t for many years,” Reich said. 
The state’s new deals with Google, Microsoft, Adobe and IBM allow these tech companies to recruit new users — a benefit for the companies — but the actual lessons aren’t time-tested, he said. 
“Tech companies say: ‘These tools can save teachers time,’ but the track record is really bad,” said Reich. “You cannot ask schools to do more right now. They are maxed out.”
Erin Mote, the CEO of an education nonprofit called InnovateEDU, said she agrees that state and education leaders need to ask critical questions about the efficacy of the tools that tech companies offer but that schools still have an imperative to act. 
“There are a lot of rungs on the career ladder that are disappearing,” she said. “The biggest mistake we could make as educators is to wait and pause.”
Last year, the California Community Colleges Chancellor’s Office signed an agreement with NVIDIA, a technology infrastructure company, to offer AI training similar to the kinds of lessons that Google, Microsoft, Adobe and IBM will deliver. 
Melissa Villarin, a spokesperson for the chancellor’s office, said the state won’t share data about how the NVIDIA program is going because the cohort of teachers involved is still too small.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Community-College-Budget-LJ-03.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-11 08:57:43.423165

Doug Slater, a chaplain from Joint Base San Antonio-Randolph, Texas, preaches to attendees during service at the chapel on Columbus Air Force Base, Mississippi, in this 2019 file photo. (Photo by Airman Hannah Bean/U.S. Air Force)In the gilded sanctuaries of America’s churches, a new kind of sermon is being preached—not one of salvation, but one of electioneering. Thanks to the IRS’s quietly seismic reinterpretation of the Johnson Amendment, pastors may now endorse candidates from the pulpit without fear of losing their tax-exempt status. The cross has been joined by the campaign banner.
This evolution — or erosion — is not merely a bureaucratic quirk. It is a radical shift in nonprofit oversight, one that invites political operatives to launder influence through houses of worship, cloaked in immunity and shielded by the First Amendment.
When a pastor delivers an endorsement mid-sermon, the offering plate becomes a conduit for tax-deductible campaign contributions. In that moment, the line between theological truth and political talking point vanishes.
Pastors are finally free to speak — will they have the courage?

And yet, where is the accountability?
The IRS has, in essence, created a special class of nonprofit untouchables. Secular charities face strict scrutiny if they dabble in electoral politics — but churches can now participate freely under the veil of religious expression. This is not equal enforcement. It is institutional favoritism.
More troubling is the collapse of transparency. Religious organizations are not required to disclose their donors. When these entities engage in political speech, we lose sight of where money is flowing and whose interests are being served. Dark money doesn’t have to hide anymore — it can simply congregate.
Democracy suffers when campaign finance laws stop at the sanctuary doors. Free speech is a pillar of our republic, yes — but tax benefits are not a birthright. They are a social contract, granted in exchange for civic responsibility and nonpartisan service. When that contract is broken, the public foots the bill for partisan pulpits.
It’s time to rewrite the rules.
Congress must act decisively. The Truth in Political Advertising Act should define nonprofit political speech clearly, enforce donor transparency across the board, and end the double standards that threaten civic trust. Let churches preach freely — but not at the expense of the voter’s right to know.
If sermons have become stump speeches, then the tax-exempt status should come with campaign finance strings. We fund pulpits for prophecy, not propaganda. And we deserve a democracy whose soul isn’t sold behind closed chapel doors.

Many have been told that if you dare to teach your congregations how biblical principles apply to elections, if they ever endorsed a candidate or spoke too directly about public policy, they would jeopardize their church’s tax-exempt status.
This chilling effect traces back to the Johnson Amendment of 1954, a politically motivated punitive measure meant to silence the famed senator’s political opponents, long been used to muzzle churches on matters of politics and policy.
Last month, that muzzle finally dropped. In a groundbreaking move, the IRS clarified that pastors and religious leaders are not bound by the Johnson Amendment when speaking to their own congregations. They can preach the full counsel of God, including guidance on civic engagement, candidates, and legislation. They no longer have to fear losing their tax-excempt status.
Crosses, campaigns and cloakrooms: How tax-free pulpits became political podiums

This is a monumental announcement that extends a precious gift to every Marylander of faith, no matter their religion or politics.
Yet as much as I celebrate this decision, I’m also sobered by a hard truth: laws and court decisions can change overnight, but courage is harder to summon.
For years, pastors convinced themselves that staying silent on politics was simply prudent. They reasoned, “If I avoid endorsing candidates or wading into legislation, more people hear the Gospel and I preserve the peace.”
But that caution is rooted more in misunderstanding and complacency, rather than in truth. Worse, it is bolstered by a deeper myth that has done untold damage to our country: The false idea of a rigid “separation of church and state,” which supposedly prohibits the church from influencing civic life.
The Constitution says nothing about separation of church and state. Nor is it what Scripture teaches. In fact, the Bible offers no divide between sacred and secular. To paraphrase Abraham Kuyper’s famous line, there is not a single square inch of this world over which Christ does not declare, “Mine!”

Because many pastors have lacked the courage to speak boldly into the public square, generations of believers have not been discipled to think biblically about politics. The result? Churches that shy away from teaching on critical cultural questions, and Christians who cast votes without considering or understanding how timeless truths should shape their civic choices.
This is why the IRS ruling is both liberating and convicting. It removes every last excuse for timid pulpits. Pastors can now freely endorse candidates and equip their flocks to advocate for legislation that aligns with biblical principles, using every modern means at their disposal.
In this digital age, that doesn’t just mean Sunday sermons. It includes livestreams, email newsletters, Facebook videos, podcasts, and every other platform where churches already connect with their congregations.
Still, I fear that some pastors will cling to silence. The IRS may have taken off the shackles, but not every pastor will find the will to walk free. They will continue to avoid “controversial” topics, not out of legal necessity, but because they lack the fortitude to risk pushback.
That’s a tragedy. Because when pastors shrink back, they rob their congregations — not of political opinions, but of the full counsel of God. They leave believers spiritually underfed, unequipped to bring biblical wisdom into the voting booth, the school board meeting or the halls of Annapolis.
It doesn’t have to be this way. It is time to change the norm. I am hopeful that courageous pastors, who understand there is no aspect of life untouched by God’s authority, will lead by example. That their boldness will inspire others to step forward and teach their people how to live out their faith fully, including in public life.
At the Maryland Family Institute, we stand ready to come alongside churches, parishes and congregations in this mission. We want to see Maryland’s pulpits ablaze with truth, unafraid to speak on biblical issues that shape our families, our communities, and our laws. We want to see believers equipped not only to worship on Sunday but to live and witness wisely on Tuesday at the polls.
So yes, the IRS ruling is cause for celebration. It is a victory for free speech, for religious liberty, and ultimately for the health of our democracy. But it is also a test for pastors.

Gaines/Maryland Matters)The annual Maryland Association of Counties summer conference has evolved into several things over the years.
It’s a forum for wonky discussions about near- and long-term policy and budgetary challenges. An opportunity for local bureaucrats to network and refresh their professional skills and credentials. A venue for vendors to peddle their services to government procurement officers. A chance for the governor to report to his fellow policymakers.
And it’s become party central, with a dizzying array of round-the-clock fundraisers, receptions and other social gatherings at bars and restaurants throughout Ocean City.
But at its most basic level, MACo is the biggest gathering of Maryland’s political clan of the year. So with the critical 2026 elections just around the corner, the political landscape is sure to be Topic A as Maryland leaders descend on the state’s top resort town for sand, surf, strategizing and soothsaying.
At first glance, 2026 in Maryland appears to be a sleepier and less consequential cycle than the historic election of 2022, when there were vacancies for all four statewide offices – governor, lieutenant governor, comptroller and attorney general – and voters chose trailblazers for each position.
All four – Gov. Wes Moore (D) and his running mate, Lt. Gov. Aruna Miller (D), along with Comptroller Brooke Lierman (D) and Attorney General Anthony Brown (D) – are early favorites for reelection. Some may have no serious opposition at all.
But with the national political dynamic so tumultuous – and with Maryland disproportionately impacted by the chaos and uncertainty in the federal government – state and local races will be affected in myriad, incalculable ways. Moore’s prominence as a probable presidential contender in 2028 will add to the weight and scrutiny of the 2026 outcome here.
“I think unpredictable is the word,” said Jessica Haire, a Republican former county councilmember from Anne Arundel County, who is chair of Opportunity Maryland, an advocacy group promoting economic growth and free market policies.
Maryland’s elections coincide with a period of instability and voter anger rarely seen in modern politics. National polls show voters deeply unhappy with both major political parties. And that could produce some surprising results in Maryland and beyond.
“The word that keeps coming back to me is disquiet – there’s disquiet in the electorate,” said Len Foxwell, a Democratic consultant.
Ordinarily, in the first midterm election of a president’s term, the “out” party makes significant gains – and there are certainly ingredients in place that could make it a good cycle for Democrats in 2026.
But assumptions about the midterms, and their consequences for 2028, become tricky in the volatile age of President Donald Trump, who has remade government, political discourse and media coverage in remarkable ways. Democrats, who are simultaneously looking to shake off their demoralizing defeat to Trump and are grappling with ideological, generational and tactical battles throughout the country, may be taking their 2026 prospects for granted.
“I think, both locally and nationally, we assume everybody’s going to be where they are, from the governor to all elected officials,” said former Prince George’s County Executive Rushern Baker (D). “But we don’t really know how they’re going to wind up.”
At the dawn of this year’s MACo conference, it’s easy to see that county elections will be among the most hard-fought and significant of the 2026 cycle.
Four of the state’s biggest counties will be electing new executives next year, and “each race will be brutal,” a leading state Democratic operative predicts. Several downballot elections in the counties – including internecine battles for state’s attorney, sheriff, county council seats and other offices – will be equally tempestuous.
“The greatest opportunity for political dynamism next year rests not with state elections or the General Assembly but with our county governments,” Foxwell said.
Known unknowns
Maryland’s 2026 primaries are on June 30. The candidate filing deadline is on Feb. 24.
Some key questions about 2026 races remain unanswered:
– Will former Gov. Larry Hogan (R) try to get his old job back, setting up an epic battle with Moore? Hogan has been strafing Moore on social media, but has taken no overt steps to organize a campaign; strategists on both sides of the aisle believe he is almost certainly the GOP’s best hope next year.
“I think the governor will win,” Baker said of Moore. “I think he could win big. But he will definitely have vigorous opposition.”
– Will U.S. Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-5th), the longest-serving member of the House of Representatives in Maryland history, seek another term next year, when he will be 87 years old? Not even his closest friends seem to know – and several downballot races could be impacted if he chooses to call it a career, as ambitious pols scramble to succeed him.
Baker said Hoyer’s plans may hinge on whether he thinks Democrats can retake the majority in the U.S. House.
– Even more basically, will Maryland lawmakers seek to redraw the state’s congressional lines next year, as state House Majority Leader David Moon (D-Montgomery) has suggested, in retaliation for mid-decade redistricting efforts underway in Texas and other Republican-dominated legislatures?
“Does Maryland respond to Texas?” asked Mileah Kromer, a pollster and director of the University of Maryland Baltimore County Institute for Politics. “That decision could have serious political ramifications.”
Moon plans to introduce legislation that would require Maryland lawmakers to consider a mid-decade remap of congressional boundaries if another state changes its map. But even Moon, in an interview, said it wasn’t clear if the bill would mandate action or produce new district lines before the 2026 election, or if Democratic leaders will choose that path.
“At a certain point, a lot of these decisions go above my pay grade,” he said.
Through a spokesperson, Moore told The Baltimore Sun last week that he would consider “all options” on redistricting.
Democrats already hold a 7-1 advantage in the state’s House delegation, so making U.S. Rep. Andy Harris (R-1st) vulnerable would require even more gerrymandering. He won reelection by 22 points last year, and Jake Day (D), Moore’s charismatic state secretary of Housing and Community Development, is pondering a challenge.
But the task of weakening Harris’ political position may not be impossible: Only the 6th congressional district, occupied by freshman Rep. April McClain Delaney (D), is remotely competitive. She won her seat last fall by a little over 5 points; the state’s other six Democrats won theirs by an average of 45 points, with victory margins ranging from 18 points (Rep. Johnny Olszewski Jr.) to 77 points (Rep. Glenn Ivey). Some of these members would have to sacrifice safe Democratic territory to put Harris’ seat in play.
And it’s worth pointing out that a court in 2022 rejected Maryland Democrats’ attempts to put Harris’ district in play as unconstitutional.
Democratic gerrymandering has also limited the number of competitive seats in the General Assembly. Can Republicans target more than a handful of Democratic-controlled seats next year? Do Democrats have any pick-up opportunities in GOP districts?
If there are any vulnerable state legislators in 2026, they may face more peril in their party primaries than in the general election. Democratic supermajorities in the state Senate and House of Delegates do not appear to be in any danger at this point.
A bigger and more basic question is whether the two parties in Maryland are even equipped to challenge for seats where the other side has long dominated.
Republicans have won three of the last six gubernatorial elections, but the state GOP is in thrall to Trump, who has appeal in conservative pockets of Maryland but limits the party’s ability to compete statewide and in bigger jurisdictions. Republicans are unlikely to run a strong candidate for Howard County executive next year, even though the GOP held the job as recently as 2018; the same may be true in Baltimore County and Anne Arundel County, depending on Haire’s plans. Bigger Republican benches in conservative jurisdictions have yet to yield candidates who can compete at the statewide level or for many congressional seats.
Conservative Democratic elected officials have all but vanished in Maryland; they controlled the General Assembly just a generation ago. Democrats have seemingly impenetrable advantages in several large suburban counties that were swing areas just a few elections ago. But as Maryland Democrats become more liberal and more in sync with the national party, their ability to make gains in conservative parts of the state diminishes.
Partisan arguments and counter-arguments
Even with the conflicting political signals, smart minds in both parties in Maryland see reason for optimism this election cycle.
Moon, the House majority leader, said Trump’s assault on the federal government and programs resonate in every corner of Maryland, benefiting Democrats.
“It’s a midterm where the GOP has set out to destroy our state,” he said. “We’ve got a cannon aimed directly at our head – we’ve got to do our best to dodge it.”
Sophia Silbergeld, a Baltimore-based Democratic fundraiser and strategist, said state Democrats will prosper if they portray themselves as a bulwark against Trump policies.
“As long as Democrats message strategically and paint themselves as an alternative to Trump, they will do well in Maryland in 2026,” she said. “State and local officials can message that they’re the last bastion against the Trump administration.”
But Jim Burton, a former executive director of the Maryland Republican Party, said tax and fee increases pushed through by Moore and legislative Democrats over the past two years could come back to haunt them electorally; he sees some of the same elements at play this cycle that propelled former Republican Govs. Larry Hogan and Bob Ehrlich to victory and almost elected Ellen Sauerbrey governor in 1994.
“We don’t know what the environment will look like in a year and a few months from now, but there are a lot of things on the table that could be a problem for Democrats,” said Burton, a pollster who advises GOP clients in Maryland and other states. “We could be looking at a period of history repeating itself. I like the situation that we’re in right now.”
Kromer acknowledged that voters will be driven by economic issues, but noted that the impact of the Trump administration’s policies on the state will also be top-of-mind to Democratic voters, making it difficult for Republican candidates to piece together a broad coalition, as Hogan did so deftly in 2014 and 2018.
“Like all voters, Democrats are driven by taxes and cost-of-living issues, but they’re particularly angry about Trump being back in the White House, and that anger will create a serious obstacle for Moore’s eventual challenger,” she said. “Just look at what happened in 2022.”
Foxwell said rising utility costs are a source of great outrage for voters and present a major challenge for Maryland political leaders in both parties.
“The one issue that keeps blinking as a big issue for me is the cost of energy, and it poses risks for Democrats and Republicans,” he said. “The proclivity of Annapolis lawmakers for blaming [grid operator] PJM is a losing strategy. People don’t know what PJM is, and they know they didn’t vote for PJM.”
Known knowns
One thing that is certain about the 2026 election in Maryland is that the open-seat races for county executive in Anne Arundel, Baltimore, Howard and Montgomery counties will be among the most intense of the cycle – especially in the Democratic primaries.
“The theater of combat in the counties this cycle is not going to be Republicans vs. Democrats, but establishment Democrats vs. insurgents,” Foxwell predicted.
Anne Arundel, considered a purple jurisdiction, is a paradox: Democrats have made significant and potentially durable gains in the last few elections, even as angry divides have erupted among party leaders and activists – especially since the death in 2019 of the late House Speaker Michael E. Busch (D), who had a robust political organization and was a unifying figure for county Democrats.
The Democratic race to replace term-limited County Executive Steuart Pittman (D) features County Councilmembers Alison Pickard and Pete Smith, and James Kitchin, a top aide to Pittman who has his boss’ support. Skirmishing among the candidates and their supporters seems inevitable. Even so, the Democrats are likely to hold the seat if Haire does not run – and might be favored, given the national dynamics of the political cycle, even if she does.
Haire, who lost to Pittman by 7 points in 2022, said she is still pondering her political options for 2026 but doesn’t think Anne Arundel voters will be swayed by the national political dynamic.
“We have an electorate that really pays attention, and local issues really matter to folks,” she said.
Baltimore County features a four-way Democratic primary to replace County Executive Kathy Klausmeier (D), who was appointed to complete the final two years of Olszewski’s tenure and isn’t expected to seek a full term of her own. The wide-open race features Councilmembers Julian Jones, Izzy Patoka and Pat Young, along with Nick Stewart, a businessman, attorney and former county school board member.
Republicans have yet to put up a candidate for the race, but intriguingly, former state Sen. Jim Brochin, a moderate who lost the 2018 Democratic primary to Olszewski by just 17 votes, has floated the possibility of running in the general election as an independent. He could be formidable, if he gets sufficient funding.
In Howard County, Del. Jessica Feldmark (D), who served as chief of staff to former County Executive Ken Ulman (D), is likely to rack up a substantial amount of establishment support as she looks to replace the outgoing executive, Calvin Ball (D). Councilmembers Deb Jung and Liz Walsh are also seeking the Democratic nomination, and the field could grow.
No Republican has come forward yet in Howard, and it’s hard to see a strong contender emerging. Allan Kittleman was the GOP nominee in the last three elections – winning once and losing twice.
In Montgomery County, County Executive Marc Elrich (D) is term limited, and three young Democratic council members are the leading candidates, so far, to replace him: Andrew Friedson (39), Evan Glass (48) and Will Jawando (42). The last Republican county executive was elected in 1974.
At least three of the open-seat candidates for county executive in the state – Feldmark, Pickard and Smith – have scheduled fundraisers in Ocean City this week to coincide with MACo. So has Frederick County Executive Jessica Fitzwater (D), who is seeking a second term.
As usual, Ocean City will be the center of the political universe for a few days this week. By the time next summer’s MACo conference takes place, the 2026 primaries will have come and gone – and the world could look a lot different.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/maco-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-11 08:57:43.423165

Underwater grasses continued to mount a comeback in the lower Chesapeake Bay last year, while a steady recovery also continued in upper portions of the Bay.
Areas in between were a different story, as declines in the mid-section of the Chesapeake more than offset improvements elsewhere.
Overall, data from the 2024 aerial survey showed a mixed bag of results, with the Baywide acreage of underwater meadows — one of the Chesapeake’s most critical habitats — decreasing by about 1% but with diverse trends in different areas.
“This year really shows just how dynamic the system is, that we can have two very different trends emerge in different areas,” said Chris Patrick, a researcher with the Virginia Institute of Marine Science who oversees the annual aerial survey of grass beds.
Indeed, last year saw more underwater grasses in the high salinity waters of the lower Bay than had been observed since the survey began four decades ago. The Susquehanna Flats in the upper Bay also saw significant expansion. But the mid-Bay saw large losses, especially along the Eastern Shore.
Altogether, the 2024 survey found 82,778 acres of submerged aquatic vegetation, or SAV, down from 83,419 acres in 2023.
That is well below the Chesapeake Bay Program goal of 185,000 acres, though it is significantly more than the 38,227 acres observed in 1984 when the survey began.
Underwater grass beds provide an important refuge for juvenile blue crabs and fish, as well as food for water­fowl. Plus, they pump oxygen into the water, their roots help stabilize sedi­ment and their leaves buffer wave action.
They are also a closely watched indicator of Bay health because the plants require clear water to get the sunlight needed to survive. They die off when sediment and nutrient-fueled algae blooms cloud the water.
But grass beds are not the same throughout the Chesapeake. Beds in different areas consist of different species based on the salinities of the water, and they can be impacted by local factors as opposed to Baywide conditions.
That might have been at play last year in the mid-Bay where higher than normal spring river flows shifted sharply to lower than normal summer flows. That might have contributed to Eastern Shore losses, said Brooke Landry, a biologist with the Maryland Department of Natural Resources and chair of the state-federal Bay Program’s SAV Workgroup.
“It shows that we’re still susceptible to climate change, with super hot water and highly variable river flows potentially impacting the grasses as well as overall water quality,” she said.
Here’s how the Bay fared in different regions last year.
High salinity zone
The best news was in the high salinity, or polyhaline, portion of the Bay, which stretches south from the Rappahannock River and Tangier Island to the mouth of the Bay. The survey found 24,800 acres of grass in that area, a 14% increase from 2023 and the most recorded since the survey began.
It’s especially good news because the area is dominated by eelgrass, a species that is especially sensitive to warming temperatures and poor water quality and has suffered repeated setbacks over the years. As Bay temperatures have increased, polyhaline SAV coverage declined to just 11,975 acres in 2019.
Patrick said the comeback was driven in part by better water clarity, which means the plants get more light and allows eelgrass to move into deeper waters — sometimes as deep as 9 feet.
Last year saw notable increases in Mobjack Bay, Poquoson Flats and nearby Western Shore areas.
“We’ve seen a lot of big expansions,” Patrick said, including areas where grasses had not previously been observed. “It certainly looks like this is tied to improving water clarity. I mean, anecdotally, the water looks clear to me out there.”
The Bay Program goal for the polyhaline is 33,647 acres.
Tidal fresh zone
The tidal fresh zone of the upper Bay and upper portions of its tidal tributaries had 20,218 acres, a 2% increase from last year.
The large grass bed in the Susquehanna Flats, located near the mouth of the Bay’s largest tributary, increased to 10,925 acres last year. That was a 2% increase from 2023 and accounted for slightly more than half of all SAV in tidal fresh waters.
The tidal fresh zone, which hosts more than a dozen SAV species, also saw notable increases in Maryland’s Northeast River on the upper Eastern Shore and in Piscataway Creek off the Potomac River.
Not all the news was good. In Virginia, the upper Mattaponi River and upper portions of the tidal James River saw losses.
The Bay Program goal for the tidal fresh zone is 20,602 acres.
Low salinity zone
The slightly salty oligohaline zone, a relatively small area which includes portions of the up­per Bay and tidal tributaries, saw a 46% increase, to 4,730 acres.
Much of that was a bounce back from losses in recent years, particularly in and near Maryland’s Gunpowder and Middle rivers, which had seen recent declines. Other areas with increases included the Elk, Sassafras, Bush, and Back rivers in Maryland; the middle Potomac; and the middle Rappahannock in Virginia.
But the Chickahominy River in Virginia suffered a significant decline.
The oligohaline zone has the least amount of potential underwater grass habitat, with a Bay Program goal of 10,334 acres.
Mid-salinity zone
The mesohaline zone, with mid-range salinity, suffered a 14% decline, dropping to 33,031 acres. It has the largest amount of potential SAV habitat — its restoration goal is 120,306 acres — and it stretches southward from near Baltimore to the Rappahannock River and Tangier Island in Virginia. It includes large sections of most tidal rivers.
It is dominated by widgeon grass, which is notorious for rapid changes linked to water quality.
Most of the larger losses were along the Eastern Shore. In the lower Choptank River grass coverage fell by 2,200 acres, which made scientists think local conditions were at play.
Patrick said it is likely that heavy spring rains washed more nutrients off the land, which led to reduced water clarity in the Choptank and some other rivers in the area.
Landry said rapid salinity changes, spurred by high flow events in the spring and near-drought conditions in the summer, may have contributed to losses. “While widgeon grass does have a really broad salinity tolerance, it doesn’t respond well to rapid changes in salinity particularly when stressed by water quality,” she said.
While the area saw overall losses, some locations had notable increases, including the Patapsco River in Maryland and the Piankatank River in Virginia.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/689217d45061b.1-1024x668.jpeg,,,2025-08-11 08:57:43.423165

(Photo courtesy of Justine Wilson)When Siri Fiske founded the Mysa Microschool in Washington, D.C., in 2016, there wasn’t a widely accepted term for her small, one-room schoolhouse model.
Now, the school is referred to on its website as one of the first microschools in the nation, and Fiske has seen a growing microschool movement since the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the five years since remote schooling amid pandemic-era lockdowns, microschools and homeschooling have emerged as increasingly popular alternatives to traditional public and private models. Smaller class sizes, individualized classrooms and lack of standardization are an appeal to parents, Fiske said.
“There’s this idea that people who open microschools are doing it for cultish or religious reasons, and there’s a misconception that all are like that,” Fiske said. “I’ve seen my students graduate into top colleges. There’s many ways to achieve academic success.”
Some education experts, however, have expressed concern about the growing movement. They question whether microschools are properly regulated and being held accountable, and whether they’ll pull dollars out of the public education system.
There is no federal definition of a microschool, and with the Trump administration’s plans to shutter the U.S. Department of Education, the onus is on states to figure them out.










Schools calling themselves microschools today are not what I would’ve called one back then. But I think that’s OK. It’s evolving.


– Siri Fiske, founder and head of Mysa School


In some states, microschools face a bind: If they operate as private schools, they’re required to meet facility, staffing and curricular standards that are often cost-prohibitive for schools their size. If they operate under homeschool laws, they face oversight, assessment mandates and reporting requirements that aren’t designed for multifamily or educator-led models.
Some states, including Georgia, Tennessee and Texas, have passed “Learning Rights Protection Acts” to codify microschools’ right to operate.
In Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts and Oregon, learning pods and microschools often face child care or private school licensing requirements if they involve multiple families, hire instructors or provide compensation for child care.
“Schools calling themselves microschools today are not what I would’ve called one back then. But I think that’s OK. It’s evolving,” Fiske said.
She pointed to the national school choice movement — and states such as West Virginia — for helping the microschool movement flourish.
In 2022, West Virginia became one of the few states to define a microschool, distinctly separating it from a private school, homeschool or learning pod.
Those classifications, and how these schools are funded and regulated, affect everything from whether a school must hire certified teachers to how it ensures student safety or civil rights protections. And with more public dollars flowing to private or hybrid learning options through vouchers and education savings accounts — to the detriment of public school funding, some argue — states will need to define these schools and their place in the ecosystem.
States will have to fill the gaps, said Weadé James, senior director of K-12 education policy with the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning policy think tank.
“Accountability can vary wildly. Some microschools aren’t required to have certified teachers, conduct annual assessments, or even guarantee civil rights protections,” said James. “If public voucher dollars are going to a microschool, there has to be some level of oversight and accountability.”
Many microschools aren’t accredited
Microschools defy easy classification, and many advocates argue that’s by design. Don Soifer, CEO of the National Microschooling Center, an industry group, cautions lawmakers against rushing to impose fixed legal definitions.
“Innovation is happening too fast. The moment you define it in law, it becomes obsolete,” Soifer said.

Read the series >


A 2024 sector analysis by the National Microschooling Center — one of the only sources of national data on the topic — found that many schools are operating outside traditional education principles.
In a survey of 400 microschools across 41 states, more than 60% of founders reported they were not currently licensed educators. Eighty-four percent reported their schools were not accredited. Among prospective founders, 48% are licensed educators (though only 14% currently work in public schools), 32% come from non-education fields, and 23% are parents building schools for their own children.
Most microschools (55%) operate under homeschool laws, while others function as private schools (37%), charters (6%) or fall into unique state categories (3%), according to the analysis.
“So, you can be a private or homeschool microschool program, where you aren’t required to provide students with certified teachers, or you aren’t required to conduct annual assessments,” James said.
Often described as “homeschool hybrids” or “small-scale learning communities,” microschools often serve around 16 students or fewer, and tend to cater to families with average or above-average incomes in their area. In some states, microschools have been authorized to receive public funds through voucher programs.
Some critics note that, like private schools, microschools may charge tuition, potentially excluding lower-income families and contributing to educational disparities.
These schools often operate in commercial spaces (41%), private residences (28%) or houses of worship (25%), according to the National Microschooling Center. The center also found the movement is diversifying: 37% of prospective founders are people of color, compared with 27% of current operators.
Because building and zoning codes vary from state to state and locality to locality, many operators may be unaware of the extra costs to meet school codes standards. Fiske recalls difficulties in expanding from Washington, D.C., to Vermont, which has stricter laws on water fountain requirements.
“Most people in the U.S. starting a microschool are doing it under the radar because the regulations to open a licensed school are so intense,” Fiske said. For the new school, she recalled, “it took us forever, and we had to install ADA-compliant toilets and water fountains for just 10 kids in Vermont.”
‘Microschooling is not one thing’
Microschools also operate in a legal gray zone, often outside the traditional K-12 system and subject to a patchwork of state and local policies that can either support or constrain their growth.
Growth has accelerated in conservative-leaning states with robust school choice programs, such as Arizona and Florida. Other states, such as Maryland, New York and North Dakota, have more restrictive homeschool or private school laws.
“Microschooling is not one thing. These schools look different in every state, and the policy frameworks around them vary wildly,” said Soifer, of the National Microschooling Center.
What is classified as a microschool can vary from “10 kids in a basement in Kentucky” to a 200-kid schoolhouse elsewhere.
Fiske said states need to create a way for operators and parents to know what to expect in a certain state, and help willing operators get the education and business acumen they need to run the schools successfully.
“But if you look at who is starting microschools in the U.S., it’s a lot of millennial parents who may not have any teacher training but wanted to create a learning environment for their children and others in the local community,” said Fiske. “And without efforts by the state to provide some incentives to earn accreditation and information as both a school and a small business, a few of these will find themselves going under.”
Seeking choices
After two decades working in conventional schools in the United States and around the world — including in Brazil, Egypt and Qatar — Justine Wilson turned down a high-paying leadership role at a prestigious private school. Instead, in 2023 she opened Curious and Kind Education, a two-day-a-week microschool in Sarasota, Florida, built around trust, nature-based learning and self-directed play.
New federal school voucher program poses a quandary for states: Opt in or opt out?

Enrollment at Curious and Kind is mostly driven by word of mouth, she said. The program now has a waitlist. And Wilson has seen her enrollment grow from 18 students in her first year to roughly 100 students for the upcoming school year.
“The number of 5-year-olds on my waitlist is shocking,” she said, “and then I realized they’re COVID babies and their parents have really been driving this search for alternative schooling since the pandemic.”
James, of the Center for American Progress, questions whether microschools generally match the quality of traditional public schools, which still educate more than 80% of schoolchildren. She says families may be under the assumption that school choice options equate to better quality.
“We have created an illusion of choice to be quality, and I think a lot of families are seeking various choice options because they associate that with quality. But that doesn’t necessarily mean that where those students are going is any better than where they left,” she said.
“We need to take a closer look at what we are presenting to families,” James said. “It’s not just about having options and having a choice. It’s about having quality choice options.”
That quality, Soifer said, is what microschools are trying to achieve.
“Microschools do very well on the left, on the right … at the top end of the economy and at the fragile end of the income spectrum,” he said. “It’s really a matter of the new economy and a new way of thinking about education.”

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)The U.S. Election Assistance Commission — an independent, bipartisan commission charged with ensuring secure, accurate and accessible elections — is launching a national effort to recruit poll workers, including in Utah. 
“Utah needs you,” Commissioner Donald Palmer said in an interview with Utah News Dispatch on Friday. 
Tuesday — which is also Utah’s municipal primary — is National Poll Worker Recruitment Day, when the U.S. Election Assistance Commission kicks off a nationwide effort to encourage more people to volunteer at their local county clerks office and sign up to be election workers ahead of the November general election. 
“Where there’s a primary, there’s always going to be a general (election),” Palmer quipped, saying the aim of scheduling National Poll Worker Recruitment Day on the same day of municipal primaries is to recruit more poll workers ahead of the 2025 November election, when voters typically turn out in higher numbers. 
‘Go see for yourself’: These poll workers want to demystify the voting process for you

By raising awareness on a day when Utahns are thinking about their local elections, Palmer said he hopes more Utahns will consider being a part of the process this fall. 
Across the nation, clerks are seeing a “dramatic decrease in the number of poll workers available,” Palmer said, noting that for the 2024 presidential election, 772,000 Americans served as poll workers, according to the 2024 Election Administration and Voting Survey Report. That’s down from what’s typically been 1 million. 
While it’s been getting incrementally easier to recruit election volunteers since 2020, recruitment efforts have trended easier since 2020, still about 48% of clerks’ elections jurisdictions across the nation reported it’s either “very difficult” or “somewhat difficult” to find poll workers, according to that survey. Of that 48%, 14.3% said it’s “very difficult” while 33.6% said it’s “somewhat difficult.” 
While Utah is not facing a dire poll worker shortage, Palmer said he’s still encouraging Utahns to volunteer, noting that what he hears most from Utah clerks is a need to help process by-mail ballots since the vast majority of Utah voters use the state’s vote-by-mail system. 
He also said some counties are in more need than others — noting that rural areas with smaller populations often face more challenges recruiting poll workers. 
In Utah during the 2024 November election, 104,350 people cast ballots in person on Election Day and 36,381 people voted early in person, while about 1.3 million by-mail ballots were cast and counted, according to the national survey. 
By comparison, Utah only reported 1,110 total poll workers for that election. 
That survey also showed that in 2025, about 40% of Utah’s poll workers were new recruits. 
Palmer said that shows there’s been “a lot of turnover” and “a need for poll workers” in Utah — demonstrating that people are not volunteering anymore, likely because they’re getting older or are no longer able to. 
“We have an aging population of poll workers,” Palmer said. 
He noted that the survey found the vast majority of poll workers in 2024 were over the age of 40, with nearly 60% ages 61 and older. That includes 31.1% that were between the ages of 61 and 70, and 28.1% that were 71 and older. 
Republicans are losing trust in elections, even in Utah. What should be done?

“It really does (show) we need to start recruiting younger and middle-aged Americans to really fill the gap. Because at some point, they’re going to retire,” he said.
Palmer urged younger Utahns — who may not even be aware of the opportunity to serve their communities in this way — to consider being an election worker.
“I really encourage people to try (volunteering) at least one or two elections, because it will give you great insight, and the people that continue on year after year, some of these folks, they absolutely love it. They’re going to do it for the rest of their lives,” he said. “So we really do want young people and other Americans to see the voting process.”
He also said more people being involved in local election processes can help combat rising distrust in election security. 
“It’s right on the ground. You can see how the voting process works,” he said. “You really do, as a poll worker, get to see the checks and balances within a polling place. You get to see the efforts that go into chain of custody and how we make sure the ballots equate to the number of people that have voted. And the care that’s taken with those ballots. … It really is the best place to understand how the voting process works.”
“There really does need to be replacement poll workers as we move to the future,” he said.

(Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)This is the third of a three-part series on Alabama school districts under state intervention. Part 1 on Bessemer City Schools is here. Part 2 on Dallas County Schools is here.  
On a recent June day, Sumter County Schools students  went to the front office to get permission slips signed on one of the last days of summer school. 
While parents work, the kids are able to get a head start in their new grade through the summer bridge program. As Sumter County Schools Superintendent Marcy Burroughs was walking down the hall, a student called after her asking for summer learning to be extended.
“I’m bored inside the house,” he said.
Burroughs teased the student.
“So you want to do year-round school?” She asked him. He shook his head, seemingly wishing he never said a word.
Burroughs continued on, explaining the upgrades made to the school, like a new camera system and new HVACs throughout the school. 
Sumter is consolidating all its schools on the campus of Sumter Central High School. The high school itself lies in the shadow of a new elementary school wing. 
When the Alabama State Department of Education took over Sumter County Schools in August 2023, the district had 923 students between its four schools, a drop of more than 100 from the year prior.
Intervention takes many different forms around the state; in Sumter, it will end in school closures and new construction. State Superintendent Eric Mackey plans to close three schools and move them to the York Central High School campus, into a new facility for elementary students.
The $14 million construction is set to be completed by December, Burroughs said. 
“We’re hoping to be in by January, but with the weather and the rain,” Burroughs said. “We will definitely be in by next August.”
The school closures, Mackey said in a phone interview Thursday, were necessary due to the condition of the facilities and low membership.
“York West End (Junior High School) has a whole wing that is not available to be occupied because of structural problems, but it’s a big school that was built decades ago, so you still had plenty of room because there were so few students,” Mackey said. “Nevertheless, you’ve got this whole section of the building that you can’t even go in, and which always is, to me, that’s a safety concern, even though we don’t have students housed there. And then Livingston Junior High, the other school, actually was condemned.”
Even Sumter Central High School, where the consolidated campus will be, is an older building, but HVAC replacements and minor renovations will keep it updated. Burroughs said the state replaced 30 HVACs in the building when they intervened two years ago, and the process was still ongoing during the summer.
Sumter County Schools was the first of three school systems under Mackey’s control, joined by Bessemer City Schools south of  Birmingham and Dallas County Schools in Selma.

Why the state intervened
The Sumter intervention, Mackey said, is unique because of how rural the county is. Sumter County, like many Black Belt counties, has seen significant population loss over the last few decades. The county lost 10.3% of its population from 2010 to 2020, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
That creates challenges. The falling population and difficulty accessing Sumter, on the state’s western border with Mississippi, makes it difficult to recruit teachers and staff. York Central High School has had three principals since the state intervened, Mackey said.
“There’s been a lot of teacher turnover too, and it’s hard to get people to drive there,” Mackey said. “There’s not a lot of housing in the community, so that’s been a struggle for them for a long time, and it’s been a little bit of a struggle even with the intervention.”
Although the construction of the consolidated campus is set to be completed in the next six months, Mackey said there will still be more work to do before the system’s autonomy is restored. One of those things is finances. 
John Heard, the state appointed chief administrative officer for the intervention, said in a recent interview that the system did not have their financials in line before intervention. Now, though, the school system has about four months worth of expenses in reserve, Heard said, about $6.2 million.
“That means they’re gonna have longevity in being able to do a good job keeping up with their finances,” Heard said.
Kinterbish Junior High School in Cuba, Alabama, the first school that was closed in 2023, had less than 70 students in 2022, according to state data. Mackey said the low membership overextended the school system’s staff and cost the district money. Those students were consolidated with York West End Junior High School in December 2023, which brought membership up to 276 students at the end of the 2023-24 school year, according to state data.
“They were overextended in the number of schools. That’s one of the real issues why they got into so many financial issues,” Mackey said. “It’s been one of their academic problems because they were trying to get teachers at all these different little schools and and it was really too much to staff.”
Another issue Mackey had was board governance. He said 18-24 months before the state intervened it recommended the closure of Kinterbish. The board, Mackey said, did not act on the recommendation.
“They were headed toward bankruptcy, and the things that had to be done to keep the system, solve it, mostly closing schools,” Mackey said. “I’m not saying they’re not willing. They were not able to get to the place where they could do it on their own.”
Even with consolidating schools, the system’s membership continues to decline. In the 2021-22 school year, Sumter County Schools had 1,068 students, according to state data. At the end of the 2023-24 school year, the school system had 910 students. Mackey said that some of the student movement is due to students attending University Charter School in the county, which enrolls 691 students.
Academics were also a concern. Sumter County Schools has been one of the state’s lowest performing schools for years, he said. In 2022, the system scored a 70 on the state report card and a 74 in 2024, according to state data. In 2024, the state average was an 85. 
In this year’s state reading test for second and third graders, 47% of Sumter’s second graders and 34% of third graders scored below the proficiency mark, which was raised nine points last year. Third graders system-wide are in the bottom ten school systems in proficiency. In the 2024 test, 40% of Sumter’s second graders and 19% of third graders scored below the proficiency mark.
“That’s a concern for all of us, that we make sure that we reach that goal and exceed it, really,” Heard said. “So there’s gonna be a lot of effort this year to spend more time working on that, to have some side by side coaching with students and teachers.”
Although focus is currently on construction and renovations, Mackey said that once the elementary school wing on Sumter Central High School’s campus is done they will be focusing more on academics.
He said Burroughs, who was appointed superintendent of Sumter County Schools two months before intervention, has an “academic mind” and will be able to improve the system’s academics.
“I think if we can get the other pieces taken care of, then she’ll be able to manage the academics,” he said.

Staff and community support
Burroughs and Heard said that they have not heard of any outright opposition to the intervention; however, they have heard some community members say they feel they’ve lost their voice.
“I think just the idea that the state is actually running the system does have some angst in some people,” Heard said. “I think a lot of people are excited about the fact that they’re getting a new facility.”
Board President Elanor James said in a recent interview that the progress the schools system has made would not have been possible without the state, but parents are wary of the future.
“There’s pros and cons to anything. Some say that they are happy that the state is here because we’re getting a new school, which we probably wouldn’t have gotten if the state intervention hadn’t come in,” James said. “Then some are kind of wary about it, they feel that the schools were doing OK.”
Sumter County teachers and staff said in interviews that they supported the intervention. 
Carla Landrum, a first grade teacher in the district, said she’s noticed teachers being more focused since intervention started.
“Everybody came in with a purpose. We knew what our kids needed. We wanted to make sure that that’s what they were getting,” Landrum said during the June site visit.
Natalie Adams, a second grade teacher, said the additional hands-on resources from the state have yielded a noticeable difference in the kids’ learning and engagement.
“I like them to collaborate so they can get an understanding that if they work together, someone may know something that someone else may know, may not know,” Adams said. “When they work together, it seems to work better for them.”
Burroughs said in a phone interview in June that intervention stabilized “finance, governance and academic oversight.”
“I had just gotten hired in July, and the state intervened in August, so it was kind of sort of like we came in both at the same time and we were able to develop a partnership.”
Heard accredits the success of the intervention to Mackey and the support from state personnel.
“Dr. Mackey had really committed his staff to just support us 100% whatever we needed, whether it was federal programs, whether it was a finance department, whether it was career tech,” Heard said. “He pretty much made his entire staff available to us for whatever we needed to make certain that we were doing the best possible approach for whatever we were doing.”

Now the practice of frequent redistricting is raising the possibility that a stalled ballot measure to create an independent redistricting commission in Nevada could be resurrected, and if successful, trickle down to local governments.
Councilwoman Carrie Cox, who is running for reelection next year, suggests the council is rejiggering the maps with an eye toward boosting prospects for her opponent, Nevada State Board of Education member Annette Dawson Owens, who has been endorsed by Cox’s fellow council members.
“When you have colleagues that do the things that I’ve had done to me, it’s an easy trip to know that something’s going on,” Cox said at the City Council meeting Tuesday, where she cast the lone vote against the redistricting plan recommended by staff.
Bad blood flows freely on the Henderson Council. 
“Every two weeks there’s a pattern, if you haven’t figured it out, with a false narrative right before a City Council meeting,” Councilwoman Monica Larson, the newest member of the council, said from the dais, referring to Cox. “The narrative spun was gerrymandering, but what I appropriately call it is grandstanding.”
“That’s absolutely not true,” Cox said Friday. “Review the City Council meeting recordings on the website. The only pattern is the rest of the council voting against me when I stand up for my constituents.” 
Larson, a California transplant, campaigned last year on the promise of aligning with Cox to turn back an “insular cabal” — a Las Vegas Review-Journal reference in its 2024 endorsement of Larson — of Mayor Michelle Romero and three council members who routinely voted in lockstep. 
Instead of teaming with Cox, Larson cozied up to Romero, Councilman Dan Stewart, and Councilman Jim Seebock. 
On Wednesday, Romero called out Cox’s campaign for issuing a news release that asserts there is “strong evidence that the mayor had authorized the use of internally crafted population estimates” for the redistricting effort.   
“Either the person making these statements has a profound lack of understanding of both our charter and our city operations, or they have purposefully misled the public with these statements,” Romero said. 
Reapportionment and redistricting efforts are conducted nationwide every ten years, following the completion of the U.S. Census, to ensure congressional and legislative districts represent roughly the same amount of residents.  
Unlike most Nevada municipalities, which rely on the Census to determine population, in 2013, Henderson, the second-fastest growing city in Nevada at the time (behind Las Vegas), won legislative approval to change its charter to let the city’s own demographer estimate each ward’s population. When the number of residents in one ward varies by more than 5% from another, the city must redraw its maps. 
The population of Ward Three exceeds that of Ward Four by 7.8% and the population of Ward Two exceeds that of Ward Four by 5.6%, according to Henderson’s longtime Demographer Andy Powell.  
“If we were, for instance, to go 10 years without redistricting, given the high rate of growth that we’ve seen, we could see upwards of 20, 25% difference in population between some of some of the wards, and that would effectively serve to dilute the voting power” of residents in faster-growing wards, Powell said at Wednesday’s meeting. 
The city redrew its ward maps in 2010, 2012, 2014, 2018, 2021, 2023, and 2025.
Cox says this is the second time Henderson has tweaked her ward since she was elected in 2022. 
“They once again tried to move over 40,000 residents, many of them my voters,” she said Friday.   
Henderson grew by 22% in the decade ending December 2023, according to a study based on the U.S. Census data. But growth has slowed. For the year ending in June 2024, the most recent data available from the state demographer, Henderson’s population of 350,706 grew by 2.6%. 
City staff presented two redistricting options to the council. 
Plan One would have affected 40,000 residents, or 11% of the population by moving a dozen precincts. Three precincts that were moved in 2023 would have moved again. 
Plan Two accomplished the same goal of reducing the disparity between ward population by moving one precinct of roughly 4,500 residents (1.4% of the city’s population) out of Cox’s Ward Three. 
The two plans submitted to the council by Henderson staff raise questions about the motivation behind the redistricting effort and the veracity of the city’s internal estimates, which some experts challenged, 
Voting rights advocate Sondra Cosgrove, among others, wondered why Henderson officials floated a plan to move 40,000 residents when the alternative — moving 4,500 residents to another ward — achieves the same outcome. 
“City staff followed industry best practices and the City Charter requirements to develop the proposed redistricting maps,” Henderson spokeswoman Madeleine Skains said via email. “Staff selected two plans for consideration because they minimize impact, best achieve population balance and align with the best practices and Charter requirements. Both plans were provided to give City Council options to balancing these priorities.”
Romero, who is also seeking reelection next year, did not respond to inquiries about whether she requested two plans. 
“I cannot see how moving one precinct from one ward into another is political,” Stewart said, as he made a motion to approve Plan Two, which passed four to one. 
Former Henderson Police Chief Hollie Chadwick, who is challenging Romero in the race for mayor, declined to say whether she believes Henderson should return to redistricting every 10 years. 
“If you’re continually being moved between one ward and another, voters don’t know who represents them,” says Cosgrove, a College of Southern Nevada professor who heads up Fair Maps Nevada PAC. The group has unsuccessfully tried to let voters decide if an independent redistricting commission is better suited than state lawmakers to draw the lines for legislative and congressional districts. 
In 2020, the pandemic put a crimp in Fair Map’s effort to collect signatures to put the redistricting revamp on the ballot. In 2024, the Nevada Supreme Court upheld a lower court ruling that struck down two similar initiatives slated for the ballot that year. The ruling in favor of a Democratic voter found the measures created a commission with no source of funding. 
Although the ballot measure doesn’t affect redistricting of local governments, Cosgrove says given the power of the state in Nevada over local governments, a successful effort to include a redistricting commission in the constitution could prompt the Legislature to direct cities and counties to follow suit, and redraw maps every 10 years. 
Sept. 1 is the first day to file constitutional amendment ballot questions. 
“We’ve been going back and forth about what’s the best approach to not get sued,” Cosgrove said Thursday regarding the measure’s potential ressurrection. “And right now, I don’t care about that anymore. Based on what’s happening in Texas, everybody sees how bad it is.”

(Photo by Amanda Hernández/Stateline)For years, state lawmakers have taken the lead on regulating kratom — the controversial herbal supplement used for pain relief, anxiety and opioid withdrawal symptoms. Some states have banned it entirely. Others have passed laws requiring age limits, labeling and lab testing.
At least half of the states and the District of Columbia have enacted some form of regulation on kratom or its components — building a patchwork of policies around a product largely unaddressed by the federal government.
But that may soon change.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is pushing to ban 7-hydroxymitragynine, or 7-OH — a powerful compound found in small amounts in kratom and sometimes concentrated or synthesized in products sold online, at smoke shops or behind gas station counters.
Federal health officials announced last month that the compound poses serious public health risks and should be classified as a Schedule I controlled substance, alongside heroin and LSD.
The move marks a significant shift in how federal regulators are approaching kratom, which they attempted to ban in 2016. It also has sparked debate about how the change could impact the growing 7-OH industry and its consumers.
A soon-to-be law regulates SC sales of a psychoactive herb. No, it’s not marijuana.

This year, at least seven states have considered bills to tighten kratom regulations, including proposals for bans, age restrictions and labeling requirements.
In South Carolina, a law signed in May after passing both chambers unanimously bans stores from selling kratom to anyone under 21. For legal sales to adults, kratom products must have “clear” labeling that includes ingredients, the amount of kratom, recommended amount for safe usage, and servings per container. The law also bans the sale of kratom products mixed with other things.
The law took effect July 11, exactly 60 days after Gov. Henry McMaster signed it.
The two-month delay was designed to give owners of the stores that sell the products time to comply, said the law’s author, state Sen. Russell Ott, D-St. Matthews.
Kratom, which originates from the leaves of a tree native to Southeast Asia, can have a wide range of mental and bodily effects, according to federal officials, addiction medicine specialists and kratom researchers.
Reports of fatal kratom overdoses have surfaced in recent years, though kratom is often taken in combination with other substances.










This is a public health crisis waiting to happen.


– Christopher McCurdy, professor of medicinal chemistry at the University of Florida


Kratom and 7-OH are distinct products with separate markets, but they are closely connected. 7-OH is a semi-synthetic compound derived from kratom and only emerged on the market in late 2023, while kratom itself has been available for decades.
Leading kratom researchers also say more research is needed to fully understand the long-term effects of using both substances.
“There’s much we don’t know, unfortunately, on all sides,” said Christopher R. McCurdy, a professor of medicinal chemistry at the University of Florida. McCurdy is a trained pharmacist and has studied kratom for more than 20 years.
Research suggests kratom may help with opioid withdrawal and doesn’t seem to cause severe withdrawal on its own. Smaller amounts seem to act as a stimulant, while larger doses may have sedative, opioidlike effects. Very little is known about the risks of long-term use in humans, according to McCurdy.
As for 7-OH, it shows potential for treating pain, but it hasn’t been studied in humans, and it may carry a high risk of addiction. Researchers don’t yet understand how much is safe to take or how often it should be used, McCurdy told Stateline.
While some leading kratom experts agree that kratom and 7-OH should be regulated, they caution that placing 7-OH under a strict Schedule I classification would make it much harder to study — and argue it should instead be classified as Schedule II like some other opioids.
A federal survey from 2023 estimated that about 1.6 million Americans age 12 and older used kratom in the year before the study. The American Kratom Association, a national industry lobbying group, estimated in 2021 that between 11 million and 16 million Americans safely consume kratom products each year.
Since gaining popularity in recent years, 7-OH has appeared in a growing number of products. Some researchers and addiction medicine specialists say many consumers, especially those new to kratom, sometimes don’t understand the difference between products.
“It’s a pure opioid that’s available without a prescription, so it’s akin to having morphine or oxycodone for sale at a smoke shop or a gas station,” McCurdy said. “This is a public health crisis waiting to happen.”
 Federal crackdown targets 7-OH, not kratom

In late July, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommended that the federal Drug Enforcement Administration place 7-OH in Schedule I, citing a high potential for abuse. The classification would not apply to kratom leaves or powders with naturally occurring 7-OH.
“We’re not targeting the kratom leaf or ground-up kratom,” FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said at a news conference. “We are targeting a concentrated synthetic byproduct that is an opioid.”
Makary acknowledged that there isn’t enough research or data to fully understand how widespread 7-OH’s use or impact may be. Still, he said the Trump administration wants to be “aggressive and proactive” in addressing the issue before it grows into a larger public health problem.
44 more people charged with trafficking drugs in SC fentanyl overdose investigation

While only small amounts of 7-OH occur naturally in the kratom plant, federal officials have raised concerns about U.S. products containing synthetic or concentrated forms of the compound because it’s more potent than morphine and primarily responsible for kratom’s opioidlike effects.
The FDA’s recommendation to schedule 7-OH will now go to the DEA, which oversees the final steps of the process — including issuing a formal proposal and opening a public comment period.
If finalized, the rule could affect both companies selling enhanced kratom products and consumers in states where those products are currently legal.
The DEA backed off scheduling kratom compounds in 2016 after widespread public opposition.
Kirsten Smith, an assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Johns Hopkins University who is studying kratom’s effects in humans, said she was surprised by the FDA’s push to schedule 7-OH.
“We don’t really have a public health signal of a lot of adverse events for either kratom or for 7-OH at this time,” she told Stateline. “I was, frankly, always surprised that kratom was pushed toward scheduling at an earlier time point. … I don’t know that we have data to support scheduling even now.”
Still, some advocacy groups, including the Holistic Alternative Recovery Trust, argue the push to schedule 7-OH is driven more by corporate interests than public health, suggesting the kratom industry is trying to sideline competition from 7-OH products.
“We think that this is just happening because of the legacy kratom manufacturers losing market share and wanting to gin up a crisis with this,” said Jeff Smith, the national policy director for the group, who said he has used 7-OH for sleep and pain management.
While his organization supports regulation and safe consumption, members worry the federal government’s move could drive people to riskier substances or push the market underground.
“It’s made a profound difference in my life,” Smith said. “We think it would be tragic to cut it off based on such a paucity of data when there’s so much potential for this product to help people.”
 Public health concerns

Federal health officials say a key concern is the growing use of kratom and 7-OH products among teens and young adults.
Some officials and addiction medicine specialists have pointed out that these products often come in flavors and packaging designed to appeal to younger buyers, with few controls over where or how they’re sold. In some states without clear regulations, kratom and 7-OH products are available at gas stations or online, sometimes without any age verification.

“Whenever you go into a gas station and even though it’s behind the glass, it’s kind of eye level, and it has all of these bright colors — it has all of these things that really attract the visual of a kiddo,” said Socorro Green, a prevention specialist with Youth180, a nonprofit focused on youth substance use prevention in Dallas.
Green added that kratom and 7-OH products may be even more accessible to young people in rural communities, where gas stations and convenience stores are often among the few available retailers.
Some researchers and experts say that certain products may not clearly or accurately disclose their 7-OH content and are sometimes marketed or mistaken for traditional kratom.
Some cities, counties and states have responded by banning kratom or raising the minimum purchase age to 18 or 21.
But in many areas, enforcement remains inconsistent, and some addiction specialists say clearer federal and state guidance is needed — especially as more people are using kratom and 7-OH to manage pain, anxiety or withdrawal symptoms on their own.
“There needs to be some kind of oversight, including some way of maybe helping to ensure that people know what they’re getting,” said Terrence Walton, the executive director and chief executive officer of NAADAC, the Association for Addiction Professionals.
 State regulations

At least seven states have considered or enacted legislation this year related to kratom — ranging from age restrictions and labeling requirements to outright bans.
In New York, lawmakers passed two bills: one requiring warning labels and prohibiting kratom products from being labeled as “all natural,” and another raising the minimum purchase age to 21. Neither has been sent to the governor.
In Colorado, a new measure, which was signed into law in May, prohibits kratom from being sold in forms that resemble candy or appeal to children, increases labeling requirements, limits concentrations of 7-OH, and bans the manufacture and distribution of synthetic or semi-synthetic kratom.
In Mississippi, a new law that took effect in July raised the minimum purchase age for kratom to 21. It also bans synthetic kratom extracts and products with high concentrations of 7-OH. Lawmakers in Montana and Texas introduced similar legislation this year, but neither proposal advanced.
Louisiana is the latest state to enact a kratom ban, which took effect Aug. 1. Meanwhile, in July, Rhode Island became the first state to reverse its ban. The new law establishes a regulatory framework for the manufacturing, sale and distribution of kratom products, set to take effect in April 2026.
As of this year, Washington, D.C., and seven states — Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Louisiana, Rhode Island (until April 2026), Vermont and Wisconsin — have banned kratom. At least half of U.S. states now regulate kratom or its components in some way.

(Stew Milne for Alabama Reflector)U.S. Circuit Judge Stanley Marcus recently asked attorneys for Alabama a direct question: Why should we ignore the past?
This happened during a hearing on Alabama’s congressional district maps. Marcus and his two colleagues — U.S. district judges Anna Manasco and Terry Moorer, both Trump appointees — ruled in May that the state discriminated against Black voters by approving a 2023 map that gave those Alabamians little chance of electing their preferred leaders.
As the court considered sanctions, Alabama Solicitor General Edmund LaCour argued that the judges could only impose preclearance, or judicial review of future congressional maps, if they found numerous violations of the 14th and 15th amendments, which address congressional representation and voting rights. The Legislature’s actions in 2023, LaCour said, were unlike the “unremitting and ingenious defiance that made it nearly impossible for Black voters in the South to register to vote.”
“I hear you that to a certain extent, states should be given some ability to be viewed as actors with clean hands,” Marcus replied. “But the state of Alabama shouldn’t be divorced from its history, should it?”
I can answer that. No. A thousand times no.
Look at the history of Alabama from 1901 to 2025. You can’t find any example of Alabama officials helping or even allowing Black Alabamians to vote without federal or judicial intervention. Left to their own devices, they put up obstacles. And worse.
Our state government exists to let powerful elites act without restraint. Alabama leaders have spent over a century demanding that same level of deference from the federal government, the only force that ever made our leaders pay attention to citizens outside the country clubs.
And in that quest, the elites have had a powerful ally: the U.S. Supreme Court.
In 1903, Black Alabamians presented the nation’s high court with transcripts of Alabama’s 1901 constitutional convention, in which leaders said without caveat or dissembling that they planned to disenfranchise Black voters and defy the spirit of the Reconstruction amendments. In the face of this tyranny, the justices claimed they had no power to enforce the U.S. Constitution. At least as applied to Black Americans.
Sure, there were 15 years where the Warren Court acted responsibly. The justices upheld the Voting Rights Act in 1966 in the face of a lawsuit from South Carolina (in which Alabama officials filed a brief on behalf of the Palmetto State).
But that was the eye of the hurricane.
In 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, which required the U.S. Department of Justice to approve any voting law changes made by Alabama and other states with long histories of racial discrimination. That’s preclearance. Chief Justice John Roberts, siding with a group of Shelby County plaintiffs who challenged the law, wrote that the country “had changed.”
In the next decade, Alabama lawmakers made Roberts look like a sucker or a conspirator. Since the 2013 decision, Alabama has banned drop boxes used by voters with disabilities and criminalized some forms of absentee ballot assistance.
And look at the last two years. Marcus, Manasco and Moorer ordered the Legislature in 2023 to draw two districts where Black voters had an opportunity to elect their preferred leaders. The Legislature responded with a nonresponsive map. And that, as Alabama House Speaker Nathaniel Ledbetter, R-Rainsville, said at the time, was deliberate. They intended to ignore the lower court and win an appeal at the U.S. Supreme Court.
The state lost that time. Last week, the court ordered the state to keep the current congressional map in place through the 2030 Census.
But the nation’s highest court now appears ready to ride to our leaders’ rescue.
The justices earlier this month ordered the parties in a Louisiana redistricting case to brief them on whether majority-minority districts violate the 14th and 15th amendments.
This is a bad sign for Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, the last shred of the law remaining. Section 2 bans voting laws that discriminate based on race. It was critical in Alabama’s redistricting case. The lower court judges ruled that since Alabama voting is racially polarized — with white Alabamians tending to support Republicans and Black Alabamians tending to support Democrats — the Legislature’s preferred map swamped Black voters and didn’t give them an actual voice in the political process. Hence, the two districts.
Declare those unconstitutional, and Black Alabama voices in Congress will be silenced. The Republicans who control our government will not hesitate to draw seats to ensure our delegation is all GOP and all-white.
What would stop them?
This is not a government that works for its people. This is a regime that protects the privilege of the powerful. It sees popular opinion as a threat to be siphoned off or contained. Left to their own devices, Alabama officials will always make it difficult for Alabamians to govern themselves.
And sadly, you don’t have to go very far back in the past to find examples of that.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Friday_maps_20-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-08-11 08:57:43.423165

The declines continue a trend seen since crime surged during the COVID-19 pandemic, when homicides jumped nearly 30% in 2020 — one of the largest one-year increases since the FBI began keeping records in 1930. By 2022, violent crime had fallen close to pre-pandemic levels.
Homicides, which the FBI classifies as murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, dropped nearly 15% in 2024. Reports of other violent offenses also decreased, including rape by 5.2%, robbery by 8.9% and aggravated assault by 3%.

Property crime also fell across all major categories, with motor vehicle theft down 18.6%, burglary down 8.6% and larceny-theft down 5.5%. Reported hate crimes decreased 1.5% from the previous year.

The 2024 report draws on submissions from 16,675 law enforcement agencies — 2.1% more than last year — representing more than 95% of the U.S. population. Every city agency serving a population of 1 million or more people provided a full year of data. Participation in the FBI’s crime data collection is voluntary, and the data is based on crimes reported to police.
About 75% of participating agencies submitted information through the FBI’s new, more detailed National Incident-Based Reporting System, or NIBRS, which covered 87% of the population.
The data release marks a shift from recent years when participation lagged following the FBI’s 2021 transition to the new system, which required many law enforcement agencies to invest in training and technology upgrades. In 2021, national reporting rates fell below 70% for the first time in two decades, forcing the FBI to estimate results for many jurisdictions.
The FBI’s crime trends report also includes new law enforcement safety data. Sixty-four officers were feloniously killed in the line of duty in 2024, 43 officers were accidentally killed and 85,730 officers were assaulted.
Although the FBI’s 2024 report is a year behind, it aligns with other crime trend reports. The Council on Criminal Justice, a nonpartisan think tank, recently found that homicides and other serious offenses, including gun assaults and carjackings, fell in the first half of 2025 across 42 major cities compared to the same period in 2024.

(Amanda Hernández/Stateline)For years, state lawmakers have taken the lead on regulating kratom — the controversial herbal supplement used for pain relief, anxiety and opioid withdrawal symptoms. Some states have banned it entirely. Others have passed laws requiring age limits, labeling and lab testing.
At least half of the states and the District of Columbia have enacted some form of regulation on kratom or its components — building a patchwork of policies around a product largely unaddressed by the federal government.
But that may soon change. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is pushing to ban 7-hydroxymitragynine, or 7-OH — a powerful compound found in small amounts in kratom and sometimes concentrated or synthesized in products sold online, at smoke shops or behind gas station counters.
Federal health officials announced last month that the compound poses serious public health risks and should be classified as a Schedule I controlled substance, alongside heroin and LSD.
The move marks a significant shift in how federal regulators are approaching kratom, which they attempted to ban in 2016. It also has sparked debate about how the change could impact the growing 7-OH industry and its consumers.
This year, at least seven states have considered bills to tighten kratom regulations, including proposals for bans, age restrictions and labeling requirements.
Kratom, which originates from the leaves of a tree native to Southeast Asia, can have a wide range of mental and bodily effects, according to federal officials, addiction medicine specialists and kratom researchers. Reports of fatal kratom overdoses have surfaced in recent years, though kratom is often taken in combination with other substances.
Kratom and 7-OH are distinct products with separate markets, but they are closely connected. 7-OH is a semi-synthetic compound derived from kratom and only emerged on the market in late 2023, while kratom itself has been available for decades.
Leading kratom researchers also say more research is needed to fully understand the long-term effects of using both substances.
“There’s much we don’t know, unfortunately, on all sides,” said Christopher R. McCurdy, a professor of medicinal chemistry at the University of Florida. McCurdy is a trained pharmacist and has studied kratom for more than 20 years.
Research suggests kratom may help with opioid withdrawal and doesn’t seem to cause severe withdrawal on its own. Smaller amounts seem to act as a stimulant, while larger doses may have sedative, opioidlike effects. Very little is known about the risks of long-term use in humans, according to McCurdy.
As for 7-OH, it shows potential for treating pain, but it hasn’t been studied in humans, and it may carry a high risk of addiction. Researchers don’t yet understand how much is safe to take or how often it should be used, McCurdy told Stateline.
While some leading kratom experts agree that kratom and 7-OH should be regulated, they caution that placing 7-OH under a strict Schedule I classification would make it much harder to study — and argue it should instead be classified as Schedule II like some other opioids.
A federal survey from 2023 estimated that about 1.6 million Americans age 12 and older used kratom in the year before the study. The American Kratom Association, a national industry lobbying group, estimated in 2021 that between 11 million and 16 million Americans safely consume kratom products each year.
Since gaining popularity in recent years, 7-OH has appeared in a growing number of products. Some researchers and addiction medicine specialists say many consumers, especially those new to kratom, sometimes don’t understand the difference between products.
“It’s a pure opioid that’s available without a prescription, so it’s akin to having morphine or oxycodone for sale at a smoke shop or a gas station,” McCurdy said. “This is a public health crisis waiting to happen.”
Federal crackdown targets 7-OH, not kratom
In late July, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommended that the federal Drug Enforcement Administration place 7-OH in Schedule I, citing a high potential for abuse. The classification would not apply to kratom leaves or powders with naturally occurring 7-OH.
“We’re not targeting the kratom leaf or ground-up kratom,” FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said at a news conference. “We are targeting a concentrated synthetic byproduct that is an opioid.”
Makary acknowledged that there isn’t enough research or data to fully understand how widespread 7-OH’s use or impact may be. Still, he said the Trump administration wants to be “aggressive and proactive” in addressing the issue before it grows into a larger public health problem.
States stiffen penalties for fentanyl, despite public health concerns

While only small amounts of 7-OH occur naturally in the kratom plant, federal officials have raised concerns about U.S. products containing synthetic or concentrated forms of the compound because it’s more potent than morphine and primarily responsible for kratom’s opioidlike effects.
The FDA’s recommendation to schedule 7-OH will now go to the DEA, which oversees the final steps of the process — including issuing a formal proposal and opening a public comment period.
If finalized, the rule could affect both companies selling enhanced kratom products and consumers in states where those products are currently legal.
The DEA backed off scheduling kratom compounds in 2016 after widespread public opposition.
Kirsten Smith, an assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Johns Hopkins University who is studying kratom’s effects in humans, said she was surprised by the FDA’s push to schedule 7-OH.
“We don’t really have a public health signal of a lot of adverse events for either kratom or for 7-OH at this time,” she told Stateline. “I was, frankly, always surprised that kratom was pushed toward scheduling at an earlier time point. … I don’t know that we have data to support scheduling even now.”
Still, some advocacy groups, including the Holistic Alternative Recovery Trust, argue the push to schedule 7-OH is driven more by corporate interests than public health, suggesting the kratom industry is trying to sideline competition from 7-OH products.
“We think that this is just happening because of the legacy kratom manufacturers losing market share and wanting to gin up a crisis with this,” said Jeff Smith, the national policy director for the group, who said he has used 7-OH for sleep and pain management.
While his organization supports regulation and safe consumption, members worry the federal government’s move could drive people to riskier substances or push the market underground.
“It’s made a profound difference in my life,” Smith said. “We think it would be tragic to cut it off based on such a paucity of data when there’s so much potential for this product to help people.”
Public health concerns
Federal health officials say a key concern is the growing use of kratom and 7-OH products among teens and young adults.
Some officials and addiction medicine specialists have pointed out that these products often come in flavors and packaging designed to appeal to younger buyers, with few controls over where or how they’re sold. In some states without clear regulations, kratom and 7-OH products are available at gas stations or online, sometimes without any age verification.

“Whenever you go into a gas station and even though it’s behind the glass, it’s kind of eye level, and it has all of these bright colors — it has all of these things that really attract the visual of a kiddo,” said Socorro Green, a prevention specialist with Youth180, a nonprofit focused on youth substance use prevention in Dallas.
Green added that kratom and 7-OH products may be even more accessible to young people in rural communities, where gas stations and convenience stores are often among the few available retailers.
Some researchers and experts say that certain products may not clearly or accurately disclose their 7-OH content and are sometimes marketed or mistaken for traditional kratom.
As Kratom Use Surges, Some States Enact Bans

Some cities, counties and states have responded by banning kratom or raising the minimum purchase age to 18 or 21. But in many areas, enforcement remains inconsistent, and some addiction specialists say clearer federal and state guidance is needed — especially as more people are using kratom and 7-OH to manage pain, anxiety or withdrawal symptoms on their own.
“There needs to be some kind of oversight, including some way of maybe helping to ensure that people know what they’re getting,” said Terrence Walton, the executive director and chief executive officer of NAADAC, the Association for Addiction Professionals.
State regulations
At least seven states have considered or enacted legislation this year related to kratom — ranging from age restrictions and labeling requirements to outright bans.
In New York, lawmakers passed two bills: one requiring warning labels and prohibiting kratom products from being labeled as “all natural,” and another raising the minimum purchase age to 21. Neither has been sent to the governor.
In Colorado, a new measure, which was signed into law in May, prohibits kratom from being sold in forms that resemble candy or appeal to children, increases labeling requirements, limits concentrations of 7-OH, and bans the manufacture and distribution of synthetic or semi-synthetic kratom.
In Mississippi, a new law that took effect in July raised the minimum purchase age for kratom to 21. It also bans synthetic kratom extracts and products with high concentrations of 7-OH. Lawmakers in Montana and Texas introduced similar legislation this year, but neither proposal advanced.
Louisiana is the latest state to enact a kratom ban, which took effect Aug. 1. Meanwhile, in July, Rhode Island became the first state to reverse its ban. The new law establishes a regulatory framework for the manufacturing, sale and distribution of kratom products, set to take effect in April 2026.
As of this year, Washington, D.C., and seven states — Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Louisiana, Rhode Island (until April 2026), Vermont and Wisconsin — have banned kratom. At least half of U.S. states now regulate kratom or its components in some way.

Progressives and voting rights advocates are divided on whether California and New York should fight the Texas power grab by gerrymandering their own states, creating more safe Democratic seats, even if that means undermining fair maps and the authority of those states’ nonpartisan redistricting commissions.
In Wisconsin, which just got out from under one of the worst partisan gerrymanders in the U.S., and the impenetrable, outsized Republican majorities in the state Legislature it protected for a decade and a half, this issue hits particularly close to home.
It’s head-spinning to hear arguments for Democratic counter-gerrymandering in other states from the same people in Wisconsin who were recently crying out for fair maps.
If Democrats are going to mount a serious challenge to the fascist takeover of our country by Trump and his minions, it’s hard to see how ceding the moral high ground and running roughshod over the principle that the will of the majority of voters should prevail is going to help.
I get that it’s more satisfying to imagine a quick fix to the fascist takeover of every branch of government than to listen to a lot of vague talk about long-term plans to rebuild democracy. After all, election deniers and the architects of the Jan. 6 attack are now running the federal government, demanding access to voter lists across the country and deploying the FBI to arrest political opponents, including the Texas Democrats who’ve fled their state to stall the gerrymandering scheme there.
But here in Wisconsin, where we’ve just finally beaten back the most gerrymandered map in the country, it’s depressing to imagine Democrats abandoning the high ground and scrambling to do exactly what Republicans did when they controlled all three branches of government, attempting to lock in permanent political control against the will of the people.
If we want democracy, fairness, and the rule of law, we need to champion, well, democracy, fairness and the rule of law.
In this most extreme political moment, with every public institution and the continued existence of U.S. democracy in doubt, I understand why the long view frustrates people. The emergency is now. I understand that many voters want to see Democrats “fight fire with fire,” as Newsom put it.
But consider this: Republicans control more state legislatures (28 Republican versus 18 controlled by Democrats) and have trifecta control of all branches of government in more states (23 all-GOP states versus 15 all-Democratic). JD Vance just launched a tour of Republican states to encourage more mid-decade gerrymandering. And Trump wants to hold a new census for the purpose of redefining who can vote. Even if Democratic Govs. Gavin Newsom and Kathy Hochul succeed in gerrymandering California and New York, Democrats are not likely to win the nationwide redistricting war.
Meanwhile, democracy will be the first casualty of that war. California and New York would have to suspend the work of their nonpartisan redistricting commissions — the gold standard for fair, nonpartisan map-drawing — and take back partisan control of the process in order to carry out their threats. If they succeed, it is beyond unlikely that the politicians who pull off that short-term victory will ever cede back their power over the voting maps to the nonpartisan commissions again.
On a deeper level, the Democratic gerrymandering fantasy takes the whole movement to oppose Trump in exactly the wrong direction. Instead of building grassroots support to counter an unpopular, authoritarian leader, it rigs the system to benefit a party whose whole problem is that it has lost the broad, popular support it needs to win elections and create a better, more enlightened government.
Instead of trying to rig the maps to ensure a Democratic House majority in the next election, Democrats need to focus on winning elections and flipping seats in areas of the rural and industrial Midwest that were once reliably blue but have turned deep red.
To do that they need to make the case that health care, education and an adequate social safety net are bedrock rights in the richest nation on earth, and that we should not be giving tax breaks to billionaires by taking food out of the mouths of hungry children.
They need to offer something to the farmers and factory workers and disaffected voters in rural and urban areas alike that is clearly different and better than the hate, corruption, and a determination to run roughshod over democracy that Republicans offer.
In Wisconsin, voting rights groups have been working on a campaign to push through a constitutional amendment modeled on one in our neighboring state of Michigan, to make sure that our voting maps are never again drawn up by partisan legislators.
That’s the kind of grassroots fight that helped Wisconsin finally overcome Republican gerrymandering. One important aspect of the fair maps movement is the way it engaged citizens to feel like participants, not spectators, in democracy, and to find their common interests instead of focusing on the politics of division. This, not more politicians in safe seats who don’t have to listen to voters, is what we need right now.
The battle to beat back fascism does not turn on a handful of Democrats in protected districts. It turns on an organized uprising by the majority of people in the U.S. who are willing to join together despite their differences because they are sick and tired of having their democracy stolen from them, along with their health, safety, opportunity and hope. There’s no short cut to leading that fight.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-11 11:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,What is diquat? Here’s what to know about herbicide at the center of debate in CT,John Moritz and Angela Eichhorst,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/11/diquat-army-corps-hydrilla/,Diquat is among the most common herbicides used on invasive plants. It's approved for use in the US by the Environmental Protections Agency.,"Throughout this summer, a debate has raged along the Connecticut River over a little known but widely used chemical herbicide: diquat.
The controversy kicked off in June when the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announced its plans to resume using diquat and other herbicides to combat the spread of invasive hydrilla along the river. Those plans were part of a years-long effort to study the effectiveness of using herbicides to control hydrilla. They quickly became the subject of viral social media posts. 
Here’s what to know about the herbicide, the Army Corps’ plans, and risks to the public:
What is diquat?
Diquat, or diquat dibromide, is a chemical herbicide that was first developed in England in the 1950s for use in agriculture. Diquat is a fast-acting, non-selective herbicide, meaning it can be used against a wide range of weeds, invasive plants and other target species.
Dr. Melissa Perry, dean of the College of Public Health at George Mason University, said diquat can be used as a “burndown” herbicide that is applied to soils before crops are planted in order to control weeds. In agriculture, it is most commonly used in growing potatoes, oil seed crops and vineyards, though Perry said diquat remains relatively rare for use on U.S. farms.
While it is known to persist in soils for a long time, diquat dissipates quickly in water — making it much more popular as an aquatic herbicide.
Despite some claims that have circulated online, Perry said that diquat is not related to Agent Orange, another herbicide that became infamous for its use by U.S. troops during the Vietnam War.
How is it being used in Connecticut?
In Connecticut, diquat is among the most common herbicides used to rid lakes and ponds of invasive plants such as hydrilla, water chestnut and Eurasian watermilfoil.
A total of 955 permits have been issued since 2022 allowing for the use of diquat in aquatic settings. 
The chemical works by destroying walls of plant cells from within and interrupting the photosynthesis process. Diquat is known to be especially effective against plants with weak root systems, like hydrilla, and is not as lethal to plants with stronger roots.
Typically, the herbicide is either sprayed at the surface level or it is mixed into a sinking solution that is injected under the water through hoses. The latter method is the one that the Army Corps of Engineers have employed as part of their ongoing studies on the Connecticut River.
That work began in 2023, when research scientists began placing dyes into the river to study its flow in order to determine what herbicides to use, in different concentrations, in areas afflicted by hydrilla. Based on those results, the Army Corps first started applying herbicides, including diquat, at five areas along the river last summer.
The Army Corps has recorded large declines in the amount of invasive hydrilla, with minimal impacts to native plants, as a result of that application. This summer, the hydrilla has returned in Chester Boat Basin and, to a larger extent, in Selden Cove, according to the Corps’ reports. Both sites were selected for additional treatments when the Corps’ resumes its studies this month.
What are the risks?
According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the potential health risks from diquat are mostly associated with people who work with the chemical or apply it to their lawns and gardens.
The agency does not report any dietary or other post-application risks associated with exposure to treated water.
“The bottom line is, if the labeled directions are being followed, there are no concerns from people swimming or coming into contact with water that’s been treated with diquat,” said Anne Overstreet, the director of the EPA’s Pesticide Re-Evaluation Division.
Overstreet said that the agency has determined that diquat can be “mildly toxic” to fish and other aquatic wildlife that are not the intended targets of its treatment. Reports released by the agency said those effects can be mitigated by applying the herbicide underneath the water, as opposed to spraying it on the surface where it can more easily drift into other areas.
Due to the potential risk to people who handle diquat in undiluted concentrations, the EPA requires certain workers to wear protective clothing, including respirators and protective eyewear. 
Perry, the epidemiologist, said skin exposure can be toxic and ingesting diquat is “highly toxic,” interfering with the gut, its microbiome and other internal organs.
How is it regulated?
Diquat and other herbicides are approved for use in the U.S. by the EPA. The agency completed its most recent review of diquat in 2020, allowing its continued use in a variety of applications including lakes and waterways.
Diquat is also commercially available as an ingredient in several household landscaping products.
Critics of the Army Corps’ plans have frequently pointed out that diquat is banned in the European Union and the United Kingdom. Diquat lost its registration status in the E.U. in 2019, but it has been approved for emergency use dozens of times since, including in Ireland, Denmark and Hungary.
EPA is in charge of approving herbicides for the wider market, but Connecticut DEEP reviews and approves any requests to apply diquat or other chemicals within the state’s waterways. As part of its approval process, DEEP requires users post signs letting people know when it’s safe to swim, fish or use the water for irrigation purposes.
What are the alternatives?
Other methods for combating invasive aquatic plants include the use of mechanical harvesters or large mats to block sunlight, preventing plants from growing.
Due to the costs and inability to target specific plants without also impacting large numbers of native species, Army Corps officials determined that neither option was suitable for use along the Connecticut River.
In 2017, voters in New Fairfield adopted an ordinance to prevent officials from using diquat and other herbicides to combat a similar infestation of invasive weeds on Candlewood Lake. As an alternative to using herbicides, the Candlewood Lake Authority began introducing sterile grass carp to feed on watermilfoil and other weeds. Between 2015 and 2017, more than 8,000 carp were stocked into the lake.
Those actions effectively controlled excess vegetation, Mark Howarth, the CLA’s executive director, said in an email. But in 2022, “there was a big shift in the lake and virtually all of the vegetation was eliminated,” including native species, Howarth said. The die-off was attributed to both the voracious carp and the annual lowering of water levels by the lake’s owner, FirstLight Energy. As as result, DEEP has been working to remove the carp from the lake until the vegetation can recover.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/5345047.jpg,,,2025-08-11 07:57:11.236088

They came with promises of transformation: thousands of jobs, surging salaries and a foothold in the booming electric vehicle market.
Imola Automotive USA, a Boca Raton, Florida-based startup, pitched officials in small, struggling towns in Georgia, Oklahoma and Arkansas on a bold vision. The company planned to build six EV plants, create 45,000 jobs —  and help these impoverished communities secure a place in America’s green future.
But more than 18 months later, the company hasn’t broken ground on a single site. And its top executive — whose background is in television and athletic shoes, not automotive manufacturing — has gone silent.
A Floodlight investigation did not uncover lost taxpayer money in Fort Valley, Georgia; Langston, Oklahoma; or Pine Bluff, Arkansas, where Imola has sought free land, municipal financing and other incentives for its shifting proposals. 
But an economic development watchdog said the episode illustrates how the frenzy to land electric vehicle jobs can leave economically distressed towns vulnerable to empty promises.

(Kenneth C. Zirkel via Wikimedia)
Imola CEO Rodney Henry declined requests for an interview. He responded to Floodlight’s inquiries with a short statement, insisting the company had not given up on its plans, which have included a partnership with an Italian manufacturer of two-seat electric vehicles. 
“Our timetable has been modified due to matters outside of our control,” Henry said in a statement. “We are highly focused on bringing our goals into alignment. Due to proprietary consideration as well as NDA (nondisclosure) agreements, we are not at liberty to discuss specifics at this juncture.”
That’s a stark shift from the company’s earlier promises. In a press release issued in January 2024, Henry claimed the company had already secured land in multiple states to build half a dozen plants and create tens of thousands of jobs. 
Could someone with no experience in car manufacturing really deliver that?
“It’s ludicrous,” said Greg LeRoy, CEO of Good Jobs First, a nonprofit that tracks and analyzes economic development projects. 
Building large auto plants, he said, requires “a great deal of capital, a great deal of management skill, a great deal of engineering and marketing chops. And obviously, Tesla developed those, but they didn’t do it overnight, right?”
Langston, Fort Valley and Pine Bluff weren’t the only towns swept up in the competition to attract electric vehicle plants. Spurred by federal policies like the Inflation Reduction Act, which unlocked billions in private investment and expanded government incentives, local officials across the country scrambled to land high-paying manufacturing jobs and a slice of the booming clean energy economy.
Since the IRA passed in 2022, more than 150 EV plants have been announced in the United States, according to E2, a nonpartisan group of business leaders who advocate for economic development good for the environment.
But that rush may be grinding to a halt. The recently passed “One Big Beautiful Bill” rolls back many federal tax credits and incentives for electric vehicles. The law is already throwing the EV sector into turmoil — threatening to stall or shrink the kinds of ambitious projects towns like Langston, Fort Valley and Pine Bluff were counting on. E2 reports that plans for 14 EV-related plants have been canceled this year.
  Imola Automotive USA President Rodney Henry said in early 2024 that his company had chosen Langston, Okla., and Pine Bluff, Ark., as sites for their electric vehicle plants because they were close to universities. That, he said, would create career opportunities for residents and students of Langston University, a historically Black college. The plans in Langston, however, have been canceled. (Website for Langston, Okla.)
Bold promises, then silence
In three towns where Imola pledged massive investment, there’s no sign of construction and little more than confusion.
Langston — a town of 1,600 where more than 35% of residents live in poverty — never saw Imola’s plans take shape.
A 2023 letter to the city council from former Imola chief operating officer Eric Pettus stated that the company had run into “multiple obstacles,” including trouble acquiring enough land.
“In order for us to continue moving forward on the project we are requesting that the City of Langston convey to us any and all vacant properties owned by the city,” Pettus wrote.
Langston City Council member Magnus Scott said the company also asked the town to issue municipal bonds to help them build their plant. Since then, he said, a company representative told him the deal had been canceled. 
“I guess maybe they ran into financial problems,” Scott said.
Reached by phone, Pettus, of south Florida, said he’s no longer employed by Imola but instead works as a consultant for the company. Citing a nondisclosure agreement, he declined to discuss Imola’s plans.
Fort Valley gave its backing in early 2024 to Imola’s ambitious plan to build an EV plant that would employ 7,500 workers.

Since then, however, there has been no sign of construction. (Fort Valley State University)
A year later, with no sign of progress on the plant, the company came back to the Georgia town with an entirely different proposal. This time, instead of building an EV plant, they pitched a high-tech lighting system for the town. 
One city council member balked.
“You want us to sign an agreement for 99 years before you bring us the car company,” said council member Laronda Eason, according to minutes of the March 2025 meeting. “It feels like a bait and switch.” 
Eason did not respond to emails and text messages seeking comment on the Imola proposal.
In Pine Bluff, where per capita income last year was just over $21,000, city officials were initially all in. Writing to Henry in August 2024, then-Mayor Shirley Washington said the city of 39,000 stood ready to buy land, build infrastructure and issue industrial revenue bonds to support Imola’s vision. 
“With an anticipated employment base of more than 8,000 jobs,” Washington wrote, “we firmly believe this investment will marshal a pivotal turning point in our community.” 
But a year later, the project hasn’t moved. 
“We never did get off the ground with that,” Washington said in a brief phone interview.
 LeRoy said Imola’s pitch fits a troubling pattern.
“It grabs me as an example of how the craze among governors and mayors to get the next big thing has caused some sloppy vetting,” he said of the struggling communities courted by Imola. 
Such towns, he said, are “easy prey. …They’re desperate.”

Grand vision, missing details
Henry, who lives in Florida, touts a background as a longtime TV executive producer and the founder of Protégé, an athletic footwear brand. He claims on his IMDB profile that Protégé donated a million pairs of shoes to African nations.
But despite announcements of partnerships and promises of good-paying jobs, his EV company has yet to show any tangible progress. 
Floodlight found the website for Imola — named after the Italian city where Tazzari EVs are made — is no longer accessible without a password. A search of the Tazzari website found no mention of plants in the United States. But a 2024 version of the Imola site mentions the tiny vehicles “coming soon to America.”
In early 2024, Imola Automotive USA and the Tazzari Group — an Italian firm best known for its electric two-seater micro cars — jointly announced plans for a partnership. 
The EVs that Tazzari makes in Italy aren’t designed for highway driving. Top speed on the company’s Opensky Sport model is about 56 miles per hour, while maximum speed on the Opensky Limited is about 37 mph, according to the company’s webpage.
  These are some of the electric two-seater micro cars made by the Tazzari Group. The Italian firm and Imola Automotive USA jointly announced plans for a partnership in early 2024 as Imola promised to build electric vehicle plants in economically struggling U.S. towns. There’s no sign of progress so far. (Tazzari Group’s website)
Tazzari didn’t respond to email messages from a Floodlight reporter.
Henry said at the time that the company chose Langston and Fort Valley because of their universities. 
“Both of these locations are ideal,” he said in the January 2024 news release, “as their proximity to communities with institutions of higher learning, will allow residents and students career opportunities in the fast growing EV Technology and Innovation Industry.” 
Many local officials in Fort Valley, Langston and Pine Bluff did not respond to interview requests. Few documents were provided in response to Floodlight’s public records requests.
But it’s clear from available records that Imola’s promises stirred hope. 
Langston Mayor Michael Boyles called the proposal “transformative” in a January 2024 news release.
But some local leaders soon began to question the details.
Erica Johnson, a real estate agent and former member of Langston’s economic development commission, said parts of the plan didn’t add up. How, for instance, would the company house more than 1,000 workers in such a small town? And how were they going to build such a large plant on land without utilities or water?
Her doubts deepened when she learned that Imola wanted to lock down land agreements without putting up any earnest money.
“My early feeling was that, ‘Something is not quite okay with this,’ ” she said. “But I think the hope for our community kind of outweighed the ability to just take things slow and look at them for where they are and what they are — versus where you hope them to be.”
Eventually, the promise fizzled. 
“It was disappointing,” Johnson said. “…We could have had our energy and time focused on something that seemed more valid and more substantial.”
  In early 2024, Imola Automotive USA promised that it would build an electric vehicle plant in Fort Valley, Ga., that would employ 7,500 people — and pay average wages of $45 an hour. The promises have raised hopes in the economically struggling town, but there’s little indication they will be fulfilled. (Michael Rivera via Wikimedia)
Still waiting for the shovels
Some residents in Fort Valley are still holding out hope.
Mayor Jeffery Lundy said early last year that it was a “priority for my administration to land a company like Imola Automotive USA.” Local officials, he said, were looking forward to the economic boost the plant would bring.
At the time, Imola claimed it would break ground on a 195-acre site by the third quarter of 2024 and open the plant within 20 months, according to a report in the Macon Telegraph. 
During a February 2024 town hall meeting, Imola officials told residents that the plant would pay employees an average of $45 an hour, according to a Facebook post. Commenters buzzed with excitement, with one writing: “Application me !!!!” 
Pettus told a local TV station that most jobs would require only a high school diploma.
In early 2024, Fort Valley rezoned land to accommodate the plant, and the city council signed off on the deal. But more than 15 months later, there’s still no sign of construction. 
Council members were told that Georgia Power couldn’t provide sufficient power for the EV company, according to minutes of their March 2025 meeting. A spokesman for Georgia Power said that while the utility doesn’t discuss economic development projects, “We’re prepared and ready to meet the energy needs of any new customer.” 
Makita Driver, one of the Facebook commenters who’d voiced excitement about the proposed EV plant, said there’s no doubt she would have applied for one of the jobs there — had the facility ever been built.
“The pay rate was really what got my attention,” she said.
As a medical assistant, Driver said she earns far less than what Imola had promised. But she eventually concluded the promises were too good to be true.
“Who really makes that kind of money starting out?” she asked.
In a brief interview with Floodlight on July 11, Mayor Lundy said he’s still in contact with Henry.
“We are patiently waiting for that groundbreaking,” Lundy said.

(Photo courtesy of Iowa PBS)Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird led a multistate letter Friday questioning whether a new net-zero carbon emissions standard for businesses is illegal under state and federal law.
The letter was sent to David Kennedy, CEO of the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), a group that recently released its Financial Institutions Net-Zero standard.
This standard is meant to aid financial institutions “in addressing their most significant climate impact through alignment and sector-specific targets,” according to the document, through actions like stopping or limiting investments in new projects related to fossil fuel expansion and addressing deforestation risks in existing investments.
This standard could run afoul of state and federal laws limiting ESG investment strategies — practices where investment firms account for “environmental, social and governance factors” when making investments, according to Bird’s letter.
According to the law firm Morgan Lewis, there were 20 states with “anti-ESG” rules in effect as of September 2023.
South Carolina joined the list in February 2024, when Gov. Henry McMaster signed the ESG Pension Protection Act.
Bird also wrote SBTi and the businesses that commit to following the standard may be in violation of state consumer protection laws and federal and state antitrust laws, constituting an illegal boycott by deliberately cutting off investment and insurance for certain industries through their standard on oil, gas, and coal expansion.
“Some economic arrangements are illegal because they are unfair or unreasonably harmful to competition; the ‘good intentions’ behind them are irrelevant,” Bird wrote.
The letter was co-signed by attorneys general from 22 other states — Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wyoming.
It included a list of requested information and documents from SBTi on its communication with members about how it plans to meet net-zero carbon emission commitments, how the standard was developed, and how it is working with insurance companies to reduce emissions.
In a news release Friday, Bird called the standard from SBTi, which partners with the United Nations, the World Wide Fund for Nature and other organizations in providing advisory information, “the next attempt by radical environmentalists to coordinate companies to squeeze important American industries into eliminating carbon dioxide production by some future date.”
“SBTi is trying to redo President Biden’s radical green scheme,” Bird said in a statement. “If successful, they’ll hurt farmers, energy producers, and Iowans. Its program limits output of goods or services, and these unrealistic net-zero programs harm both American agriculture and industry. Making net-zero a goal actively harms Americans, creates risk for energy independence, and increases the cost of safe, healthy, nutritious food.”
Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier also took steps to investigate SBTi last week, announcing he would issue subpoenas to the advisory group and the CDP, an international nonprofit focused on environmental impact reporting.
The investigation will look into whether these organizations violated state consumer protection and antitrust laws “by coercing companies into disclosing proprietary data and paying for access under the guise of environmental transparency,” according to a news release.
“Radical climate activists have hijacked corporate governance and weaponized it against the free market,” Uthmeier said in a statement. “Florida will not sit back while international pressure groups shake down American companies to fund their ESG grift. We’re using every tool of the law to stop the Climate Cartel from exploiting businesses and misleading consumers.”
South Carolina’s anti-ESG law requires the Retirement System Investment Commission to make investment decisions based only on “pecuniary factors” — in other words, what’s expected to net the most money — without giving weight to policies such as climate change and social impacts. During a public hearing, the commission’s CEO told legislators nothing would change, since the agency already operated that way.

(Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)From 8% to 100%, the Indiana Chamber of Commerce recently graded Indiana lawmakers on their support of major business legislation in the recent General Assembly session.
The 41st annual Legislator Scorecard was based on how legislators voted on 12 key “pro-economy, pro-jobs” policies. The most significant of the bills was Senate Bill 1, which reduced property taxes — including a break for businesses.
Other key bills included the topics of road funding, education deregulation, economic development, child care, energy generation, higher education and workforce development and health care costs.
“The Legislator Scorecard is a critical measure to track lawmakers’ commitment to keeping our state among the nation’s best for doing business – which also leads to increased economic growth and job opportunities,” said Indiana Chamber President and CEO Vanessa Green Sinders. “The legislation that factored into the 2025 rankings was especially important in creating a more attractive tax climate, building our talent pipeline and maintaining needed road infrastructure.”
More than 50 lawmakers earned a perfect mark — all Republicans who generally align with the right-leaning Chamber of Commerce.
Many Republicans were in the 90 percentile, including Fort Wayne Sen. Liz Brown who scored 91%. Her four-year average is 89%. She has recently been targeted as being too liberal and faces a primary fight in 2026 against Allen County school board member Darren Vogt. He is backed by Republican U.S. Sen. Jim Banks.
There were a number of Republicans below 80%. They include Rep. Craig Haggard at 62%; Rep. Matt Hostettler at 75%; Rep. Andrew Ireland at 50%; Rep. Lorissa Sweet at 70%; Rep. Ethan Manning at 75%; Sen. Eric Bassler at 64%; Sen. Vaneta Becker at 42%; Sen. Gary Byrne at 62%; Sen. Spencer Deery at 69%; Sen. Dan Dernulc at 54%; Sen. Aaron Freeman at 54%; Sen. Tyler Johnson at 62%; Sen. Jean Leising; Sen. Jim Tomes at 46%; Sen. Michael Young at 42% and Sen. Andy Zay at 38%.
Some common bills that cost these lawmakers were ‘no’ votes on road funding and property tax relief.
The lower scores largely were assigned to Democrats, though the worst grade went to GOP Indianapolis Sen. Mike Bohacek.
Other awards
Seven policymakers also were further selected as an Indiana Chamber Legislative Champion, Small Business Champion or Champion Freshman Legislator.
The Legislative Champions are Rep. Jim Pressel, R-Rolling Prairie, and Rep. Jake Teshka, R-North Liberty, for their respective work on pro-business legislation in 2025, namely on the topics of road funding and taxation, respectively.
Additionally, three Small Business Champions were named: Rep. Martin Carbaugh, R-Fort Wayne; Rep. Chris Jeter, R-Fishers;  and Rep. Craig Snow, R-Warsaw.
The Indiana Chamber also honored Rep. Wendy Dant Chesser, D-Jeffersonville, and Rep. Danny Lopez, R-Carmel, as Champion Freshman Legislators for their impacts on boosting entrepreneurship and economic development.
The Legislator Scorecard (formerly Legislative Vote Analysis) is produced annually after the legislative session, the news released said. Lawmakers are kept apprised of the Indiana Chamber position and reasoning on these bills through various communications during the legislative session – and prior to key votes being taken. Only floor votes for which there is a public record are used in the vote calculations.

Holly McCall,,,,,https://tennesseelookout.com/2025/08/11/editors-notebook-lees-tunnel-vision-on-musk-project-again-fails-to-benefit-tennesseans/,"Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee was all smiles on July 28 as he announced the Boring Company, owned by billionaire Elon Musk, has plans to build a 10-mile tunnel connecting Nashville International Airport with downtown Nashville.

Bill Lee and U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announce a plan for Elon Musk's Boring Company to build an underground tunnel from the airport to Downtown Nashville. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee was all smiles on July 28 as he announced the Boring Company, owned by billionaire Elon Musk, has plans to build a 10-mile tunnel connecting Nashville International Airport with downtown Nashville.
The “Music City Loop,” as the project has been dubbed, will transport riders in electric vehicles, and if the project is anything like a similar Boring “Loop” in Las Vegas, the cars will all be Teslas, as Musk also owns Tesla. 
The company website says it creates tunnels to “solve the problem of soul destroying traffic,” and Lee said the project “will transform the way people travel from the airport to downtown Nashville.”
Aside from the Looney Tunes-Wile E. Coyote-sounding aspect of the project, the potential environmental impacts of boring through Middle Tennessee’s limestone — even Boring CEO Steve Davis admitted construction would be challenging —  and the company’s poor track record — it has managed to complete only one similar project, in Las Vegas, while projects in Illinois, Maryland, Florida and California have all been busts — there’s another topic on my mind. 
Hypocrisy, or, perhaps, lack thereof. 
My first thought was that Lee’s support for the project is hypocritical: After all, Tennessee’s Republican lawmakers have repeatedly over the last decade sneered at and stomped on efforts by Nashville leaders to enact mass transit plans geared toward alleviating the city’s growing traffic snarls while simultaneously stripping the city’s power.
Nashville, Tennessee voters green light transit tax

In 2012, Nashville Mayor Karl Dean pitched a plan for bus rapid transit (BRT), which allows buses to use dedicated lanes down the center of streets, expediting travel time: BRT is one of the simplest and most effective methods for expanding municipal transit. More than half of U.S. states implement BRT — including conservative states like Alabama, Florida and Texas.
The plan wasn’t perfect, but it was a starting point, aimed at connecting East and West Nashville. Nonetheless, it drew pushback from conservative political advocacy group Americans For Prosperity and subsequently from Tennessee Republicans. 
Former state Rep. Jeremy Durham, a Franklin Republican, crafted a measure in 2014 that would give the state the final say on any BRT project, whether state funds were used or not. Not only did that project, known as The Amp, die, but the law continues to impede Nashville’s transit plans: despite the city’s voters approving by a large margin a new tax to pay for transit improvements, city leaders will still need state approval to add transit on state roads. 
More recently, the GOP-legislature has enacted measure after preemptive measure designed to strip power from Nashville’s Metro Council and governing boards — including the Airport Authority and Convention Center Authority  — and to cut the size of Metro Council in half.
So, yes, supporting this boondoggle for billionaires and tourists may, at first glance, appear hypocritical based on past opposition to transit, but after thinking this over, I would argue that it’s 100% on brand for Lee and the state lawmakers who zoomed approval for a no-cost lease of state property to the Musk company. 
The Lee administration has failed to find solutions — or in some cases, even to try to find them — for issues important to Tennesseans. Since Lee was elected in 2018, he has raised no concern about the number of Tennesseans who lack health insurance. The Tennessee Justice Center, a nonprofit public advocacy organization, estimates about 300,000 people in the state aren’t covered by TennCare, the state’s Medicaid program, as lawmakers have refused to take a federal Medicaid expansion enacted in the Obama administration.
Gun safety? A nonstarter. After a 2023 school shooting, Lee held a special legislative session ostensibly devoted to creating safer laws around gun possession. Little was accomplished other than an agreement to apply $50 million to community mental health programs — a good start, but the funds were pulled from the already overburdened TennCare.
Then there’s the Department of Children’s Services. The state has been woefully slow to find solutions for the problem of having kids in state custody sleeping on the floor of office buildings. And although Lee has touted adoption as a solution to the number of children in foster care, Anita Wadhwani recently reported about a family who adopted a child with mental health needs, only to be thwarted in their attempts to find him help and threatened with child abandonment charges. 
Kids in state custody forced to sleep on floors in state office building

Finally, we have the Middle Tennessee issue of, yes, soul-destroying traffic. 
The area around Nashville is in dire need of mass transit to navigate the three interstates that run through the city. Commutes from Murfreesboro up the I-24 corridor during rush hour are legendary for bumper-to-bumper traffic. To get from Franklin to Nashville — around 18 miles — easily takes an hour. 
What does Lee give us? Toll lanes, couched as “choice lanes,” meaning you have the choice to pay extra money to travel in a less trafficked lane, and now this Musk-backed absurdity. 
Spare me the governor’s platitudes about how the Musk tunnel project will streamline traffic: I feel confident a tunnel for Teslas connecting the airport with downtown will offer little benefit to residents of Nashville and none to commuters who live in surrounding counties, but will put money in the pockets of people who least need it.
Another idea that doesn’t benefit Tennesseans? There’s no hypocrisy: That’s Lee to a tee.

They came to denounce the impact to patients, families and workers if Republicans cut Medicaid, health care and SNAP to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy. (Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images for SEIU)When we hear about health policy changes in the news, usually the numbers we hear are related to insurance: How many people will become insured or uninsured as a result of the latest legislation? Analysts — and as a result, news reporters, too — tend to use these numbers because they’re relatively simple to predict and understand.
But at the end of the day, health insurance is just a little card legally linked to a thick stack of paperwork in some office somewhere. Insurance numbers don’t really tell us much about what we actually want to know, which is the human health impact. How many medically avoidable deaths will a given piece of legislation prevent or cause? How many will or won’t get the care they need? How many more will or won’t be in medical debt?
Congress passed and on July 4 President Trump signed his “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” the largest ever cut to government health care funding in U.S. history. The Congressional Budget Office projects the law will push about 10 million Americans off of health insurance while growing the deficit by $3.4 trillion over the next decade.
Health economists have studied the link between health insurance and health outcomes and can estimate how many more preventable deaths Americans will suffer as health coverage declines, among other outcomes.
The Minnesota Department of Human Services recently released preliminary estimates that about 140,000 Minnesotans will lose their health insurance as a result of the legislation.
Additionally, due to upcoming subsidy expirations and rule changes for the Affordable Care Act’s insurance markets (“Obamacare”), health policy analysts at KFF have predicted an additional 5.1 million Americans will become uninsured nationwide, leading to an additional 13,000 uninsured Minnesotans.
Using this 153,000 figure, we can estimate that roughly one more Minnesotan will unnecessarily die per day as a result of losing coverage. Tens of thousands more will forego necessary care, miss medications, and rack up medical expenses they cannot afford.

Make no mistake, however. The craziest part of all of this should not be these figures themselves. It’s the fact that they can mostly still be prevented from coming to fruition by our state Legislature.
KFF estimates that the One Big Beautiful Bill Act is expected to cost the state up to $2.4 billion per year over the next decade, leaving a big hole for our state legislators to fill. Although some of these harms are caused by Congress’s imposition of work requirement paperwork burdens on Medicaid beneficiaries that the state cannot do much about, most of them come from the funding cuts, and funding cuts are something the state can definitely do something about. Minnesota just needs to come up with roughly $2.4 billion on its own.
How exactly can the state find such a large sum of money — roughly 6% of the state general fund budget? Believe it or not, it’s not actually that complicated. Currently, the state runs Medicaid through private third-party administrators called managed care organizations, or MCOs. These MCOs are a product of the 1990s, when the public policy world thought the problem with health care was that people were using too much of it, and health care needed gatekeepers.
It’s a rather evidence-free claim. Consider that Americans actually use less care than people in Europe and Canada despite spending far more per capita than them, all while also living shorter, less healthy lives. Nonetheless, the MCOs still run Minnesota’s Medicaid program, adding significant administrative expenses onto the state budget while doing nothing to make health care better.
Connecticut got rid of these wasteful MCO contractors in 2012, instead opting to run its Medicaid program itself. Unsurprisingly, they saved lots of money doing so. How much would Minnesota save if it spent per beneficiary what Connecticut does on Medicaid? About $1.5 billion annually, according to my analysis.
Given the $2.4 billion in cuts also includes some money cut from non-health care areas, that $1.5 billion in savings is likely enough to fill most of the health care-related hole in the state budget! With that money, the state can ensure tens of thousands of Minnesotans get the care they need while preventing closures of Minnesota hospitals and nursing homes that depend on Medicaid for funding.
During the last legislative session, I wrote a column in support of legislation called the Patient-Centered Care bill that would more or less copy what Connecticut did (SF1059/HF255). Unfortunately, neither the state House nor Senate brought it up for serious consideration.
Back then, it was admittedly still uncertain whether Congress would actually pass massive cuts to Medicaid, but it did, and now there are no more excuses. Our state Legislature can quite easily alleviate most of the financial problems Congress has passed onto it and thereby save lives.
All they have to do is pass a not very big but in my opinion quite beautiful bill to cut wasteful MCO middlemen out of our Medicaid program",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2222312159.jpg,,,2025-08-11 07:57:11.236088

Mike Braun and Indiana State Police Superintendent Anthony Scott hold a news conference in the Statehouse on Wednesday, July 16, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)If you commit the “crime” of speaking Spanish in Indiana, watch your back. The Indiana State Police and Indiana National Guard are looking for you.
Gov. Mike Braun recently announced the Indiana State Police, Indiana Department of Correction and the Indiana Department of Homeland Security will join the Indiana National Guard in assisting the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement roundup of immigrants into the United States.
Braun said the state will make 1,000 beds available in the Miami Correctional Facility to imprison people who have been convicted of nothing and have been given no due process rights. The Marion County Sheriff has said he will go along with the order, in part because the federal government pays him per detainee, while the state does not.
This is an affront to anyone who values liberty, limited government and human dignity. It wastes police resources — and Hoosiers’ tax money — in diverting them from searching for and prosecuting crimes against person and property by actual criminals to instead round up peaceful people who are seeking a better life. Immigrants work in our farms, factories and communities, shop at our stores, and contribute positively to our state’s economy and culture.
It’s also a gross violation of the words Braun said on Jan. 13, when he placed his hand on a Bible and swore an oath to God and the people of Indiana that he would uphold and defend both the Indiana and United States Constitutions.
Indiana immigration arrests surge despite stalled ICE partnerships

Participating in President Trump’s scheme to systematically dismantle due process and the rule of law is a clear violation of that solemn oath.
While Braun and Trump claim this is a roundup of “violent illegal immigrants,” the witch hunt has gone far beyond that. Of those being arrested, 71% have no criminal convictions at all – and among those who do, most are for minor offenses – and only 8% have been convicted of violent crimes. The number of those without any conviction being arrested and detained keeps rising.
However, Trump has been eager to not just deport the “violent” criminals, but to round up anyone who is Latino, Asian or Middle Eastern, treating everyone as a potential illegal immigrant, to meet the quota of 3,000 arrests per day vocalized by White House adviser Stephen Miller, while the administration gleefully touts deplorable conditions in detention centers and violates due process rights.
To desperately reach that goal, it means rounding up people who aren’t criminals, but who have fled oppressive communist and socialist regimes and lawfully sought asylum, revoking visas and green cards for students without explanation, and sweeping up U.S. citizens and throwing them in jail.
People showing up for their visa appointments — doing the right thing in good faith — are being arrested in court and taken to faraway detention facilities where they know nobody and have little chance of contacting representation. One was a 20-year-old Purdue student from South Korea who was on an active student visa, but arrested, detained and shipped to Louisiana at her hearing.
This is the work of a banana republic, not a republic bound by a Constitution that has a very clear mandate to protect due process rights and a tradition of “innocent until proven guilty.”
Participating in such a system — and actively and enthusiastically doing so — is denying people their dignity, as well as their human rights.
Our beliefs
As Libertarians, we believe in the sovereignty of the individual and the freedom to live, work and move in peace.
A state government deputizing local and state officers to participate in a federal scheme of rounding up people for the sole crime of looking different or speaking with an accent, on the hopes of “finding illegals” violates that principle. It undermines state sovereignty and also sows distrust between our immigrant communities and local authorities.
The U.S. immigration system is irreparably broken. It is a Byzantine system with a number of hoops and steps someone must jump through to legally emigrate to the U.S., which incentivizes “illegal immigration,” and the Trump administration has doubled down on it by not only making legal immigration more difficult, but revoking visas and arresting and deporting people going through the process the right way for small paperwork errors.
Truly making America great would be living up to the words on the Statue of Liberty – “give us your tired, your poor, your huddled masses, yearning to breathe free” – not weaponizing local police to kidnap, detain and deport people trying to properly follow the system, while revoking visas and making the immigration system more difficult.
The Libertarian Party of Indiana calls for Braun to revoke this promise, to not allow Indiana prisons to be used to detain people who are not criminals, and to honor our tradition of federalism by refusing to comply with the federal authorities carrying out these heinous acts, while we call on the federal government to offer a bridge, not an alligator-infested moat, to those seeking a better life in the great melting pot of the United States.

In his resignation letter to Ferguson, McCallum attributed his departure, effective Aug. 15, partially to “continuous harassment from a former employee that has created significant disruption across the agency.”
“I remain hopeful that such disruption and threats may cease once I depart my role as superintendent,” he wrote to the governor Aug. 1. “Also, with the recent shift to your administration and our school year ending, I believe this is the appropriate time for WSSB to begin a new chapter under new leadership.”

In a court filing in May related to the alleged harassment, McCallum said he worried the former employee would escalate threats and commit violence. He was especially worried since many of the staff at the school are blind or visually impaired. 
“Her continual focus on us and violence, and our particular vulnerabilities has us all worried and scared,” he wrote. “I regularly drive new routes to work. I park in different places at work regularly, always backed in to make for a quick escape. I can’t leave my house without looking out to see if she is outside and I have found new routes to walk my dogs.”
McCallum didn’t respond to requests for further comment last week.
Ferguson tapped Pam Parker, the school’s outreach director, to serve as interim superintendent for the 2025-26 school year.
The school serves blind, visually-impaired and deaf-blind students. Fifty students were enrolled this past school year, according to state data. It has about 100 full-time equivalent employees and a state budget of around $29 million.
McCallum has a national reputation in education of students who are blind or visually impaired. He helped implement the country’s first online adaptive state assessment that is accessible to students who read Braille.
In 2022, the National Federation of the Blind awarded McCallum with the Distinguished Educator of Blind Students award. 
Before coming to Washington, McCallum worked in education in Oregon.

WATERLOO, Iowa — John-Paul Sager appreciates the care he has received at Department of Veterans Affairs hospitals and clinics, but he thinks it should be easier for veterans like him to use their benefits elsewhere.
Sager, a Marine Corps and Army veteran, uses his VA coverage for non-VA treatment of back injuries stemming from his military service. But he said he sometimes must make several phone calls to obtain approval to see a local chiropractor. “It seems like it takes entirely too long,” he said.
Many veterans live hours from VA facilities, or they need health services that aren’t readily available from the VA. In such cases, the department is supposed to provide a referral and pay for private care. Critics say it often hesitates to do so.
Republicans controlling Congress aim to streamline the process of obtaining what is known as community care.
Two Republican senators have introduced legislation that would make it easier for rural veterans to seek care at local hospitals and clinics. The proposals would build on VA community care programs that started under Democratic President Barack Obama and were expanded in Trump’s first term.
Critics worry that steering veterans to private care facilities drains federal money from the VA hospital and clinic system. But supporters say veterans shouldn’t be forced to travel long distances or wait months for the treatment they could obtain at local hospitals and clinics.
“My main concern is for veterans, not for the VA,” Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) told KFF Health News. “I don’t believe we have an obligation to sustain the bureaucracy.”
About 9 million veterans are enrolled in the VA health system. Last year, about 3 million of them — including 1.2 million rural veterans — used their benefits to cover care at non-VA facilities, according to data provided by the department.
Cramer sponsored a bill that would allow veterans who live within 35 miles of a rural, “critical access” hospital to use VA benefits to cover care there or at affiliated clinics without referrals from VA staff.
Cramer, who serves on the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, noted his state has just one VA hospital. It’s in Fargo, on the state’s eastern border, which is more than 400 miles by car from parts of western North Dakota.
Many North Dakota veterans drive past multiple community hospitals to get to the VA hospital for treatment, he said. Meanwhile, many rural hospitals are desperate for more patients and income. “I kept thinking to myself, ‘This doesn’t make any sense at all,’” Cramer said.
Cramer said previous laws, including the VA Mission Act, made it easier for veterans to use their benefits to cover care at community hospitals and clinics.
But he said veterans still must fill out too much paperwork and obtain approval from VA staffers to use non-VA facilities.
“We can’t let the VA itself determine whether a veteran is qualified to receive local care,” he said.
U.S. Rep. Mark Takano of California, who is the top Democrat on the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee, said he sees the need for outside care for some veterans. But he contends Republicans are going overboard in shifting the department’s money to support private health care facilities.
The VA provides specialized care that responds to veterans’ needs and experiences, he argues.
“We must prevent funds from being siphoned away from veterans’ hospitals and clinics, or VA will crumble,” Takano said in a statement released by his office. “Veterans cannot afford for us to dismantle VA direct care in favor of shifting more care to the community.”
Some veterans’ advocacy groups have also expressed concerns.
Jon Retzer, deputy national legislative director for the Disabled American Veterans, said the group wants to make it easier for veterans to find care. Rural and female veterans can have a particularly tough time finding appropriate, timely services at VA hospitals and clinics, he said. But the Disabled American Veterans doesn’t want to see VA facilities weakened by having too much federal money diverted to private hospitals and clinics.
Retzer said it’s true that patients sometimes wait for VA care, but so do patients at many private hospitals and clinics. Most delays stem from staff shortages, he said, which afflict many health facilities. “This is a national crisis.”
Retzer said the Disabled American Veterans favors continuing to require referrals from VA physicians before veterans can seek VA-financed care elsewhere. “We want to ensure that the VA is the primary provider of that care,” he said.
Veterans Affairs Secretary Doug Collins has pledged to improve the community care program while maintaining the strength of the department’s hospitals and clinics. The department declined a KFF Health News request to interview Collins.
Marcus Lewis, CEO of First Care Health Center, which includes a hospital in Park River, North Dakota, supports Cramer’s bill. Lewis is a Navy veteran who uses the VA’s community care option to pay for treatment of a back injury stemming from his military service.
Overall, Lewis said, the community care program has become easier to use. But the application process remains complicated, and participants must repeatedly obtain VA referrals for treatment of chronic issues, he said. “It’s frustrating.”
Park River is a 1,400-person town about 50 miles south of the Canadian border. Its 14-bed hospital offers an array of services, including surgery, cancer care, and mental health treatment. But Lewis regularly sees a VA van picking up local veterans, some of whom travel 140 miles to Fargo for care they’re entitled to receive locally.
“I think a lot of folks just don’t want to fight the system,” he said. “They don’t want to go through the extra hoops, and so they’ll jump in the van, and they’ll ride along.”
Rep. Mike Bost (R-Ill.), chairman of the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee, said veterans in some areas of the country have had more trouble than others in getting VA approval for care from private clinics and hospitals.
Bost helped gain the House’s approval for Trump’s request for $34.7 billion for the community care program in 2026. Although spending on the program has gone up and down in recent years, the appropriation represents an increase of about 50% from what it was in 2025 and 2022. The Senate included similar figures for next year in its version of a military spending budget that passed Aug. 1.
Bost also co-sponsored a House bill that would spell out requirements for the VA to pay for community care.
Sager hopes the new proposals make life easier for veterans. The Gulf War veteran lives in the northeastern Iowa town of Denver. He travels about 15 miles to Waterloo to see a chiropractor, who treats him for back and shoulder pain from injuries he suffered while training Saudi troops in hand-to-hand combat.
Sager, who remains active in the Army Reserve, also visits a Waterloo outpatient clinic run by the VA, where his primary care doctor practices. He appreciates the agency’s mission, including its employment of many veterans. “You just feel like you’re being taken care of by your own,” he said.
He believes the VA can run a strong hospital and clinic system while offering alternatives for veterans who live far from those facilities or who need care the VA can’t promptly provide.
The local VA doesn’t offer chiropractic care, so it pays for Sager to visit the private clinic. But every few months, he needs to obtain fresh approval from the VA. That often requires several phone calls, he said.
Sager is one of about a dozen veterans who use the community care program to pay for visits at Vanderloo Chiropractic Clinic, office manager Linda Gill said.
Gill said the VA program pays about $34 for a typical visit, which is comparable to private insurance, but the paperwork is more burdensome. She said leaders of the chiropractic practice considered pulling out of the VA program but decided to put up with the hassles for a good cause. She wishes veterans didn’t have to jump through so many hoops to obtain convenient care.
“After what they’ve done for us? Please,” she said.

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)Neighborhoods across Milwaukee County are continuing to recover from record-shattering flooding over the weekend. Inundated basements, entire portions of Wauwatosa seemingly underwater, people fleeing the Wisconsin State Fair which shut down early amid rising floodwater and reports of cars literally floating away down roadways all followed the torrential downpour which began Aug. 9. 
The National Weather Service recorded 5.74 inches of rain Saturday, eclipsing the  previous single-day record for Milwaukee of 1.64 inches of rain. Meteorologists say that Saturday was Milwaukee’s second wettest day in 154 years of record keeping. Additional rainfall brought the total up to nearly 7 inches, with some areas expected to get over 10 inches of rain. Researchers have long-warned that increased and more intense rain and flooding would be among the ways climate change would manifest in Wisconsin.

Casey Serrano, a resident of Milwaukee’s North Side left the home she shares with her boyfriend around 8 p.m. Saturday about an hour after the rain started. When she returned around 1 a.m., she saw water in the basement “coming out of our main sewer drain that was covering maybe a quarter to a third of our basement, maybe an inch deep.” During the night, the water rose to nearly 2 feet of “brown runoff from the street,” she said.
Serrano woke up to find there was no  power in her home. “Our immediate street is not flooded, and did not flood last night,” she told Wisconsin Examiner. “But the streets surrounding us flooded pretty heavily.” When she went out on  Silver Spring Drive to get supplies, she saw “within like a 20-block radius of our house there were cars that had clearly floated down Silver Spring.”  
“Thousands in Milwaukee are facing flooding after last night’s storms,” Mayor Cavalier Johnson wrote on X. “Avoid flooded roads — moving water is dangerous. City crews and first responders are working nonstop. Neighbors are stepping up to help neighbors.” The mayor posted that the city was coordinating with Gov. Tony Evers and Milwaukee County on emergency aid and shelters. “Milwaukee is strong,” Mayor Johnson posted. “Together, we’ll get through this.” 
Across Milwaukee County, emergency responders were overwhelmed as the flooding created a cascade of issues with natural gas, debris and power outages. “Very busy night for [Milwaukee Fire Department] & many other FD’s!”, Milwaukee Fire Department Chief Aaron Lipski posted on X. “Over 600 responses between 8pm-7am: numerous fires, water rescues, & many other weather-related emergencies.” 
 


Video shared with Wisconsin Examiner by Casey Serrano, a City of Milwaukee resident who experienced severe basement flooding after the storms on August 9th and 10th, 2025.
 
Online videos showed  cars trapped on flooded roadways and highways. People attending one of the final days of the Wisconsin State Fair were filmed wading through water to leave the fairgrounds. Around 10 p.m. on Sunday the sky began to light up with a new wave of lightning, heralding more rain. Over 18,000 people reportedly lost power during the storms.

“Flooding is still an active emergency situation across Milwaukee County, and we are expecting more rain today and into this evening,” Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley said in a press statement Sunday. “I strongly urge our residents to stay cautious, stay informed, and refrain from traveling. Check  in on your neighbors and loved ones, especially older adults, and seek out emergency assistance if needed. I am thankful for our first responders, law enforcement partners, social services workers, and neighbors who are lending a helping hand during a challenging time. We will get through this together, Milwaukee.”
Local officials are warning residents not to walk into floodwater, as it may be contaminated or be near downed electrical wires. In some areas, the water had strong currents capable of sweeping people away. Those cleaning up debris are encouraged to wear gloves and proper protection, and residents are encouraged to limit water usage (such as by holding off on washing dishes or doing laundry) to reduce the risk of wastewater backing up into basements. 
The suburban city of Wauwatosa produced some of the most dramatic images of flooding throughout the county. According to the Wauwatosa Police Department (WPD), over 500 calls were received by their dispatch center with issues ranging from flooded out basements to blocked storm drains to traffic incidents due to standing water. WPD says there have been no reports of serious injuries, though several major roadways and intersections remain affected and impassable. 
Hart Park, near the Wauwatosa Village, is closed, and police are encouraging people to avoid the area. Sunday afternoon, many people were seen walking through the village area and parts of Hart Park to observe storm damage. Large debris was strewn along the railroad tracks, and reports indicate that the Menomonee River flowing through Hart Park rose from a little over 1 foot high to over 14 feet in a matter of hours. Sunday afternoon the water level was still high, with rushing water ripping through the park continuing to damage green spaces and concrete bike paths. Wauwatosa squad cars used loudspeakers to declare the area closed due to a state of emergency.

Traffic control issues were also reported by the Waukesha Police Department, with the Fox River also under close observation. Waukesha Sheriff’s Department spokesperson Capt. Nicholas Wenzel said in an email statement that the department was “dealing with flooding across the county,” and that no injuries or missing persons had been reported.
For Serrano, the flood is an unprecedented experience. She anticipates costly repairs, including ripping out wood paneling in her house. 
Serrano is also concerned about what the flooding means for the city. “I think that my main concern is that the city is completely unprepared to deal with this, and I think it’s really willful on their part to be honest,” she said. Serrano, who used to work  for the city’s sewage department creating and analyzing data maps, thinks city budget and staffing cuts have adversely affected emergency preparedness. She blames Act 10, which has limited public employees’ collective bargaining rights since 2011, arguing that it  has contributed to staffing shortages and out-dated technology for city departments most responsible for preventing floods, and dealing with their aftermath. 
 










 
Act 12, which mandates that staffing and funding are maintained for the Milwaukee Police Department, also exacerbated the imbalance between police and  other departments including  Public Works, she said. 
“At any point, the Common Council could stand up for residents of this city — especially residents of the North Side,” Serrano said,  “and say we’re not going to deal with this anymore. We are going to fully fund these departments so that they have the right materials and the right resources to fully staff themselves, to fully hire.”",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2975-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-11 06:58:12.367055

Phil Murphy of pushing ""dangerous sanctuary city policies"" after an undocumented immigrant was arrested and charged with a fatal car crash that killed a Lakewood mom and her daughter. (Photos by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images/Dana DiFilippo)State prosecutors sought pretrial detention last month for an undocumented immigrant accused of killing a woman and her daughter in a drunken driving crash in Lakewood, but a Superior Court judge denied the state’s request.
The fatal crash has sparked a new fight between the Trump and Murphy administrations, with the White House accusing Gov. Phil Murphy of pushing “dangerous sanctuary city policies.” President Donald Trump’s pick for U.S. attorney of New Jersey has previously said she’s investigating Murphy, a Democrat, and Attorney General Matt Platkin over a state directive that limits when local law enforcement can cooperate with federal immigration agents.
A Murphy spokesman said the governor believes the man at the center of this fight — Raul Luna-Perez, whom federal authorities said entered the United States illegally from Mexico — should have been deported long ago, and one for Platkin stressed that the state’s directive allows for cooperation with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement regarding anyone charged with a violent crime or convicted of any indictable offense.
Platkin has noted that prosecutors wanted Luna-Perez to remain behind bars after the July 26 fatal crash, which killed Maria Pleitez, 42, and her 11-year-old daughter, Dayanara. At a July 31 court hearing in Ocean County, Gregory Lenzi, assistant county prosecutor, said he was “shocked and appalled” that Luna-Perez was arrested three times in four months for driving under the influence, according to a recording of the hearing obtained by the New Jersey Monitor.
“The defendant was fortunate, following his first DWI, no one was severely injured or killed. He then made the conscious decision to drive intoxicated a second time, 27 days later,” Lenzi said. “Now, your honor, following this third incident, we are here because two people are dead and another is injured.”
A public safety assessment that weighs risk factors to determine whether a defendant should be detained before trial indicated Luna-Perez should be released, Luna-Perez’s defense attorney said. But Lenzi urged Superior Court Judge Wendel E. Daniels to keep Luna-Perez jailed anyway.
“The defendant is clearly an obstruction risk, as he repeatedly operates a motor vehicle in a manner which poses a risk of death and serious bodily injury to every member of the community on the roads, either in a car or on foot,” he said.
Daniels sided with Luna-Perez’s lawyer. He ordered Luna-Perez released but confined to his Red Bank home with an ankle monitor, barred him from operating a vehicle, and ordered a substance abuse evaluation.
“As the state argued, his conduct was conscious and deliberate, getting behind the wheel allegedly under the influence. That resulted in a tragedy and also presented a danger to the community as well,” Daniels said. “However, his attorney argued, and rightfully so, this defendant has no other pending charges, no disorderly persons convictions, no indictable convictions, no violent convictions.”
Luna-Perez’s release turned out to be temporary. Immigration agents later arrested him, and on Thursday, Ocean County authorities said they retrieved him from a migrant jail in Elizabeth and brought him back to an Ocean County jail as they seek a second time to keep him behind bars.
“His return sends a clear message that our federal partners share in our mission to hold those individuals that commit serious crimes accountable — regardless of their immigration status,” Ocean County Prosecutor Bradley D. Billhimer said in a statement.
Ocean County has resisted the state directive, known as the Immigration Trust Directive. In 2019 it sued the state to invalidate the order, saying it was preempted by federal law. A federal judge ruled against the county, a decision that was upheld by the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals in August 2021.
 Charges

Luna-Perez was initially charged with two counts each of vehicular homicide and assault by auto. Authorities say he was speeding and driving drunk, crossed double-yellow lines into oncoming traffic, and collided head-on with a car driven by Pleitez. Luna-Perez’s blood alcohol level was about three times the legal limit at the time of the crash, authorities say.
After Luna-Perez was released by the judge in Ocean County, county prosecutors slapped him with two counts each of aggravated manslaughter and strict liability vehicular homicide.
Luna-Perez has several prior arrests but no convictions, court records show. He was arrested on March 20 and April 17 by Red Bank police and charged with driving under the influence. He was accused of domestic violence in a June 2023 complaint that was later withdrawn, so the matter was dismissed, state courts spokeswoman MaryAnn Spoto said.
White House spokesman Abigail Jackson said the blame for the crash “rests squarely with Governor Murphy.”
“This criminal illegal alien had three prior arrests by local police — including two that were for driving under the influence. The innocent people he killed should still be alive today — and they would be if it weren’t for sanctuary policies that protect criminal illegal aliens. President Trump is committed to carrying out the largest mass deportation operation of criminal illegal aliens in history and Making America Safe Again,” Jackson said.
The Immigrant Trust Directive, first issued in 2018, restricts when local and state law enforcement can help federal immigration authorities and bars them from asking about immigration status during certain encounters. But the directive says when it comes to certain violent and serious offenses, including assault, cops are allowed to cooperate with immigration agents.
“To be clear, nothing in the Immigrant Trust Directive would have prevented New Jersey law enforcement from cooperating with federal immigration officials to deport this defendant. And we reiterate that the Immigrant Trust Directive allows for cooperation with ICE in regard to anyone charged with a violent crime or convicted of any indictable offense,” said Platkin spokeswoman Sharon Lauchaire.
Mahen Gunaratna, a Murphy spokesman, said Luna-Perez should have faced repercussions for his previous charges.
“The Governor believes that Mr. Luna-Perez, who has been arrested multiple times for DUI and domestic violence, should not have been allowed behind the wheel and should have already been deported due to his previous dangerous criminal activity,” Gunaratna said.
Prosecutors at the July 31 hearing discussed details from Luna-Perez’s two previous DWI arrests.
On March 20, police accused him of hitting another car that was attempting to park. He failed roadside sobriety tests and had a blood alcohol content of 0.186, more than twice the legal limit of 0.08, police said.
On April 17, police said he nearly hit a marked Red Bank police car head-on. Officers found multiple Modelo cans in his car, and he attempted to get rid of an open can by spilling it all over the inside of his truck, police said. His blood alcohol content then was 0.16, they said.
“His actions have been egregious, and with three documented incidents, has given this court zero reason to believe he will abide by any condition of release,” Lenzi said during last week’s hearing. “Your honor has the authority to … not give this defendant a fourth opportunity to do this again.”
Luna-Perez’s immigration status was not discussed at that hearing.

(Photo courtesy of Howard Rynearson) After years of failing to advance legislation to eliminate Idaho’s sales tax on groceries, an effort has launched to make the change via voter ballot initiative. 
Howard Rynearson, Payette County GOP Central Committee chairman, is leading the charge to gather enough signatures to place the measure on the November 2026 ballot.  
“People are very, very disgusted and tired of the fact that we’ve not been able to do this,” Rynearson told the Idaho Capital Sun in a phone interview. 
If passed, the “Repeal Idaho’s Grocery Tax” initiative would in fiscal year 2028 eliminate Idaho’s 6% sales tax on food items, as defined by the federal Supplemental Nutrition and Assistant Program, or SNAP. The sales tax would remain for alcohol, tobacco, and restaurant sales of food or “hot food products ready for immediate consumption.”  
The initiative would also eliminate the Idaho Grocery Tax Credit, which is meant to offset the sales tax on food spent throughout the year. 
Rynearson said the elimination of the tax is “the most achievable tax repeal that we can do right now.” 
He said that although the Idaho Republican Party is strongly behind the move, he is pursuing the initiative proposal as an individual. 
 Idaho lawmakers have failed to advance bills to repeal the sales tax on food 

In 2017, the Idaho Legislature passed a bill eliminating the sales tax on food, known colloquially as the “grocery tax,”  but then-Gov. Butch Otter vetoed the bill, saying the costs were “too high,” the Idaho Statesman reported at the time.   
Since then, other efforts have been discussed or attempted but none advanced. Many of the proposals have come in the form of “personal bills,” which go around the committee process and are typically stored with the clerk and do not advance. Rynearson said committee chairs and leaders have refused to hear proposed bills in hearings. 
During this year’s legislative session, the Legislature passed and Gov. Brad Little signed a law increasing the grocery tax credit from $120 a year per person to $155 per person per year. 
Idaho Gov. Brad Little signs bill to increase grocery tax credit

During Senate debate on the bill, Sen. Christy Zito, R-Mountain Home, attempted to send the bill to what’s known as the 14th order, in which senators may propose amendments, for the purpose of changing the bill to eliminate the grocery tax, the Sun reported. Her procedural move failed in a 5-28 vote. 
Amid calls to instead eliminate the sales tax on food and the tax credit entirely, bill sponsor and House Majority Leader Jason Monks, R-Meridian, said that keeping the grocery credit allowed the state to continue collecting revenue on groceries bought by out-of-state visitors, the Sun reported. 
Rynearson countered this logic. 
“The tourism situation is way overstated,” he said. “Most people that travel through the state are tourists going from one state to the other, they generally eat at restaurants or fast food businesses. Those are exempted from this repeal.” 
Idaho is one of 13 states that applies sales tax to food, according to the Coeur d’Alene-based conservative think tank Mountain States Policy Center. The policy center commissioned a poll in 2024 that found 87% of respondents were in favor of eliminating the sales tax on groceries.

 Ballot initiative would decrease state revenue 

The state does not track how much of its sales tax revenue is generated from grocery purchases. To create the required fiscal impact statement for the proposed initiative, the Division of Financial Management used information from Utah, which does track this information. 
Utah’s data showed that groceries typically comprised 11% to 13% of retail sales, according to the impact statement. The division projected sales tax revenue of $3.7 billion, and estimated a loss of revenue of $410 million to $485 million total. 
However, because the initiative would also eliminate the grocery tax credit, which costs the state between $210 million and $255 million, the net revenue loss would be $200 million and $230 million, according to the impact statement. 
In 2024, the state collected nearly $3.1 billion in total sales tax revenue, according to the Idaho State Tax Commission annual report. The Legislature this year also passed historic cuts to income and property taxes, reducing revenues by an estimated more than $400 million annually. These tax cuts and other legislation passed the past two years draw down sales tax revenue, which was a driving factor in the state reporting revenue coming in $141.5 million below projections near the end of fiscal year 2025, the Sun reported. 
Rynearson expressed doubts that the sales tax revenue would increase in the next two years as much as projected in the impact statement, but said he opted not to challenge the statement. 
 Initiative backed by Idaho GOP 

Rynearson said he did not think the issue was political and that any registered voter could be involved or interested in making the change, but leaders of the Idaho Republican Party are supporting the effort. 
Idaho GOP Chairwoman Dorothy Moon this week wrote in an opinion piece that “it’s time to end the grocery tax.” 
“If the Legislature won’t act, it’s time for the people of Idaho to get it done,” Moon wrote. 
Members of the party voted this summer in favor of a resolution, sponsored by Rynearson, to support an initiative repealing the sales tax on groceries. 
Many in the party have also expressed support for limiting the ballot initiative process. 
During the party’s 2025 winter meeting, Rynearson also brought forward a resolution that was approved to increase the threshold for the signatures needed to get an initiative on the ballot. 
The resolution states that because the process “bypasses the Legislature,” it should increase the threshold from 6% of registered voters in at least 18 of Idaho’s 35 legislative districts to at least 10% of registered voters in 23 of 35 districts. 
Rynearson said at the time of that meeting, he “wasn’t that impressed with the initiative” process. 
“I thought we were such a red state, we didn’t need it, but then came the option that we really needed it,” he said.  
Moon in her newsletter addressed some of the criticism of the initiative process. 
“I know what you might be thinking: ‘Aren’t ballot initiatives tools of the left?’” Moon wrote. “Sometimes, yes. But there’s an important difference here. This initiative is bottom-up and driven entirely by the grassroots.” 
Initiative supporters will need to gather more than 70,000 signatures, including at least 6% of registered voters in 18 of 35 legislative districts. Rynearson said he and supporters are visiting state fairs and encouraging small business owners to put petitions in their lobbies.

Sign up for Hechinger’s weekly newsletter. 
BELOIT, Wis. — As Chris Hooker eyed a newly built piece of ductwork inside Beloit Memorial High School, a wry smile crept over his face. “If you worked for me,” he told a student, considering the obviously crooked vent, “I might ask if your level was broken.”
Hooker, the HVAC manager of Lloyd’s Plumbing and Heating Corp. in nearby Janesville, was standing inside a hangar-sized classroom in the school’s advanced manufacturing academy, where students construct full-size rooms, hang drywall and learn the basics of masonry. His company sends him to the school twice a week for about two months a year to help teach general heating, venting and air conditioning concepts to students. 
“I cover the mountaintop stuff,” he said, noting that at a minimum students will understand HVAC when they become homeowners.
But the bigger potential payoff is that these students could wind up working alongside Hooker after they graduate. If his firm has an opening, any student recommended by teacher Mike Wagner would be a “done deal,” Hooker said. “Plus, if they come through this class, I know them.” 
Manufacturing and construction dominate the business needs inside Beloit, a small city of 36,000 just minutes from the Illinois border. Sitting at the nexus of two major highways, and within 100 miles of Chicago, Milwaukee and Madison, Beloit is home to a range of businesses that include a Frito-Lay production plant, an Amazon distribution center and a Navy subcontractor. In the next two years, a $500 million casino and hotel complex is scheduled to open. 
But staffing these companies into the future is a major concern. Across the country, the average age of manufacturing workers is increasing, and one in four of these workers is age 55 or older, according to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ 2021 figures, the most recent available. In many other jobs the workforce is aging, too. Wisconsin is one of several states looking to boost career and technical education, or CTE, as a possible solution to the aging and shrinking workforce. 
While the unemployment rate of Rock County, which includes Beloit, is 3.6 percent, only slightly higher than the state’s 3.2 percent, there’s a worker mismatch in the city, according to Drew Pennington, its economic development director.
Every day, 14,000 city residents travel outside of Beloit to work, while the same number commute into the city to fill mostly higher-paying jobs, said Pennington. 
So when Beloit decided to revamp its public high school in 2018, CTE and work-based learning were at the forefront of the transformation. 
The 1,225-student school now has three academies that cover 13 different career paths. After ninth grade, students choose to concentrate in an area, which means taking several courses in a specific field. Students also have the option to do work-based learning, which can mean internships, a youth apprenticeship or working at high-end simulated job sites inside the school. 
“This creates not just a pipeline to jobs but also to career choices,” said Jeff Stenroos, the district’s director of CTE and alternative education.

“There are a lot of really good-paying jobs in this area. Students don’t need to leave, or go earn a four-year degree,” Stenroos said. An auto mechanic can “earn six figures by the age of 26 and that’s more than an educator with a master’s degree,” he said.
Beloit’s effort is a shift in high school emphasis similar to the extensive CTE programs being run in other places, notably Indiana, Kentucky and Alabama. In 2024, 40 states enacted 152 CTE-related policies, the biggest push in five years, according to Advance CTE, a nonprofit group that represents state CTE officials. Nationwide, about 20 percent of high school students take a concentration of CTE courses, it says, adding that the high school graduation rate for students who concentrate in CTE is 90 percent, 15 percentage points higher than the national average. 
Three years ago, Wisconsin called for 7 percent of its high school students to be in workplace learning programs by 2026. Beloit’s progress puts it far ahead of that target. In Beloit Memorial, nearly 1 in 3 students meet this designation today, Stenroos said. 
The high school features a cavernous construction area where students build full-scale rooms, learn masonry and complete plumbing and electrical wiring projects. The metal shop offers 16 welding stations and a die-cutter machine that allows students to create customized pieces to fit projects. Down the street, the school runs an eight-bay car repair center, a space it took over when a Sears autobody shop left town.
These spaces are “better than a lot of technical colleges,” Stenroos said.
In addition to their high school courses, Beloit Memorial students pile up industry-recognized certifications, Stenroos said. More than 40 percent of its students graduate with at least one certification, and 1 in 4 of them has multiple certifications. 
While some simple certifications, such as OSHA Workplace Safety, can be accomplished in just 10 hours, others, such as those for the American Welding Society, require up to 500 hours of student work, he added. The state has called for 9 percent of graduating high school students to have earned at least one certification by next year. To incentivize schools to offer these opportunities, the state’s Department of Workforce Development pays schools for each student who earns a certification; in 2024, Beloit received $85,000 through this program, Stenroos said.
One of the school’s best automotive students, Geiry Lopez, graduated this year with five Automotive Service Excellence certifications. Standing less than 5 feet tall, Lopez said she is not bothered that she might not look like a typical mechanic. “I know I can do this,” she said, adding that she hopes to work on heavy machinery such as tractor trailers after she graduates.
She’s worked on her own car, with some fellow students, replacing the brakes, a front axle, rotors and wheel bearings at the school’s garage, she said, although she still hasn’t been able to drive it.
“My dad is taking forever to teach me how to drive,” she said.

The garage operates like an actual business, but the only customers are teachers and other Beloit staffers and students. Students estimate work costs, order parts and communicate with customers before any repairs take place. While oil changes and brake replacements are common, some students are totally rebuilding an engine in one car. 
Over in the welding room, rising senior Cole Mellom was putting the finishing touches on a smoker he built in less than a month’s time. He said he loved the creativity of finding a plan, cutting the metal and building something that he could sell, all while in school. Plus, he knows that welding is a key skill needed for his dream job, race-car fabrication.
In the past, students created a custom-made protective plate that the city’s police use on a bomb squad vehicle.
The welding program has 125 students this year and had to turn away 65 more because of space limitations, Stenroos said; last year, 17 of the school’s welding academy graduates enlisted in the armed forces to specialize in welding. 
These programs are designed to help meet the future needs of the state’s workforce. More than one-third of Wisconsin jobs will require education beyond high school but less than a bachelor’s degree by 2031, according to the Association for Career and Technical Education. For the last four years, the state has had more job openings than people on unemployment.
“There’s more jobs than there are people to fill them right now,” said Deb Prowse, a former career academy coach at Beloit Memorial who now works at Craftsman with Character, an area nonprofit that helps train students for careers in skilled trades.

Hooker, the Lloyd’s Plumbing HVAC manager, agreed. “Every project we work on has a delay, from a multimillion-dollar mansion to a three-bedroom spec,” he said. “There aren’t enough workers.”
The main reason Beloit Memorial has been able to zoom past state and national goals for both CTE and work-based learning is the school’s single-minded focus since 2018 on helping to ensure that its graduates will understand what businesses need and giving them a head start toward gaining those skills.
High school officials actually pared back the program from 44 pathways to 13, Stenroos said, part of an effort to tie each pathway to specific jobs. About 75 percent of pathways target area jobs, with the remaining quarter highlighting prominent professions within the state, he added. 
Even though three straight budget referendum defeats have left the district with a $6.2 million funding gap, Stenroos said he’s been able to keep the CTE equipment modernized through donations and strategic allocation of the school’s federal Perkins grant and the state reimbursement for student certifications. In one instance, the school recently bought a $20,000 scanner for its automotive program; the machine can not only help diagnose a car problem, but also connect students to garages throughout the country that have successfully fixed the specified problem. 
“It’s an expensive piece of equipment,” Stenroos said, “but it’s industry-certified and will give students real-life experience.”
Each of the three academies has an advisory board of teachers and industry professionals who work out how to embed practical lessons in classroom curriculum. “We ask business people, ‘What do you need, and how can we help our kids get there?’ ” said Stenroos.
“It’s really cool how receptive the school is to feedback,” said Heather Dobson, the business development manager at Corporate Contractors, Inc., a 200-person general contracting firm.
She explained that the district has incorporated small changes over the years, such as having students work in Microsoft programs instead of Google Classroom apps and teaching them how to write a professional email.
“Rarely is there an idea presented that they don’t embrace,” said Celestino Ruffini, the CEO of Visit Beloit, a nonprofit that promotes tourism of the city. The school is expanding its hospitality program because of the expected influx of jobs connected to the new casino and hotel, he said. 
All the changes aren’t at the high school, however. In order to employ Beloit Memorial students, Frito-Lay had to alter its corporate policy of not allowing anyone under 18 to work in its plants, according to Angela Slagle, a supply chain manager there. The company now hires Beloit Memorial students for its career exploration youth apprenticeship program, she added. 
The connection to area businesses goes beyond the school’s leaders. Each year, about 10 teachers complete an externship in which they spend one week of their summer at a local business. Teachers are paid $1,000 for the 20 hours, and they not only learn about what jobs a company may have but also find ways to incorporate real-world problems into their classroom lessons.
A few summers back, math teacher Michelle Kelly spent a week at Corporate Contractors. She was searching for different ways to use construction-based math problems with her students. In addition to using math to estimate a bid for a project or calculate the surface area of a job, she realized that complex math is needed to build a truss, the framework used to support a roof or bridge.
Because the triangular truss is supported by different lengths of wood inside its structure, Kelly said, building one requires the calculation of angles, total area, how much wood is needed and more. Since all her algebra students were in the school’s construction academy, she partnered with those teachers to go beyond blueprints and have the 10th graders build trusses, a collection of which sit in the back of her classroom.
She sees this work as one way to help counter the chronic absenteeism that has existed since Covid. Teaching with this kind of hands-on work makes students see the relevance of algebra, she said. “Would it be easier to just have them take a test? Yes.” 
Beloit Memorial Principal Emily Pelz said the school’s work is paying off. In the last four years, the school’s four-year graduation rate has ticked up slightly, from 83.4 percent in 2021-22 to 85.2 percent in 2024-25, while its attendance went from 78.5 percent to 84.8 percent in the same period, Pelz said. 
Rik Thomas, a rising senior who already has his own business repairing and modifying cars, said this work has definitely made him more interested in school. While he thought the academy would merely explain what a construction career might include, “It’s nice to find out how to do the work.” His father works in construction and, Thomas added, “He loves that I take this program.” 
Thomas and his classmates built a wooden shed earlier this year and were able to sell it for $2,500, with the money going to pay for more materials. Likewise, the first smoker created in the welding class was bought by Stenroos; the students are looking forward to posting the second one for sale after they determine how much they should charge. 
While the school’s construction and other trade-related fields have drawn the most attention, its three academies also offer career paths in healthcare, education, business, the arts, hospitality and more. 
For example, rising senior Tayvon Cates said he hopes to study pre-med at a historically Black college or university on his way to becoming a cardiology radiologist. Cates, who is in the school’s health and education academy, said, “If you want to do something, the school can help you do it.”

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch.Iowa State University is charging up to become a destination for academics and industry dealing in battery fabrication and testing, with new equipment opening doors for expanded study of the power source.
Todd Kingston, an ISU researcher and assistant professor of mechanical engineering, said the accelerating rate calorimeter system now housed at the university and used for battery testing will hopefully draw in interested students. It would act as a centerpiece of a “shared facility,” where ISU researchers and collaborators can create prototypes and test these and other batteries.
“Various users across campus will have the ability to come in and use that, but we’re hoping to even extend that to partners outside of the university, ones that maybe necessarily don’t have the capabilities or the equipment, or perhaps also the expertise to do some sort of the testing that they want,” Kingston said. “So we can perhaps even work with them to do that testing, provide that expertise, that training … and those resources to them.”

The new equipment was purchased for the university through grant funding from the U.S. Department of Defense’s Office of Naval Research, which Kingston secured. It took several months to install and integrate into lab infrastructure, he said, but the machinery has been up and running for some time.
Both new and used battery cells can be tested with the equipment, Kingston said, allowing researchers to see how they respond under various conditions at different stages of wear. The conditions placed upon the cells can range from electrical to thermal to mechanical, with data being taken on temperature, pressure, voltage, self-heating levels and more in real time.
Batteries are sometimes pushed past their limits as part of testing, Kingston said, leading to their damage or even full destruction. As the batteries are encased in the equipment, researchers can stand just a few feet away and monitor the tests through a computer system.
Qusai Alahmad, a third-year Ph.D. student studying mechanical engineering at ISU, called the new ARC equipment an “amazing tool” — one he’s been able to use already as part of a project funded by the Office of Naval Research.
In addition to funding the purchase of the equipment, Kingston said the Office of Naval Research has provided grant dollars to multiple projects that utilize the ARC system and look at metrics associated with batteries and what characteristics can influence their level of safety.
One of these projects has ISU researchers testing effects of thermal gradients on battery safety, and another has the university running battery tests to verify predictive modeling for “thermal runaway,” or when a battery goes beyond its limits, developed at the University of Arizona.

Battery safety is a topic that is growing in popularity and importance, Alahmad said, as lithium-ion batteries can be found everywhere, from phones to cars to satellites.
“Looking into it is very important, right, not only for the environment, but for the safety of people using these batteries,” Alahmad said. “Since it’s part of my funding, it’s really exciting.”
There are only a handful of ARC systems currently operating across the U.S., Kingston said, and even fewer are housed in university labs. This allows ISU to conduct research and testing that cannot be done elsewhere due to safety hazards.
Joined by other ISU researchers and utilizing internal funding from the Office of the President, Kingston said he is working to create a center where batteries can be crafted and tested on-site. Other equipment is still being installed for the center which will expand the kinds of batteries that can be fabricated.
Beyond academic study and potential partnerships with businesses and organizations, Kingston said the new equipment and center for battery testing will be helpful in workforce development, as ISU graduates will head into the world with experiences and skills they would have a hard time finding elsewhere.
More and more students, ranging from their undergraduate to graduate education, are becoming increasingly interested in battery technology, Kingston said, and he hopes the center and its toys will aid in recruitment and retention.
“It takes lots of different disciplines, knowledge, expertise to be able to tackle all the difficult problems associated with batteries,” Kingston said. “And so I hope that that attracts a lot of students from wide backgrounds to campus to come and learn and take advantage of the resources that we have.”

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)Schools start up again this week for hundreds of thousands of Oklahoma students, and our public classrooms are in the throes of a massive teacher shortage.
Our children return from summer breaks suffering from some of the highest rates of adverse childhood experiences related to abuse, neglect and mental health struggles. Many of them are hungry. And they’re not excelling in school.
But the adults whose job is championing strategies to improve our kids’ futures are too busy bickering about their own adverse adult experience involving images of nude women shown on Superintendent Ryan Walters’ office television.
In their quest to defend their honor and tarnish someone else’s to prove they’re the wounded party in this debacle, they all seem to have forgotten who they’re supposed to be serving: our children.
Everybody that doesn’t live in a happy bubble knows that our school children today are dealing with worse things than a little shared nudity among adults. I suspect some children have probably dealt with worse in the month.
After all, they’re continually facing the threat of school shootings. Ours is a state that experiences high rates of domestic violence, high poverty rates, low health care outcomes, and high rates of childhood hunger. 
We’ve experienced a recent drop to 50th in the country in education quality. We rank 48th worst in per pupil spending, investing a pitiful $11,349 per student. Our teacher pay is 38th worst in the country, about $2,300 below the regional average. 
But instead of focusing on those struggles, we’re witnessing the bitter implosion of a seven-member governing board that is supposed to be working together to advocate for policies that chart a better path forward for our children. We’ve got a state superintendent and members of the board who have embarked on a bizarre crusade to prove they’re the true victims here.
Meanwhile, an initial probe released by Republican House Speaker Kyle Hilbert indicates that this brouhaha may boil down to adults being exposed to a little-remembered, R-rated Jackie Chan Hollywood flick that had scenes featuring fully nude women.
Hilbert said his findings seem “to vindicate” both Walters and the board members and these images weren’t shown intentionally.
If anything, Hilbert’s findings make this situation seem even more absurd.
Why was this board even watching TV in the first place during a closed-door meeting? They were supposed to be considering high-stakes matters that impact students, families, teacher licenses and schools. The television shouldn’t have been on, and the fact that it was makes me wonder if anyone is actually taking their responsibilities seriously.
But instead of taking responsibility for that blunder, two education board members last week decided the best course of action was to dump gasoline on this dumpster fire by firing off a statement that included “what we saw on TV is content that would get the certificate of any teacher in this state revoked had it showed up on a classroom TV.” 
Here we go again.
It’s not exactly shocking that a governing board that stripped one teacher’s license for providing high school students with a way to access an online library catalog that contains banned books would threaten the same punishment for another educator showing R-rated movies to people over 17. Is it any wonder that qualified teachers are fleeing to Texas or exiting the profession in droves?
I attended high school in a high-performing district in Texas. I occasionally viewed R-rated movies like “The Patriot,” and those teachers didn’t have their livelihoods threatened.
Maybe if Republican leadership stood up with the same gusto to Walters’ agenda that directly impacts students when it comes time to set academic standards or invest millions on Bible class in public schools we could take them seriously. 
It’s clear that the losers here are our public schools and the roughly 700,000 children that rely on them. 
It’s unfortunate that this debacle has distracted from that.
When Gov. Kevin Stitt ousted three State Board of Education members in February, he said he was sick of the panel driving up “needless political drama.” 
“If we want to be the best state for business, we need to make sure our kids have a path to success,” he said at the time. “It’s time for some fresh eyes and a renewed focus on our top ten goals.”
In a rare occurrence, I wholeheartedly agreed with the governor. I’d been looking forward to seeing what fresh ideas this board has to offer because what we’re doing isn’t moving the needle in the right direction.
Maybe the Board of Education needs to go back to school. Is this the best we can do?
I’m waiting for someone, anyone, to step up, show some leadership and remember what really matters here. 
Our children.

Vermont now has a methadone clinic in each region of the state. That convenience brings treatment options to people who didn’t have access before, officials and recovery coaches say.

BENNINGTON — Tucked into a nondescript strip mall downtown, Bennington’s new methadone clinic has seen about 70 patients walk through its one-way glass doors since opening in late June.  
Inside, the building’s four hallways form a loop, offering patients a literal road to recovery. First-timers walk in to their right and visit with doctors in offices along the corridor one by one. They can get their first dose of methadone, a medicine prescribed for opioid use disorder, that day. 
It’s the first time that people who live in Bennington County have access to the medication in their own backyard, which opens up access and provides stability for people, health officials and recovery coaches said. 
With the clinic’s opening, Vermont now has a methadone clinic in each region of the state after building plans were complicated for years, said Kelly Dougherty, deputy commissioner of the Vermont Department of Health. The Bennington clinic offers a glimpse of how methadone can help people in recovery.
In past years, it was a job on its own to get on meds for recovery, said Dylan Jonhson, a recovery coach at Turning Point in Bennington. 
One of Jonhson’s clients spent hours each day on the bus to a clinic in North Adams, Massachusetts. That trip would take up most of the client’s day, he said. And if they missed the bus, it could cause painful withdrawals and put their path to sobriety at risk. 
Now, that client goes to the local clinic in town, which has offered them much more stability. 
“They just got a job this week, and I guarantee you it’s because they didn’t have to go to North Adams,” Johnson said.

Many others also made the trek to North Adams regularly, said Sean Cossey, the clinic’s director. Now, Cossey’s trying to slowly funnel those people to the new clinic to make their lives easier. About 20% of the clinic’s clients so far have never received treatment before, he said. 
“The only thing I can’t do is make them walk in. But if they do walk in, they’ll be met with respect, they’ll be met as a person,” Cossey said. 
The clinic’s opening has been mostly celebrated by the community, Cossey said. About 50 people showed up for a July 23 ribbon cutting ceremony, he said. Then U.S. Rep. Becca Balint, D-Vt., and Rep. Paul Tonko, D-N.Y., came to tour the facility on July 29. Their visit sparked a roundtable discussion among local recovery groups about treating opioid use. 
“Success rates in recovery are pretty low,” Johnson said. But methadone is considered the gold standard — and it’s important that people in town have the option for treatment, he said. 
In 2024, 183 Vermonters died from opioid-related deaths, and five of those deaths happened in Bennington County, according to data from the Vermont Department of Health. 
While many embrace the opening, there are still some in Bennington who have a stigma about methadone, Cossey said. He’s confident that stigma comes from a lack of education. 
“We’re giving out medication to people that suffer from a clinically diagnosed disorder,” Cossey said. 
It’s a highly regulated medication. The clinic was built around its pharmaceutical safe, Cossey said. That was just one required specification to follow regulations from The Drug Enforcement Administration. A $3.9 million grant from the state that lasts through July 2026 helped the clinic meet the requirements.
While methadone isn’t the only medication used to treat substance use disorder, many consider it to be the most effective. People who have been using opioids start by taking the medication every day at first, then wane off of it very slowly, Johnson said. 
“It’s basically impossible to quit cold turkey,” Johnson said. 
Methadone significantly reduces symptoms of withdrawal, which helps those prescribed the medication stabilize their life as they begin recovery, Johnson said. That stability can help people find housing, repair relationships in their life or gain employment, he said.
Johnson himself uses his experience in recovery to help others navigate the journey. He tried quitting without medications 15 to 20 times — but each time he “failed spectacularly,” he said with his eyes closed as he raised his hands in the air. 
He then started taking suboxone, another medication to treat opioid use disorder, and it has helped him remain clean for 6 years. Johnson said it helped relieve painful body aches and gastrointestinal issues he suffered as withdrawal symptoms.
Now, he considers himself a success story and tries to help others through their own recovery. Johnson said he continues to take suboxone in small doses and hopes to be able to discontinue the medication completely soon. 
Other facilities in the Bennington area, like small clinics or doctors offices, have offered other medications to treat opioid use disorder for years. But many think methadone has unique potential to help those in the early stages of recovery. 
The stigma comes from the fact that methadone is technically a psychoactive drug, Johnson said. But if someone has used heroin for years, they will not feel a high from the medication, he said. 
Other medications, like suboxone or buprenorphine, have blockers that stop people from feeling high if they continue using opioids while on the medication. With methadone, people can still feel the effects of other drugs. And that’s partly where the stigma comes from, Johnson said.

Patients at the Bennington clinic are closely monitored and must provide urine samples regularly, Cossey said. Patients prescribed methadone also receive counseling resources and are assigned a case manager, he said. 
Patients take doses in a room about the size of a telephone booth in front of an employee who sits behind a counter. After the medication is ingested patients stay for about 20 minutes while medical professionals observe them. 
Cossey said the facility is still reaching its full potential. There are still a number of staff positions available that are proving difficult to fill, he said. With more staff, the facility will be able to serve up to 400 patients, he said. Whether it’s someone’s second or tenth time in recovery, there’s no judgement, Cossey said.

(Photo by Derek White/Getty Images for Bentonville Film Festival)A couple of years ago, Alisa Jno-Charles saw her now 9-year-old daughter watching a YouTube video of several children and their swift ninja moves.
The video was from Ninja Kidz TV, a YouTube channel that features four young siblings who were raised in a martial arts studio, according to their official website. The channel has about 23.9 million subscribers.
Jno-Charles scrolled through the Ninja Kidz TV videos and noticed that the content featured more than just the kids’ ninja antics: Every single part of their lives was documented, she said.
“It was their first date, and their insecurities about social situations, and major life decisions — like the type of school they should go to — and their birthday parties,” Jno-Charles said. “It was everything. And that didn’t sit well with me.”
Jno-Charles did some more digging into “kidfluencing” on YouTube. She knew, of course, about social media influencers, and that it had become accepted as a legitimate job — for adults. But were there protections, she wondered, “for children who can’t actually make that decision to go into that business themselves?”
An increasing number of state lawmakers are asking the same question.
In the absence of federal regulations, some legislators are pushing to protect child influencers. Many of the measures aim to ensure kids are compensated fairly for their work, by requiring adult account managers — usually their parents — to set aside any earnings in a trust fund the children can access once they are adults. Some of the bills also aim to give children more control over the content they are featured in.
The experience with her daughter prompted Jno-Charles, an assistant professor of entrepreneurship at Babson College in Wellesley, Massachusetts, to research the fast-growing industry.
In a paper published earlier this year in the Journal of Business Ethics, Jno-Charles and Canadian researcher Daniel Clark concluded that kidfluencing was “a new form of child labor” that can financially exploit kids and violate their privacy, among other harms.
“Kidfluencing represents a uniquely insidious threat because [it’s] seemingly so benign,” Jno-Charles and Clark wrote. “It is prone to willful blindness from the parents, the platforms, the audience, and society at large.”
The risks are especially great, they argue, when kidfluencers are the family’s primary source of income, “obscuring the distinction between the best interests of the child and those of the family.”
But Jno-Charles said many of the state bills focus on financial compensation while ignoring other issues, such as the child’s reputation and whether it will harm their future employment opportunities, relationships and more.
“We’ve seen so many stories come out on families that have exploited and abused their children in a lot of very terrible ways, the least of which is monetarily,” she said. “How do you protect children from those situations? I feel like these regulations are a good start, but it’s not really addressing what I perceive to be the true issues around influence.”
 40 million subscribers

Kidfluencers and other content creators make money by hawking products and services to the people who follow them. The job has become increasingly lucrative as companies spend more on social media marketing. Some influencers can earn $10,000 or more for a single post, said Alex Ambrose, a policy analyst at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a nonprofit focused on science and technology.
Ryan’s World is largely credited as being the first kidfluencer channel on YouTube. The channel got its start in 2015 with videos featuring 3-year-old Ryan Kaji, who enjoyed unboxing new toys.
Today, Ryan is entering his teen years, and Ryan’s World has nearly 40 million subscribers. The Ryan’s World brand is managed by Sunlight Entertainment, a family-owned production company headed by Ryan’s father. And this year, Ryan Kaji was No. 21 on the Forbes Top Creators list, with $35 million in earnings as of late June.
“It’s so easy for children to just start creating,” Ambrose said. “And with TikTok and Instagram, the ability to edit videos and edit content now is so much easier than it was in the past. You can just start creating with very simple tools that are available to folks.”
Kidfluencers are growing in popularity across nearly every social media platform. While some youths have started accounts on their own, others are managed and monitored by their parents.
Other forms of media already have labor standards. Children who appear on television or in films have contracts that stipulate what they will be paid. Some states, including California, Illinois, Louisiana, New Mexico and New York, have laws mandating that employers of child actors set aside a portion of their earnings — generally 15% — in a trust the actors can access when they become adults.
The first such law was enacted by California in 1939. The Coogan Law was inspired by child actor Jackie Coogan, who played the title role in Charlie Chaplin’s “The Kid” and was one of Hollywood’s first child stars. When Coogan became an adult, he discovered that his parents had squandered much of the money he had earned.
 States step in

In 2023, Illinois expanded its version of the Coogan Law to include kidfluencers, and California followed suit in 2024 (the laws took effect in 2024 and 2025, respectively).
This year, at least four states — Arkansas, Montana, Utah and Virginia — have amended their child labor laws to mandate trusts and other protections for content creators who are minors. And when Hawaii this year approved its own version of the Coogan Law, it included child influencers in the definition of minors engaged in “theatrical employment.”
The New Jersey General Assembly and the New York Senate also approved child influencer legislation this year, but neither has become law.
Arkansas Republican state Rep. Zack Gramlich, who sponsored the legislation in his state, is a schoolteacher and the father of a 2-year-old and a 9-month-old. Both in the legislature and at home, Gramlich said, he’s worked toward ensuring kids are protected when they use the internet.
The Arkansas legislation he authored has a trust requirement, but it also includes other protections for child influencers, such as requiring adults to pay minors if they are using them to create content for money. For example, a minor must be paid if they or their likeness appears in at least 30% of the content produced over 30 days, or if the adult earned at least $15,000 in the previous 12 months.
The legislation also prohibits accounts from sharing “any visual depiction of a minor with the intent to sexually gratify or elicit a sexual response in the viewer or any other person.”
This goes beyond existing prohibitions on child pornography to include, for example, parents who dress their child-influencer daughters in bikinis or dance leotards for their followers — some of whom are paying a monthly fee to see that kind of content, according to an investigation by The New York Times.
Gramlich said Google helped him write the legislation. Ambrose, of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, said other social media companies have played a similar role in other states, and are establishing new policies for content featuring children.
Instagram last month announced new protections for adult-managed accounts that primarily feature children. This includes placing these accounts into a stricter category to prevent unwanted messages and turning on filters for offensive comments, according to the announcement.
Google and Meta did not grant Stateline requests for interviews.
A handful of legislators pushed back against the bill, Gramlich said, because they were concerned about putting too much responsibility on the parents. But when a parent is making an additional $15,000 a year by posting videos of their children, he said, there must be rules.
“In some ways, this is an extension of child labor protections,” Gramlich said. “We’re at the point where kids aren’t in the mines anymore, but it looks like they’re going to be on the internet. But now, their parents may be making money off their efforts, and they never get to see it.”
Social media audiences do not see the production behind online content, Gramlich said. These audiences are only seeing the finished product. And younger kids may not realize that their work is being used for money and will forever exist online, he said.
“If you’re anything like me, you’ve been told for the last 15 years that everything you put on the internet is there forever,” Gramlich said. “But can a child really understand what that means?”
The Utah legislation also goes beyond trusts. Utah Democratic state Rep. Doug Owens, the House sponsor of the bill, wanted to make sure that child influencers had the right to delete their content once they became adults. His legislation, which was signed into law by Republican Gov. Spencer Cox in March, requires that social media companies create a process for people who want their content removed or edited.
Before the legislation was drafted, two people reached out to Owens asking him to propose protections for child actors and influencers. One was a constituent — a child actor who had appeared in traditional television commercials.
The second, he said, was Kevin Franke, the ex-husband of former YouTube family vlogger Ruby Franke. In 2023, the popular YouTube star was arrested after her 12-year-old son, with duct tape stuck to his ankles and wrists, ran to a neighbor’s house and asked for food and water. She was later convicted on child abuse charges and sentenced to up to 30 years in prison.
Recent docuseries on Netflix and Hulu have revealed the ways in which kidfluencing can lead to children experiencing peer pressure, manipulation, child abuse and, in the case of the Franke family, torture.
Both the child actor and Kevin Franke said children in the entertainment industry — including kidfluencers — should have adults who are looking out for them, Owens said.
“I think social media is just an obvious place where kids need some protection,” he said.
But most state legislatures remain focused on broader social media concerns, such as age restrictions, said Georgia Democratic state Rep. Kim Schofield, who has sponsored a child influencer bill in her state.
In February, Schofield introduced a measure that would mandate trusts for child influencers. Her bill also would restrict children’s work schedules: A child between the ages of 9 and 16, for instance, would be barred from working more than five hours a day.
“I’m so excited to see that these kids are just so talented,” Schofield said. “They have a means to broaden and expand an endless universe online — I love that I get to see that. But if you’re making so much money and making the family rich, I want to make sure that you’re getting a piece of the pie.”

Study refutes widespread understanding that gray wolves, anchored by young offspring, don’t move during spring denning season.
The post Yellowstone-area wolves observed moving pups to follow elk — upending scientific assumptions appeared first on WyoFile .","Scientific research has long assumed gray wolves are non-migratory during springtime, staying anchored to tend to litters of nearly helpless pups. For the first weeks of life, after all, pups are blind, deaf and extremely vulnerable.
A game camera image captured in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, however, upends that assumption. In the picture, an adult female wolf hauls a squirmy-looking pup by its hindquarters. The collared female, GPS data shows, was transporting the youngster from a den site to a new pack “rendezvous” site — effectively relocating her young family.
The photograph is part of a study, “Wolves use diverse tactics to track partially migratory prey,” that sheds new light on the evolving dynamics between ungulates and the carnivores that prey on them. 
The study, published Aug. 1 in the journal Current Biology, finds that canids with very young pups relocate homesites if their source of prey — in this case, elk — migrate.
The research helps illuminate the ways shifting ungulate migrations can impact predator behaviors and ecosystem dynamics, said senior author Arthur Middleton, a University of California, Berkeley, professor who has spent years researching ungulate migration and conservation in Wyoming.

“It’s sort of become pretty obvious to me that [ungulate migrations are] really important to the functioning of the ecosystem,” Middleton said. “But, we’ve had work to do to show how and why, and so I think this helps add another piece of that puzzle.”
This puzzle piece relates to the ways ungulate movements can directly influence the behavior of large carnivores. “That has broader implications, I think, for how we think about the migrations and why we’re trying to conserve them and things like that,” Middleton said.  
Tracking movements
The research team set out in 2019 to learn about wolf predation in more granular detail, said co-author Avery Shawler. To do that, researchers partnered with the Wyoming Game and Fish Department to put collars on both prey — nearly 100 members of the large Cody elk herd — as well as their predators — 19 wolves belonging to seven packs. 
“So we were investigating wolf kill sites to see what they were killing and eating,” said Shawler, who completed her PhD at UC Berkeley in 2024.
This study area is east of Yellowstone National Park in the Absaroka Mountains, a rugged landscape home to high-alpine meadows, Douglas fir forests, aspen glades and sagebrush steppe. 
Over summer and winter seasons through 2021, scientists collected a great deal of data on the movement patterns of the animals, Shawler said.

That allowed researchers “to do movement analyses and compare GPS collar information,” she said. Through that, they realized “that different wolf packs have different strategies for tracking the Cody elk herd, which has individuals that migrate and individuals that don’t migrate.”
Wyoming Game and Fish game camera images helped bolster the collar observations. 
Ultimate findings demonstrated that gray wolves use diverse movement tactics to track partially migratory elk. Some Yellowstone Ecosystem elk only migrate short distances in the spring, and the wolf packs that tracked them generally stayed in the territory where they first established their dens. Other elk travel longer springtime distances, and the wolf packs that tracked them went to greater lengths to keep close. That includes packs with pups shifting homesites to follow migratory elk to summer range. Sometimes they carried small pups as far as 20 kilometers from their original dens. 
Because the highest source of wolf mortality can be attributed to members of other packs killing puppies, moving them is risky, Shawler said. 
The relocation of small pups was not a surprise to Game and Fish biologists and other large carnivore specialists, Shawler and Middleton said. Experts have observed that behavior on the ground for years. The finer-scaled detail provided by GPS collars confirmed their observations.

But, Middleton said, these findings counter years of assumptions by the larger body of animal researchers that migratory ungulates can escape predation in spring because wolves are anchored to dens and their largely immobile pups. The study is the first time researchers outside of the Arctic have observed gray wolves shifting their territorial range to be closer to prey during pup-rearing season.
The game camera photo captured it perfectly, Shawler noted. “Once they got that camera trap photo, literally of an adult wolf carrying a pup that was really, really young  … It was like, ‘Oh, they actually are moving the pups, and that’s over some really rugged terrain, over a pretty long distance.’”
Implications 
Previous work by Middleton illustrated that elk are highly variable and have the means to adapt to changing climate cues. 
This study takes that a step further, Shawler said. 
“There’s less research on how predators respond to that flexibility, and it would make sense that predators are also able to adapt,” she said. “So it’s just kind of adding to that literature.”
Understanding how wolves adapt to the prey’s behavior can help land managers better conserve both species, Middleton said. The study area, outside of Yellowstone National Park boundaries, encompasses human development like ranches and wilderness. That makes it a candidate for human-wildlife conflict.

Researchers generated a significant body of data, and Shawler is working to publish further work from it. 
Additional study co-authors include Kenneth J. Mills and Tony W. Mong of the Wyoming Game and Fish Department; Kristin J. Barker of UC Berkeley and Beyond Yellowstone Living Lab; and Wenjing Xu of the Senckenberg Biodiversity and Climate Research Centre in Germany. 
The National Geographic Society, Knobloch Family Foundation, George B. Storer Foundation, Wyoming Game and Fish Department, UC Berkeley and USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture supported the study, which was conducted from a base at the Buffalo Bill Center of the West in Cody.

In Senate hearing, critics question regional office closures, consolidation of wildland firefighting service.
The post Forest Service faces identity crisis in USDA overhaul plan. Again. appeared first on WyoFile .","This story was originally published by Mountain Journal.
The U.S. Forest Service has been searching for an identity almost since the federal government began managing trees in the 19th century.
It started in 1876 inventorying public lands to prevent over-logging. Then it became the lumber provider to the nation. Now, just shy of its 150th birthday, the Forest Service faces another fundamental reorganization announced in late July by Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins.
Or not. A week after Rollins’ announcement, the Senate Agriculture Committee ordered Deputy Agriculture Secretary Stephen Vaden to present a “Review of the USDA Reorganization Proposal.” Many public lands watchdogs hoped the hearing would clarify where the idea came from and how the Forest Service’s tree focus fit in the farm-and-ranch world of the Department of Agriculture.
During the hearing on July 30, Committee Chairman John Boozman, R-Arkansas, offered his appreciation that Vaden, who took the job just two weeks before Rollins announced the reorganization on July 24, was working on his third week when he was summoned to explain the plan.
Ranking member Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minnesota, was less welcoming.
“The reason for the short notice is because the administration put out a half-baked plan with no notice,” Klobuchar said. Rearranging a major department that had already lost 15,000 staff members at a time when tariffs and pests such as the screwworm are roiling farm markets is “nothing short of a disaster,” she said.
Sharon Friedman, former Forest Service regional planning director, called the Rollins memo “way out of the normal range of ‘things to do.’” In particular, she pointed to the proposal to phase out Forest Service regional offices, instead of shrink them from the current nine to some smaller number. Earlier this year, draft maps showing a two- or three-region compression were in circulation.
“I think Congress is going to say this is a really stupid, bad idea,” Friedman told Mountain Journal on July 29 ahead of the hearing. “Go back to the drawing board.”
The National Association of Forest Service Retirees was equally aghast.“We do not see anything in the proposal that would improve services or efficiency,” they wrote in a July 29 letter to Senate committee leaders Boozman and Klobuchar. “Rather, it appears to simply cut staffing and funding without describing how the work will continue to get done. It provides the classic direction to do more with less.”
National Association of Forest Service Retirees Chairman Steve Ellis told Mountain Journal the proposed reorganization of the Forest Service is nothing new. “I’ve been through a lot of these in my career, going back to when Jimmy Carter was in the White House,” he said. “The political ones are easy to smell, and this has the political smell to it. I doubt that it came from the Forest Service. It came from higher up. They were told, ‘Eliminate regional offices and station offices — figure it out.’”
Where to call home?
While the impact that Rollins’ reorganization plan might have on the Forest Service has drawn particular attention, it affects all 29 agencies within the Agriculture Department. Rollins told Politico on Friday that “perhaps 50 to 70% of our Washington, D.C. staff will want to move” to five new hubs the agency is creating and the rest should seek jobs in the private sector.
That amounts to about 2,600 of the 4,600 USDA staff now in Washington, D.C. offices. The department has about 100,000 employees nationwide, 90% of whom work outside the national headquarters area. 
The regional hubs would be in Raleigh, North Carolina; Kansas City, Missouri; Indianapolis, Indiana; Fort Collins, Colorado; and Salt Lake City, Utah. The memo did not say if the Forest Service regional offices would be redistributed among those five cities or eliminated altogether. 
The Forest Service has three regions serving or affecting Wyoming. The Northern Region 1 based in Missoula, Montana, oversees the Custer-Gallatin National Forest around Yellowstone National Park. It also supervises the Black Hills National Forest across the South Dakota border by Newcastle.
The Intermountain Region 4, based in Ogden, Utah, sprawls across several state borders. It oversees all of Wyoming’s Bridger-Teton National Forest, headquartered in Jackson. It also manages the Caribou-Targhee National Forest, which has offices in Pocatello and St. Anthony, Idaho, but significant impact in Wyoming.
Rocky Mountain Region 2 oversees the Bighorn National Forest, based in Sheridan, the Medicine Bow-Routt National Forest, based in Laramie, and the Shoshone National Forest, based in Cody. Region 2 also handles the Arapaho-Roosevelt National Forest, based in Fort Collins, Colorado.
Region 2’s central headquarters is in Lakewood, Colorado. Fort Collins has been proposed as one of the USDA “hubs” where some conglomeration of the agency’s 29 departments and services might be concentrated.

The overlaps matter because Forest Service regional offices typically handle federal-state projects such as Good Neighbor Authority agreements. Wyoming has had as many as 19 active GNA agreements affecting six separate national forests and two regions. Regional office planning and legal staff typically manage the National Environmental Policy Act analyses, Endangered Species Act consultations and other matters that affect multiple national forest landscapes.
Rebuilding that chain of command for those projects would have to be part of the USDA restructuring. Friedman, the former planning director, noted that similar renegotiations would have to take place for many Native American tribes that have forestry and wildlife management agreements with the Forest Service.
Vaden told senators that the plan removed some layers of middle management. “But that does not automatically mean everyone located in a former regional office of an agency will be moved,” he said. Vaden also pledged that USDA would help with moving costs for current employees, while “building the next generation of USDA leadership” in the regional hubs.
Most of Wednesday’s Senate hearing focused on two issues: Why there was so little advance notice of the plan and what senators’ districts were being considered for receiving the USDA jobs Rollins was moving out of Washington, D.C. 
Sen. John Hoeven, R-North Dakota, praised the reorganization’s goals, but warned he needed to see more collaboration with Congress.
“There’s a difference between you selecting hubs on your own and if we work together and come up with a plan,” Hoeven said. “Is this an outcome that we’re going to talk about, or a fait accompli?”
But Vaden did reveal a few expectations for the Forest Service.
Sen. Ben Jay Luján, D-New Mexico, asked about the impact of “eliminating a regional office” of the Forest Service. Vaden replied that the Forest Service’s national human resources office in Albuquerque would not be affected in the reorganization, but that “the regional office will no longer be there.” Its building is already on a federal list to be closed and sold, and its employees would “be absorbed to other areas or asked to move.”
In his testimony, Vaden said one of the biggest reasons for the organization was to get the USDA workforce out of the National Capitol Region, which has “one of the highest costs of living in the country.” Federal salaries include a “locality rate,” or pay boost, to help employees afford expensive areas. The Washington, D.C. locality rate is 33.94% above a federal job’s base pay. Federal workers with new families couldn’t afford to buy homes in the Capitol area, where prices are averaging more than $800,000, he said. 
What saves money?
“If you’re really looking for savings and belt tightening, focusing on the higher level of the organization doesn’t bother me,” said Mary Erickson, the recently retired supervisor of the Custer-Gallatin National Forest. “It’s not like you couldn’t downsize the regional offices, but the transitional costs of that are daunting. As you eliminate regional offices, where does that work go? And how do you do that in a year’s time? That’s a lot of work. And they say they don’t want to do this in fire season. Those are pretty long these days.”
Erickson pointed out that Fort Collins’ locality rate is 30.52%, resulting in almost no payroll savings. And although Salt Lake City’s locality rate is 17.06%, Utah’s public land is predominantly managed by the Department of Interior’s Bureau of Land Management, not the Forest Service.
“There’s been no explanation for those locations,” Erickson said. “No one seems to know who’s the mastermind behind this design.”
Nor does there appear to be any acknowledgement of previous federal reorganization attempts. Congress created a Special Agent in the Agriculture Department to survey the nation’s public forests in 1876, and opened a Division of Forestry in 1881. A decade later, Congress passed oversight of “forest reserves” to the Interior Department. President Theodore Roosevelt moved it back to Agriculture in 1905, naming Gifford Pinchot the first chief of the Forest Service.

An official history of the Forest Service’s first century labels eight more evolutions, including “The War Years,” “Environmentalism/Public Participation Era” and “Ecosystem Management and the Future Era.” 
Ellis recalled the attempt at slimming down the BLM during the Clinton administration.
“They decided to take the district office layer out, which is like removing the forest supervisor layer in the National Forest System,” Ellis said. “It ended up costing a lot of money to move people around and get out of office leases. It ended up being a total flop. When the second Bush administration came on, they quietly put that layer back in.”
The first Trump administration took a similar track in 2019 when it moved the BLM headquarters out of Washington, D.C. Staff were dispersed to new offices in Colorado, Nevada, Utah and several other bases.
A 2021 survey of BLM workers by Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility reported that 87% of reassigned employees either retired or quit rather than move. The field offices were staffed largely by new hires who lacked the scientific or experiential backgrounds of the former staff. “This lack of expertise in new hires has resulted in a shunning of science at the agency, and even a demonization of intellectual culture in some cases,” the PEER report stated.
It also resulted in a paucity of workers handling public business. At the time, the Utah area reported an average of one BLM employee for every 37,277 acres of public land. Arches National Park, which is surrounded by BLM lands, had one employee for every 1,530 acres.
Biden administration Interior Secretary Tracy Stone-Manning moved much of the BLM headquarters staff back to Washington in 2022. But she also reinforced the Colorado office, expanding its contingent from 27 positions under Trump to 56.
Friedman now runs the forestry policy blog Smokey Wire. She was a planning director in 2007 when a “Transformation Team” explored ways of performing Forest Service duties better. But Friedman noted her own inability to find out what it actually accomplished: “I couldn’t find any documentation for the effort. It wasn’t even clear whom I would ask at the Forest Service. Historian? Archivist? I got some phone numbers and emails, but no one returned the messages.”
Some of that effort looked into moving the Forest Service from Agriculture to Interior. A 2009 Government Accountability Office report concluded “a move would provide few efficiencies in the short term and could diminish the role the Forest Service plays in state and private land management … [If] the objective of a move is to improve land management and increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the agencies’ diverse programs, other options might achieve better results.”
The 2009 GAO report also cataloged other past consolidation initiatives. One was the colocation of wildland firefighting experts from the Forest Service, BLM, Fish and Wildlife Service, National Park Service and Bureau of Indian Affairs to create the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho. That took place in 1965.
Where’s the fire?
One particular problem drags public lands management off balance: wildfire.
While logging trees and grazing cows and digging trail occur far from the average American’s attention, forest fires are literally front-page news. The Forest Service routinely spends nearly half its annual budget fighting fire. It handles between 70 and 80% of the public land ignitions, with Interior agencies such as the Bureau of Land Management chasing most of the rest.
Federal firefighters have long chaffed at being just a tool in a larger agency’s land management toolbox, according to Freidman.
“There’s a tension between wildfire people and everybody else,” she said. “They got pay raises and nobody else did. They want to work for other wildfire people, because they feel they’re a national asset. They think they shouldn’t have others holding them back when they could be making money.”

But wildfire and public land management are woven together in a tight braid. Fire-dependent ecosystems cover most of the western United States. Local ranger districts not only map and monitor their surrounding forest for fire potential, their staffs often donate their time to the community volunteer fire department and ambulance service.
Removing fire duties from the Forest Service would “hollow out” the agency, according to Ellis.
“Fire is integrated in every program the Forest Service does,” he said. “Anything you do on public lands affects the fuel. It isn’t just burning slash piles. It’s how you graze range land. It’s timber harvest. That’s all fuels management. The fuel in Los Angeles fires [last January] was homes.”
During the hearing, Sen. Klobuchar asked if there was a bigger plan to move the Forest Service, or parts of it, to some other cabinet agency. She particularly wanted to know about the fate of wildland firefighting.
Vaden replied that the president’s budget, not the reorganization plan, called for the centralization of wildfire services. In other responses, Vaden said the Missoula-based Fire Lab would not be moving, and that the Salt Lake City regional hub was chosen in part because it offered “aviation assets” that would help the Forest Service in the “administration’s plan regarding centralizing wildfire efforts.”
Congress had already shown resistance to other Trump administration moves. Last week, both the House and Senate Appropriations committees rejected a plan to wrap the Forest Service’s firefighting duties into a new wildland fire management service housed in the Interior Department. Despite a Trump executive order creating the consolidated wildfire service and Forest Service and Interior budget reports detailing how it would work, congressional budgeters put the 2026 wildfire allocations back in their traditional multiagency bankbooks.
“The committee is disappointed with the utter lack of regard for complying with Congressional intent on spending funds as appropriated,” the Senate Appropriations Committee bill report stated. On other pages, the Senate committee overruled Trump’s order changing the name of North America’s highest mountain from Denali to McKinley. And it blocked an Interior Department plan to hand over some unnamed small national park facilities to state management.
“Over my whole career, the president’s budget, if you took it as reality, was completely drastic,” Erickson said. “We always expected it was going to be moderated by the Congressional process. Up to this point with Trump, you hadn’t seen that. Maybe we’re seeing some good signs there.”

But in a new twist, the Trump administration has begun using an unexpected legal tactic in its deportation efforts. Rather than pursue a deportation case, it is convincing judges to dismiss immigrants’ cases — thus depriving the immigrants of protection from arrest and detention — then taking them into custody.
The practice, affecting immigrants released at the border and given a “notice to appear” in court under both the Trump and Biden administrations, sometimes leads to people being quickly deported by Immigration and Customs Enforcement through a process called expedited removal.
Many of the immigrants had requested asylum, as allowed under U.S. law. Late last month, advocates filed a lawsuit on behalf of a dozen immigrants unexpectedly arrested by ICE, often after having their cases dismissed.
When an immigrant crosses the border illegally and is caught, they may be given a “notice to appear,” or NTA, ordering them to appear before an immigration judge. It can sometimes take years, however, before their case comes up.
One of the immigrants in the lawsuit was caught at the border with Mexico and given a court appearance ticket in 2022 after fleeing Cuba. His opposition to forced conscription and the communist government in Cuba led to his arrest there and he was raped in custody, according to the lawsuit.
At his first hearing in U.S. immigration court in May, his case was dismissed with no reason given and his attorney agreed, thinking the relatively new maneuver was a positive development.
But as he left the Miami court, the immigrant was arrested and sent to Washington state for detention, thousands of miles from his family and his wife, who is a U.S. citizen, according to the lawsuit.
“The aftermath of these courthouse arrests and dismissals for placement in expedited removal wreaks further havoc on people’s lives,” according to a class-action lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Justice filed in July by a group of immigrant advocates. The group argued the practice is illegal and contrary to the traditional way people are treated when released at the border for court dates.
The lawsuit includes 12 immigrants: three from Cuba, three from Venezuela, two from Ecuador, two from Guinea and others from Liberia and the Chechen Republic. A Department of Justice spokesperson, Natalie Baldassarre, said the department had no comment on the lawsuit.
After a courthouse arrest in New York City in July, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told CBS News that the new policy “is reversing [President Joe] Biden’s catch and release policy that allowed millions of unvetted illegal aliens to be let loose on American streets.”
However, the Trump administration has also released immigrants seeking asylum at the border pending court dates, according to a June 27 report from the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC) at the University of Syracuse, an organization that tracks federal statistics.
Almost 18,000 people were released at the border in May “even after Trump officials closed the border, vowed not to allow anyone in and to immediately detain anyone not legally in the country caught inside the U.S.,” the report stated.
Other immigration attorneys who spoke with Stateline described uprooted lives caused by the new practice of arresting people after they show up for court hearings, but the attorneys declined to speak on the record for fear of drawing negative attention to their clients’ cases.
Vanessa Dojaquez-Torres, practice and policy counsel for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, which represents more than 17,000 immigration attorneys and is not involved in the lawsuit, said the Department of Homeland Security is now arguing in court that anyone caught crossing the border should be arrested and detained, though it’s not happening in every case.
“There is a large number of people going to court and getting arrested, and also people in detention not getting let out,” Dojaquez-Torres said. “This happens to people with no criminal background, no negative immigration history — they might even have a sponsor that says, ‘We will house them and feed them and make sure they show up to their court hearings.’”
There are also cases of people arrested in court even if their case isn’t dismissed, Dojaquez-Torres said.
One of the immigrants in the lawsuit, a Venezuelan who said he faced persecution in his home country as a gay man with HIV, was arrested July 1 after a hearing in New York City even though his case is still active, according to the lawsuit.
One woman born in Venezuela, who fears persecution because of her sexual orientation and opposition to the Venezuelan government, applied for asylum within a year of entering the United States in 2022, but was arrested at her first court hearing May 27. She now faces an expedited removal order, which could mean an immediate deportation if she loses appeals. She is currently in detention in Ohio, according to the lawsuit.
Other cases mentioned in the lawsuit involved arrests at immigration courts in Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota and Nevada.

Most of the immigrants mentioned in the lawsuit were caught crossing illegally. But two presented themselves at the border legally via an appointment set up through a phone app for asylum-seekers, CBP One, designed to limit the number of people who could cross the border asking for asylum. (The Trump administration shut down the app on its first day in office.)
In one of those cases, a gay man from Ecuador, facing government threats over his LGBTQ+ advocacy efforts, used the app in January and appeared in court June 4, according to the lawsuit.
The government moved to dismiss his case, and he was deported back to Ecuador within a month, despite asking for more time to file an asylum case, according to the suit. He is now living in hiding.
The class-action lawsuit has not yet been answered by the government, though the chief judge of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, James Boasberg, ruled July 18 that the immigrants suing could use pseudonyms without identifying information as long as they provide real names and addresses in documents sealed from public view.
Courthouse arrests may cross a new line legally but they’re not likely to increase deportation significantly the way current large-scale workplace raids and transfers from local jails might, said Muzaffar Chishti, an attorney and policy expert at the Migration Policy Institute, a Washington, D.C., think tank. The administration’s goal of 1 million deportations a year still seems unlikely, he said.
Arrests declined in July over the previous month, but deportations increased, according to an Aug. 2 TRAC report, with 56,945 people in detention. The number of detainees will increase with more federal funding for detention, but is still unlikely to reach the level needed to deport a million people in a year, Chishti said.
The issue of courthouse arrests makes legal representation for immigrants all the more important, Chishti said.
“Even in these horrendous cases, if you have a lawyer, he’ll know how to handle it and say, ‘He can’t be removed, he’ll be subject to torture,’” Chishti said. “The difference between arrest and deportation could be the presence of a lawyer.”
Nevertheless, the prospect of arrest and detention during a case that may last years could make immigrants hesitant to show up for court dates, which in turn could make them subject to immediate deportation.
“If you don’t show up for a court date, they will enter what’s called an in absentia removal order. If you come into any contact with ICE after that, you will be most likely detained and removed,” Dojaquez-Torres said.

(Rebecca S. Gratz for the Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A program meant to offer state resources to Nebraska children suspected of being abused or neglected while keeping more of them at home and out of foster care is not being used as intended, an inspector general’s report alleges. 
The Office of Inspector General for Child Welfare began investigating the state’s Alternative Response (AR) program after it received nine notices between 2021 and 2024 of children having suffered serious injuries and three of them dying within months of their families being assessed through the program, which is manned by the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services.

AR, according to the report, is recognized as a best practice in more than 20 states. It is used as a less adversarial and more collaborative method of working with children and families to assess possible cases of child endangerment while keeping more children with their families. 
Though AR is meant to be used for mid- to low-risk cases, the report found nearly half of the families DHHS assessed were deemed to be high-risk or worse of future mistreatment. The OIG report notes that between 2021-2024, DHHS completed AR assessments for more than 17,000 families, and over 7,800 of them qualified as high or very high risk. 
AR was implemented as a pilot program in Nebraska in 2014. It was added as a permanent program in 2020. Inspector General Jennifer Carter noted that during its pilot years, there were no reported cases of serious injuries or deaths related to AR assessments. The reports of kids getting harmed started after the program became permanent, which is part of what prompted the investigation, Carter said. 
In a written response included in the report, DHHS Director of Children and Family Services Alyssa Bish argued current regulations don’t mandate how AR cases should be assigned based on risk level and noted that cases are excluded from AR when a child is determined to be unsafe. 
The OIG report confirmed that DHHS has not broken the law.

Bish explained that “safety” and “risk” are two separate measurements. Safety is an immediate assessment based on active threats of serious harm to the child, while risk is a more long-term evaluation of potential for future harm. 
“It is important to clarify that the level of risk can only be evaluated after an intake is determined to be eligible for AR and the assigned Children and Family Services Specialist has made contact with the family,” Bish wrote. 
Carter’s report criticized multiple deficiencies found in DHHS’ AR process, noting multiple errors found within the assessments of the nine cases the Inspector General’s Office reviewed in depth. 
The report also raised concerns about DHHS’ “limited review” of each family’s history when assigning AR cases. In more than one of the nine reviewed cases, reports of suspected abuse within the family were missed, including at least one in which the OIG said there had been a report of abuse filed within the family nine months before the AR assessment. 
“A family could have extensive previous intakes over many years that indicate a pattern of concerning behavior that [is] not considered if outside that six-month window,” Carter argued. 
The OIG report makes several recommendations, including that DHHS improve its data tracking and find ways to encourage families to more easily engage more with state resources. Of the nine cases, a majority of families declined DHHS resources after receiving an AR assessment. 
“It is impossible to say that AR services being provided would have stopped the incidents from occurring in those cases,” Carter wrote in the report. “But in AR cases, unlike court-involved cases, engaging the family during the AR assessment is the only way to provide the family with the supports they need to address concerns in the home.”
Carter praised DHHS for enhancing its data tracking system in February to include a note when families decline state services, calling it “a great step.” She suggested DHHS ought to align its data on AR with HHS data on the agency’s more common Traditional Response method to alleged abuse or neglect. The goal: to be able to compare the effectiveness of each program under certain circumstances. 
Bish noted multiple updates DHHS has made to its AR system before the OIG report came out, including a new tool that reviews the frequency and quality of contact with families within the program. However, Bish noted that this tool does not evaluate families’ level of engagement with state resources for families. 
“DHHS acknowledges the importance of this recommendation and is open to further exploration and development of metrics or tools that could more explicitly assess engagement outcomes,” Bish wrote. 
Carter emphasized that despite her critiques, Alternative Response remains a useful tool that can recognize nuanced cases, such as families in poverty that could be mistaken as neglectful. 
However, she argued that more attention should be paid to the outcomes of families assessed under AR and suggested DHHS and the Nebraska Legislature should consider whether risk level of future abuse or neglect should be a factor in assigning AR cases. 
DHHS did not respond to requests for additional comment on the report.

The declines continue a trend seen since crime surged during the COVID-19 pandemic, when homicides jumped nearly 30% in 2020 — one of the largest one-year increases since the FBI began keeping records in 1930. By 2022, violent crime had fallen close to pre-pandemic levels.
Homicides, which the FBI classifies as murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, dropped nearly 15% in 2024. Reports of other violent offenses also decreased, including rape by 5.2%, robbery by 8.9% and aggravated assault by 3%.

Property crime also fell across all major categories, with motor vehicle theft down 18.6%, burglary down 8.6% and larceny-theft down 5.5%. Reported hate crimes decreased 1.5% from the previous year.
The 2024 report draws on submissions from 16,675 law enforcement agencies — 2.1% more than last year — representing more than 95% of the U.S. population. Every city agency serving a population of 1 million or more people provided a full year of data. Participation in the FBI’s crime data collection is voluntary, and the data is based on crimes reported to police.
About 75% of participating agencies submitted information through the FBI’s new, more detailed National Incident-Based Reporting System, or NIBRS, which covered 87% of the population.
The data release marks a shift from recent years when participation lagged following the FBI’s 2021 transition to the new system, which required many law enforcement agencies to invest in training and technology upgrades. In 2021, national reporting rates fell below 70% for the first time in two decades, forcing the FBI to estimate results for many jurisdictions.
The FBI’s crime trends report also includes new law enforcement safety data. Sixty-four officers were feloniously killed in the line of duty in 2024, 43 officers were accidentally killed and 85,730 officers were assaulted.
Although the FBI’s 2024 report is a year behind, it aligns with other crime trend reports. The Council on Criminal Justice, a nonpartisan think tank, recently found that homicides and other serious offenses, including gun assaults and carjackings, fell in the first half of 2025 across 42 major cities compared to the same period in 2024.

Marsha Blackburn. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn holds a significant lead over U.S. Rep. John Rose in the 2026 Republican primary for Tennessee governor, according to a poll released by the conservative think tank Beacon Center. 
The Beacon poll gives Blackburn a 68% to 14% advantage among the 571 Republican voters the group polled from July 27 to August 1. 
The poll was conducted before Blackburn officially announced her campaign at the start of August. Rose entered the campaign in March.
Early polling leads aren’t always an indication of who will win.
When Gov. Bill Lee ran in a five-person Republican primary in 2018, he trailed in polling until the campaign’s final weeks. 
A March 2018 poll conducted by the Washington, D.C.-based Save the Children Action Network, showed Lee with 7% support, trailing two other Republicans with 20% support each. 
Lee is term-limited and can’t run for reelection.

Blackburn has higher name recognition than Rose, who represents a U.S. Congressional district covering parts of middle and east Tennessee, after winning two statewide elections to the U.S. Senate. She’s also a close ally of President Donald Trump, who has not made an endorsement in the race yet. 
Shortly after her 2024 reelection to the Senate, Blackburn was rumored to be interested in running for governor. But she has waited nearly a year, allowing her to use her federal campaign funds for advertisements and to travel the state using that money.
Now that she’s officially entered the race, Blackburn can’t use federal campaign funds in the governor’s race as federal campaign finance laws prohibit the comingling of funds for state and federal races. 
Rose has shown he’s willing to put his personal funds, loaning his campaign $5 million. 
In 2018, the last time there was an open primary for Tennessee’s governor, the candidates spent almost $50 million. 
Memphis City Council member Jerri Green is the only Democrat to announce a candidacy in the Democratic primary.

(Courtesy of the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife)In an amazing court victory for wild wolves and advocates who tirelessly speak on their behalf, the federal district court in Missoula, Montana, ruled that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service violated the Endangered Species Act when it determined that gray wolves in the Western United States do not warrant federal protections.
Western Watersheds Project, Alliance for the Wild Rockies, WildEarth Guardians, International Wildlife Coexistence Network, Predator Defense, Protect the Wolves, Trap Free Montana, Wilderness Watch, Friends of the Clearwater, and Nimiipuu Protecting the Environment filed a lawsuit in January challenging the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s denial of their petitions to list a Western U.S. distinct population segment of gray wolves under the Endangered Species Act, or alternatively, to re-list the Northern Rocky Mountain distinct population segment, which Congress “delisted” in 2011.
Federal court overturns decision denying Endangered Species protections to wolves

The ruling means that the Fish and Wildlife Service’s finding that gray wolves in the West do not qualify for listing is vacated and sent back to the agency for a new decision, consistent with the Endangered Species Act and best available science.
We hope this order will help blunt some of the lingering bigotry, senseless killing and fear mongering that nearly wiped wolves out before they were listed as endangered under the provisions of the federal Endangered Species Act in 1974.
Wolves remain under state control in Idaho following legal victory for conservationists 

The court order states that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service failed to consider the “best available science” on wolf populations and the impacts of hunting and trapping; the full extent of the species’ historical range; and the threat posed by inadequate state and federal regulations that often bow to political pressure.
The court ordered the Fish and Wildlife Service to re-analyze threats to the gray wolf population in the West in accordance with the requirements of the Endangered Species Act. These include the requirement to use the best available science.
Specifically, the court noted the agency failed to consider wolves’ lost historic range throughout the West in its assessment.
The court also ruled that the Fish and Wildlife Service  failed to apply the best available science on population estimates and genetic threats from their small population size; incorrectly assumed connectivity among wolves in the West would continue despite high levels of mortality in the Northern Rockies.
To sum it up, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service didn’t follow the law to protect wolves from Montana’s, Idaho’s, and Wyoming’s wolf extermination policies. Wolves have yet to recover across the West, and allowing a few states to undertake aggressive wolf slaughters is inconsistent with the law.
The Alliance successfully sued to overturn the delisting of the gray wolf in 2012, but Montana’s Democratic Sen. Jon Tester broke his campaign promise to not use riders to overturn court decisions and attached a rider to a must-pass Defense appropriation bill to remove wolves from Endangered Species list despite the court’s order. It is time to once again manage wolves in the Northern Rockies and throughout the west based on science, not politics, since Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming have demonstrated that they are not capable of doing so.
I would like to thank Matt Bishop, an attorney at Western Environmental Law Center for representing us and winning.

But right now Michigan’s kids are being exposed to increased political polarization, growing ideological extremism and high levels of political violence.
Although extremism and political violence are not new, virtual platforms allow fringe beliefs and hateful ideas to gain traction, particularly with young people. Kids encounter a huge amount of supremacist ideologies in virtual forums, gaming platforms and social media, where racist, anti-LGBT, antisemitic and misogynistic content thrive.
According to a 2023 Gallup Poll, teens report using social media on average 4.8 hours a day, a trend that is not only linked to negative effects on physical and mental health but also exposes teens to hate-based content. Although social media can offer many benefits to teen mental health – including through opportunities for connection, creativity and identity development – many social media platforms use algorithms to target harmful, hate-based content to vulnerable young people. 
The targeting of misogynistic content to adolescent boys has been especially well-documented. Gaming chats have become notorious for the sexist attitudes that prevail there, including both misogynistic and anti-LGBTQ+ ideas, while popular male lifestyle influencers play into the male loneliness epidemic while advocating violence against women and downplaying sexual violence.

These kinds of messages risk normalizing everyday harassment and violence against girls and nonbinary kids. According to the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, 13.8% of high school students in Michigan reported experiencing sexual violence, a 21% increase from 2017 to 2023. Reports of sexual violence are even higher for girls and students identifying as LGBTQ+.
But hate is not only spread online. Political extremism is becoming more commonplace and puts vulnerable populations at risk. Research from the Southern Poverty Law Center shows Michigan is home to 34 hate and anti-government extremist groups, making our communities less safe for Black people, women, immigrants, Jewish people, Muslims and LGBTQ+ people. 
Just five years ago, members of one such anti-government extremist group were indicted in a plot to kidnap the governor that occurred following a relentless online disinformation campaign fueled by sexism. More recently, a politically motivated assassin took the lives of a Minnesota lawmaker and her husband. 
Increasing polarization and ideological extremism makes it difficult for our leaders to do their jobs and keep our public institutions working. From 2022 to 2024, Michigan has seen 80 incidents of public officials facing threats and harassment – including doxing, stalking and death threats – in the course of their work as civil servants.
In a recent survey conducted by the Bridging Divides Institute and CivicPulse, 36% of school board officials reported experiencing hostility in 2024. This hostility does not just harm school leaders, but can also create an unwelcoming environment for students, especially if the hostility centers around the politicization of a child’s identity.
It’s time for us to lower the temperature. We can demonstrate the values we want kids today to take into adulthood, whether that means lawmakers reaching across the aisle or neighbors working together to better their community. We can all find things to agree on when we listen with curiosity and set aside the defensiveness. 
Some legislators are already making efforts to reduce tensions and build relationships. State Reps. Brenda Carter and Greg Markkanen became the first lawmakers to invite each other to visit their districts as part of the inaugural Michigan Legislative Exchange Project, which seeks to strengthen understanding and cooperation between lawmakers in Michigan. 
We also need to address the role of online platforms in allowing misogyny, disinformation and extremism to flourish. A Stanford University study found a majority of middle school students surveyed could not evaluate the credibility of online content, demonstrating the need to equip young people with the tools to identify misinformation. 
Social media platforms have become essential tools for promoting democracy and civic engagement, but they also lack the guardrails to prevent the spread of conspiracy theories and the promotion of violent extremism. If we want kids today to grow up in communities free of threats, harassment and violence, it’s up to us to create them.
The Michigan League for Public Policy’s Kids Count in Michigan project and the team of people behind it believe all kids deserve this and more. Kids deserve to grow up in a state that offers belonging, economic security, a world class education, access to health care, and thriving families and communities.

One morning in February 2023, a small group of mineral owners arrived at the North Dakota Capitol on a mission. They had traveled from across the state and other parts of the country to explain to lawmakers how the powerful oil and gas companies had been chipping away at their income.
It’s not easy to recruit people to testify during the winter months of the legislative session. Ranchers are busy with the calving season. Snowbirds have relocated to warmer climates. It’s a more than three-hour drive for those living in the Bakken oil field. 

This is the second story in a series. Read the first story here.

But those who made it to Bismarck lined up at a podium to share details of their own experiences and the broader concerns affecting the estimated 300,000 people who receive money from the industry in exchange for the right to their underground minerals. For nearly a decade, they had grappled with companies withholding significant portions of their royalty payments without explaining how they determined how much to deduct, as the North Dakota Monitor and ProPublica reported last week. 
Now they were at the Capitol for a specific reason: They wanted legislators to require companies to provide more information so owners could discern if they were being paid correctly, and to impose penalties if companies failed to comply. 
Shane Leverenz, who manages income his extended family receives from numerous oil wells, read aloud email responses from companies to illustrate the lack of cooperation mineral owners face when they request information. “We are not obligated to mail each owner a calculation as to how their interest was calculated,” one company wrote. 
“There is no transparency,” Leverenz told the legislators. Leverenz, whose great-grandfather homesteaded in North Dakota and had his property deed signed by President Theodore Roosevelt, has helped organize royalty owners on this issue in recent years. Leverenz grew up in Epping, a town of fewer than 100 people in the northwest part of the state, and traveled to North Dakota from Texas, where he now lives, to testify.

After input from Leverenz and others, lawmakers decided to create a new state program that they hoped would address conflicts between royalty owners and companies. In particular, mineral owners had mounting concerns over postproduction deductions, the money companies withhold to cover the costs of processing and transporting minerals after they are extracted and before they are sold. Companies say they are allowed to pass on a share of those costs, while royalty owners say they shouldn’t bear that responsibility because in most cases lease agreements don’t mention those expenses. 
The state’s “postproduction royalty oversight program” had the support of the industry, but it was far less than what Leverenz and other owners wanted. In the two years since its creation, the program has not lived up to its name and has not alleviated owners’ concerns over deductions or transparency, an investigation by the North Dakota Monitor and ProPublica found. The program has resolved 69 cases so far, and none have involved postproduction deductions, according to documents obtained under a public records request. A case can represent a complaint or question from a royalty owner.
“The legislative intent was supposed to be addressing the issue of the postproduction costs that they were hitting people with,” said Rep. Don Longmuir, a Republican from Stanley, in the northwest corner of the state. 
The newsrooms’ investigation found that the program has focused on other issues. It has instead helped owners resolve complaints about companies withholding payments entirely and failing to pay interest on late royalty payments, records show. Some mineral owners said in interviews that they do not trust state officials to help them get information about the deductions and therefore have not tried to use the program.  
Leverenz said the program, also referred to as the ombudsman program, has not accomplished what he and other royalty owners were told it would. He has taken six complaints to the ombudsman; three were resolved but three remain open, including two for more than a year. The unresolved complaints do not involve deductions, he said, and focus on other issues with his family’s royalty payments. 
“The ombudsman is running into the same thing that I have, where there’s just no response from the oil companies or they stalled,” Leverenz said. “There’s been no forward momentum.”
Ron Webb, who coordinates the program within the state’s Department of Agriculture, said it has helped facilitate communication between mineral owners and companies. He said the program is voluntary and does not have authority to compel companies to change how they calculate payments or even to provide information. “Oil companies are not required to work with us,” Webb said.
The program no longer promotes itself as being able to oversee concerns about royalty deductions even though that was part of the legislative intent. On the department’s website and in a brochure, the word “postproduction” has been dropped from the program’s name even though it is in the title of the law that created it.
The department’s legal counsel, Dutch Bialke, said the name of the law is irrelevant to how the program operates.
“The title is entirely legally non-binding and has no legal effect,” he wrote in an email, citing North Dakota law. 
  A bill introduced in 2023 established what it called the postproduction royalty oversight program. The program has since dropped the word “postproduction” from its name. (Obtained by North Dakota Monitor and ProPublica. Highlighted by ProPublica.)
‘Nothing is clear’ 
Ever since Neil Christensen and his sisters noticed in 2016 that Hess Corp. was withholding nearly 25% of their royalty income — up from less than 1% just two years earlier — his family has tried to get answers from the company. 
He traveled to Minot, North Dakota, some years ago to meet with Hess representatives at their production offices. He also called the company’s accounting office and its royalty owner hotline, but he said their explanations didn’t make sense. 
“It doesn’t seem as if the company has a large interest in explaining themselves,” Christensen said. Spreadsheets kept by his family show withholdings have been as much as 42% in recent years. “The transparency issue is a big problem with oil operators and mineral owners.”

The royalty statements can be hundreds of pages long but provide only a general description of the reasons for the deductions, leaving owners unable to verify the companies’ costs and whether they are being paid a fair share. Christensen’s family and others said they have had payments reduced for expenses the companies incurred years earlier.
“Nothing is clear,” said his sister Naomi Staruch, who has spent most of her career working in finance for banks and churches in Minnesota. “I would get so frustrated really looking hard at the statements.” 
Diana and Bob Skarphol, who have advocated for years on behalf of royalty owners, said confusing and overwhelming royalty statements are a common concern. The couple received one statement last year that included 39 pages of calculations for a single well — including reductions to past royalties going back nine years. The Skarphols received $1.15 that month from the production of the well.
Merrill Piepkorn, a Democratic former state senator from Fargo who was the prime sponsor of the transparency legislation, said oil companies’ tactics are “obfuscation through transparency.” 
“You get so much information, there’s no way to find what you’re looking for,” said Piepkorn, who unsuccessfully ran for governor in 2024. 
Todd Slawson, chair of the North Dakota Petroleum Council, said royalty statements are complex in part because state regulators within the last decade began requiring companies to include additional categories of information. Hess said it maintains an online portal where royalty owners can access their royalty information and operates a call center that mineral owners can contact with questions. 
North Dakota does not regulate the costs that companies can pass on to individual owners, though the state and federal governments regulate deductions on government-owned land. The state audits the royalties paid on state-owned minerals to ensure the amounts are correct and, since 1979, the state’s leases do not allow deductions. But private mineral owners don’t have that same access and often learn about deductions by comparing their statements with one another. 
“It’s kind of all rigged against the individual royalty owner,” Leverenz said.

State officials have told mineral owners that they can’t get involved in private disputes and that litigation is the owners’ best recourse. But litigation isn’t financially feasible for most families, according to attorney Josh Swanson, who represents mineral owners.
“It easily exceeds six figures, and that’s cost-prohibitive for most folks,” Swanson said. “Part of the playbook for a lot of operators is making these things as cost-prohibitive as they can.”
Swanson was the attorney Janice Arnson and her family hired to try to get answers from Hess. Hess had been deducting between 15% and 36% of their royalty income each month since 2015, according to a spreadsheet maintained by Arnson. They had no luck getting an explanation from the company until they hired Swanson in 2017. When Hess responded, a company attorney said in a letter that the deductions were “proper and permissible” under the terms of the lease. While Swanson disagreed, the family declined to pursue litigation because “it was going to be an expensive suit.”

“We were one small, little family,” said Arnson. “We just didn’t have the resources against Hess to fight.”
(Hess did not contest or comment on Arnson’s or Christensen’s claims.)
Some royalty owners have turned to the Northwest Landowners Association, a nonprofit advocacy group, for help. Troy Coons, the group’s chair, said he has fielded multiple calls a week from royalty owners who are angry that state leaders have not helped them with the deductions. “It’s a massive concern for people,” said Coons, whose group has sued the state on behalf of property owners on a different issue. “We’re not supposed to be bearing the burden of expenses.”

Lawmakers initially had bipartisan support in 2023 for a bill that would have guaranteed mineral owners access to electronic spreadsheets detailing their payments and would have required companies to provide more information on how they calculate a royalty owner’s share of the income from each well. It also would have directed courts to require companies to reimburse royalty owners for attorneys’ fees if they successfully sued for the information. 
But that bill was discarded in favor of legislation creating the royalty oversight program. 
The Legislature “took our bill and they stripped it of everything, and they shoved the ombudsman program into it,” Leverenz said. They created the program “with the promises that, you know, this is going to be the answer to all the issues that have been brought up over the years with the royalty owners.”
Sen. Brad Bekkedahl, a Republican from Williston, initially backed both bills. The senator said he hoped the bill creating the ombudsman program would be amended in the legislative process to give it more authority to advocate on behalf of mineral owners. That didn’t happen.  
“That would have been, I think, more beneficial to royalty owners,” said Bekkedahl, who ultimately voted against it.

‘Barking up a tree’ 
In pitching the program to lawmakers in 2023, Doug Goehring, the state’s agriculture commissioner, said the goal was to “try to develop some resolution” for royalty owners with questions about their payments, including concerns over deductions.
The bill required a report to legislators. Goehring told lawmakers he would share with them “full and complete information concerning the cases” handled by the program and the issues faced by mineral owners in order to inform future legislation. “We’ll certainly provide you scenarios, situations, and some of the challenges and difficulties we’ve dealt with,” Goehring, a Republican, testified in 2023. “And even some suggestions about how you correct some of this moving forward.” 
The result has fallen short of what Goehring pledged in testimony, the news organizations found. Goehring now says it is not the program’s job to find resolution for royalty owners who question the deductions. “We don’t have a leg to stand on to try and advocate or try to extort money out of the company,” Goehring said. He said an exception is if deductions are specifically prohibited in leases, but most agreements, especially those signed decades ago, are silent on the issue of deductions.
Instead of a detailed report, Goehring delivered a one-page summary to legislators in September that broadly categorized the issues handled through the program. Legislators accepted the report without discussion. Goehring said a more detailed report was not necessary. “They don’t want to know that,” he said. “We generally don’t write reports in that manner. We give them the basic information.”

Of the 147 cases filed with the program, about half remain unresolved, including more than two dozen that have been pending since 2023. Goehring said some of the cases remain open at the request of royalty owners.
Two of the pending cases involve postproduction deductions, including one that has been open since September 2023, according to Bialke, the Agriculture Department’s legal counsel.
The cases are assigned to two energy companies that serve as ombudsmen, Diamond Resources and Aurora Energy Solutions, which contact the companies on behalf of the mineral owners. Neither of the companies responded to questions from the North Dakota Monitor and ProPublica. 
The news organizations paid $425 to obtain records related to the cases that had been resolved as of late June. In those cases, the ombudsmen have answered royalty owners’ questions and obtained answers for them when companies had not been responsive. In some cases, they mediated solutions that resulted in royalty owners receiving payments they were owed, records show. 
In one case, an ombudsman spent nearly 10 months going back and forth with a company until the royalty owner got paid. In other cases, ombudsmen helped royalty owners understand technical issues related to taxes and the probate process after inheriting minerals. The department redacted company names from the documents released, with Bialke citing state law.
“It has been extremely helpful for frustrated royalty owners who cannot get their questions answered,” said Slawson of the North Dakota Petroleum Council, who also owns an energy company. “Having deductions suddenly show up on revenue checks and questions not being answered or not explained well can lead to suspicions of wrongdoing.”
North Dakota mineral owners say oil companies unfairly keep millions from checks without oversight

Kenneth Schmidt, who owns minerals near Ray in Williams County, contacted the program after struggling to convince a company that it owed interest on late royalty payments as mandated by state law. It took a few months, he said, but the company paid him.
“I was very satisfied with the program,” said Schmidt. “Instead of going to an attorney and I’ll pay $400 an hour, they did it for free, but through the state.”
Goehring said the program has been successful, citing feedback from the industry as well as the fact that no bills related to royalty deductions were introduced during this year’s legislative session, the first time in nearly a decade.
“If there’s no bills that are coming up, then isn’t that an indication? It’s kind of like if you don’t have a cough, then maybe you don’t have a cold,” he said.
While the program has resolved disputes like Schmidt’s, which are more cut-and-dried, it isn’t well equipped to handle more complex disagreements, Goehring said. That isn’t a surprise to one of the lawmakers who worked on the bill. 
“I don’t doubt that in some cases, facilitating that communication probably helped, but I don’t think it gives all the answers to the royalty owners that they’re looking for,” Bekkedahl said.
A number of royalty owners told the news organizations they simply don’t trust the program to help. “I didn’t feel the ombudsman program had any teeth in it whatsoever to do anything,” said Brian Anderson, who has not filed a complaint even though he wants companies to more fully explain their deductions. “They’ll placate you; they’re not going to do anything about it.”
Curtis Trulson, a royalty owner in Mountrail County, agreed: Going to the program, he said, is just “barking up a tree.”

And she is curious: Wouldn’t Nebraska fans be game for taking a train to see a Husker football game? An Omaha concert? A Grand Island museum? 
Starting Aug. 19 in Columbus, Juarez and ProRail Nebraska advocates are kicking off a statewide series of five  town halls to gauge the interest Nebraskans have in passenger rail options. 
The feedback is for a legislative interim study also evaluating existing passenger rail infrastructure in Nebraska — which sponsors say could lead to legislation proposing ways to create easier commutes between Nebraska cities.  
 Nebraska ‘far behind’

Juarez said her hope is for a frequent and steady Omaha-Lincoln route, but she also sees potential for better connection from western Nebraska to the state’s capital city of Lincoln or to its largest city, Omaha.
“Transportation is a priority in our state, and I’m disappointed in the lack of progress we’ve made,” she said. “I want communities across Nebraska to see what a great asset passenger rail can be.”
 

Town hall schedule
(Times are 6 p.m. to 7:30 p.m., except in Omaha, which is 5:30 p.m. to 7:00 p.m.)
Aug. 19, Columbus, library, 2500 14th St., in English and Spanish 
Sept. 5, Lincoln, First Presbyterian Church, 840 S. 17th St.
Sept. 9, North Platte, library, 120 W. 4th St.
Sept. 16, Grand Island, library, 1124 W 2nd St.
Sept. 22, Omaha, Willa Cather library, 1905 S. 44th St.



She referred to a trip she recently made to Salt Lake City, where she once lived. She said a light rail system allowed her to ride from the airport to downtown and her hotel for $1.25.
“It reinforced in my mind how far behind Nebraska is in mass transportation,” said Juarez. “That kind of reliability and affordability should be available to everyone in Nebraska.”
According to the Juarez-led legislative resolution seeking the study, interest in rail transit and public transportation has grown in Nebraska, especially among young professionals. In addition to trying to retain homegrown talent and meeting workforce needs, the resolution said passenger rail projects can drive tourism and large public and private investment.
The study, among other tasks, will examine plans that the Amtrak passenger railroad may have relevant to Nebraska. Juarez said the study and recommendations from the public town halls will help inform legislation she plans to present in January. 
Costs to buy and own a vehicle are fast increasing, Juarez noted. “These transportation systems need to be in place, because there are people who can’t even afford to buy a car,” she said.
A major roadblock to expanding passenger rail service, she acknowledged, is cost. Juarez said she recognizes that “plenty of research” still is ahead.
A less expensive pathway, Juarez said, would be to use existing rails, perhaps adding more frequent intercity Amtrak trips between, say, Omaha and Lincoln.
 California Zephyr

Currently, she said, Nebraska’s passenger rail service is limited to Amtrak’s California Zephyr route that stops in Omaha, Lincoln, Hastings, Holdrege and McCook on its way from Chicago to Emeryville, California. Nebraska stops are typically in the late night or early morning hours, not geared toward workers or a daily outing.

“It’s what we call a long-distance train that runs daily, although the time-keeping in the wintertime can be challenging,” said Clyde Anderson, a representative of ProRail Nebraska. 
Snow and the fact the Zephyr shares tracks with freight trains can throw off schedules. Anderson said pickup and drop off times aren’t convenient for commuters wanting to move from one Nebraska town to another.
“There’s a lot of people who ride between intermediate points,” he said, not necessarily from one end of the route to the other end.
Juarez has held information-gathering discussions with sources including representatives of a local railroad. One suggestion Juarez said she received during preliminary discussions was to start with test excursion trips headed to a Nebraska football or volleyball game, for example.
The Nebraska Department of Transportation said in a statement to the Nebraska Examiner that passenger rail currently is “not viable in the state because the development of such a route would pose a significant cost, and there is currently no mechanism to pay for such a project with existing state revenue.”
The state has been involved with groups dedicated to expansion and study of passenger rail, including the Midwest Interstate Passenger Rail Commission (MIPRC), which Nebraska helped establish. However, lawmakers withdrew from the multi-state commission under a 2015 proposal by then-State Sen. Bill Kintner of Papillion, who said in his bill’s intent statement that membership benefits “do not outweigh the expenditure of tax dollars on dues.”
The commission in conjunction with the Federal Railroad Administration released a draft  four years ago for a 40-year regional plan, identifying key corridors. The plan at that time did not extend beyond Omaha, the NDOT statement said, adding that no route into Nebraska is officially planned.

At least two state senators in recent years have launched efforts to rejoin the commission that coordinates and supports improvements to passenger rail service among its members. The most recent proposal was earlier this year by Sen. Dan Quick of Grand Island. Sen. George Dungan of Lincoln made a push in 2023, saying also that it was important for Nebraska to have a voice in future passenger development and funding allocation.
“Whether the Nebraska Legislature should choose to reenter the MIPRC, as has been proposed in past years legislation, or commit to any other opportunities to study passenger rail, NDOT will remain committed to delivering a high-quality, safe and efficient transportation system for the movement of people and goods in Nebraska,” the statement said.
 Workforce, tourism

The ProRail group, which is associated with the Rail Passenger Association, wants the state DOT to update a state rail passenger plan, Anderson said.
He said his group has advocated in the past for a second Amtrak train that would run during daytime hours across Nebraska. ProRail also supports improved bus service between Nebraska cities, including Omaha and Lincoln.
A company that had provided daily bus rides to students between the Omaha and Lincoln campuses of the University of Nebraska at one time was interested in offering the service to a broader audience, Anderson said. He said the idea fizzled during the COVID-19 pandemic and to his knowledge has not been revived.
Lack of convenient public transit options between Omaha and Lincoln, he said, can hinder people such as himself from, for example, testifying on a bill before the Legislature. 
Juarez said better intercity transit opportunities also could help fill labor gaps and encourage more tourism and entertainment outings between cities. “The potential is massive,” she said.
Organizers of the town halls said they hope to hear voices from urban and rural communities. Virtual participation is an option. Those who want a remote connection are asked to email mjuarez@leg.ne.gov at least two days in advance of the chosen meeting to get a registration link.
An online survey also is ongoing and hosted by Poll The Vote, which plans to provide results to the Nebraska Legislature and the LR 203 interim study.

(Photo: Cassandra Stephenson)Ford Motor Company will delay mass production of its next-generation electric pickup truck at its West Tennessee plant until 2028, the company confirmed Thursday.
Ford informed its suppliers of the delay — a result of the company shifting its focus to smaller, more affordable models — in June. The company also pushed back production of its electric transit van at its plant in Ohio from 2026 to 2028.
Prototypes of the truck will still begin production at BlueOval City in Stanton, Tennessee in 2027.
“F-150 Lightning, America’s best-selling electric truck, and E-Transit continue to meet today’s customer needs,” a company spokesperson stated. “We remain focused on delivering our Ford+ plan and will be nimble in adjusting our product launch timing to meet market needs and customer demand while targeting improved profitability.”
This announcement comes roughly a year after Ford first delayed production of the truck from its initial production goal of 2025 to 2027. At the time, Ford said the decision was part of a shift toward prioritizing hybrid vehicles and producing lower-cost batteries to improve profitability.
Ford announced its $5.6 billion investment in the BlueOval City campus in Haywood County in 2021, pledging to create 5,800 jobs in return for a nearly $1 billion incentive from the state. The Tennessee Electric Vehicle Center where the electric pickup truck will be manufactured plans to employ roughly 3,000 of those workers.
The company has teased a “Model T moment” announcement about its plans to “design and assemble breakthrough electric vehicles in America” at an appearance in Kentucky slated for Aug. 11 at 9:20 a.m. CT.

The state school board in July approved the first NIL policy for student athletes, and the policy went into effect Friday.
Since the NCAA allowed college athletes to profit from their NIL in 2021, the ripple effects of this change have now affected high school and middle school sports. More than 40 states have laws and state high school association rules governing NIL for young athletes.
North Carolina’s first high school NIL year included a $1.2 million deal for a high school quarterback, Sports Illustrated reported.

Wayne Ryan, executive director of the West Virginia Secondary School Activities Commission, said the state’s new policy sets general guidelines that will protect students from violating their eligibility under amateur athlete rules. 
“It’s basically going to have to be evaluated on a case by case basis,” he said, adding that they pulled from other states’ polices to create a starting point for student athlete NIL in West Virginia. 
“We’re just trying to serve the student athlete appropriately and keep our competitive rules and policy in place,” Ryan added.
The policy put forth by the WVSAAC outlines how students can use their NIL for monetary gain. It bans school employees, including coaches, from being involved in a student athlete’s use of their NIL.
Students are prohibited from making any reference to their school or wearing their school’s logo when engaging in any NIL activity. For example, they couldn’t wear their high school football or cheerleading uniform while participating in a local television commercial. Students also can’t reference the WVSAAC.
“They have to keep it independent of their school and athletic life,’ Ryan said. “Honestly, they have received notoriety for that, but they can’t use that as part of their advertisement.” 
Student athletes also can’t engage in NIL activities to advertise for a number of products, including alcohol, cannabis, weapons, prescription drugs and more. 
  Paul Saluja
Paul Saluja, an attorney in Charleston, visited the state Capitol earlier this year with a successful student athlete and met with state lawmakers about the importance of an NIL policy. He said families don’t want multimillion dollar endorsements; they’re looking for flexibility. He argues that it gives student athletes a reason to stay in West Virginia. 
“Some of these student athletes, they will do well in high school, they’ll do well at the collegiate level, but they’re not going to make it at the pro level,” Saluja said. “This at least allows them the opportunity to go ahead and at least, if not secure their future, but get a good head start on securing their future.”
Ryan said as NIL policies have become standard for states, he had received numerous inquiries from parents outside of West Virginia whose children had NIL deals and were considering relocating to the state. 
Ryan said the policy will continue to be under evaluation “because NIL is an ever fluid ongoing situation.”
He encouraged students and parents considering NIL deals to contact the WVSAAC’s director of compliance to ensure there would be no issues with eligibility.

More […]","Arkansas State Auditor Dennis Milligan looks at his computer in his office at the state capitol on July 30, 2025. (Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)Ever wished you could open up your mailbox and find $100?
That wish could come true for some Arkansans under a new state unclaimed property law. Act 114 of 2025, which went into effect earlier last week, allows the Arkansas State Auditor to automatically return thousands of dollars of unclaimed money to their owners.
More specifically, the law allows the auditor to mail property valued at less than $5,000 to owners if they live within the state of Arkansas and the auditor “reasonably believes” it belongs to them, even if they haven’t filed a claim for it.
That means unclaimed property could find its way into the inboxes of thousands of Arkansans without requiring them to go through a claims process, State Auditor Dennis Milligan told the Advocate.
“The next two or three months is going to be a lot of fun for Arkansans, because the checks will start going out,” Milligan said. One in four Arkansans have money sitting in the unclaimed property program, he said.
In addition to its other roles, the auditor’s office is responsible for around $400 million in unclaimed property from around the state, which is held in “perpetuity” until it’s claimed, Milligan said.
With the new law, Milligan said his office anticipates sending out nearly a fourth of that — $83 million — to approximately 360,000 people. Milligan said the average payout is expected to be a little over $100.
“This program is very, very important to me,” Milligan said. “You know, $200 might not mean anything to one person, but it may mean the difference between being able to pay a utility bill or … put[ting] some food on the table.”
Milligan’s office receives money from a variety of sources, including abandoned checking accounts, rebates and insurance adjustments.
“I got 20 bucks here a while back off of some kind of rebate,” Milligan said. “A former employer tried to send you your last check, and they couldn’t find you, so they forwarded it to us. It’s a multitude of different reasons why we get sent this money.”
Unclaimed property is more than money. The office keeps a book with pictures of some of the more interesting physical property in its care  — a World War II-era telegram referencing a conversation with Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, a $10,000 bill, signed Nolan Ryan baseball cards  — obtained from abandoned safety deposit boxes or an inheritance that went unclaimed. That property is meticulously catalogued and stored.
Getting Arkansans to come and collect what they’re owed, however, can be a difficult task, Milligan said, because many people don’t know they’re owed money at all. Fears about being scammed have also come up.
In some cases, property can go unclaimed for decades. Most people don’t know that the unclaimed property program exists, Milligan said, something that still “amazes” him.
Even Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders has unclaimed property, according to the auditor’s office’s online database, where Arkansans can go to see if they are owed money.

Milligan and his staff criss-cross the state to raise awareness for unclaimed property — and to get people to see if they have any in their name. Milligan has personally driven to the homes of people who were owed large sums to convince them to fill out the claims form.
Even for those who weren’t suspicious or knew they were owed money, the paperwork sometimes stood in the way of returning their property, Milligan said. Prior to Act 114, if someone wanted to reclaim property from the auditor’s office, regardless of the value, they had to fill out a form and verify their identity before being sent their property.
Republican Sen. Dave Wallace of Leachville, who introduced the act, said Milligan came to him with the idea for the legislation last year. Automatically repatriating the funds in the possession of the state to their rightful owners, Wallace said, was just good government.
Wallace said he was a “good example” of the benefits of the law  because “the state has $238 that belongs to either me, or my wife, Karen, from some event a couple years ago. I didn’t even know about it. And there’s going to be thousands and tens of thousands of Arkansans in that same situation.”
Milligan said his office will use software to validate the identities and addresses of unclaimed property owners before mailing a check. Getting through the backlog will take time, he said, but eligible unclaimed property owners will begin receiving letters informing them that a check is on the way in the coming months. The check will follow a few weeks after as long as the original letter isn’t returned as undeliverable.
“I mean, who can argue about Arkansans getting their money back?” Milligan said. “I haven’t had anybody complain yet.”
Even with the law, Milligan said he still encourages Arkansans to check the unclaimed property database occasionally. The new law only allows the auditor’s office to send money, and only if it’s $5,000 or less. Any more than that, and the person owed the money still has to fill out the paperwork that was previously required.
Physical property isn’t eligible for automatic repatriation either, nor is property that multiple people or businesses have claims to. For example, if someone is owed money as part of an inheritance that has multiple claimants, they still have to fill out the auditor’s form online.

,Mississippi Today,2025-08-11 10:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,"Mississippi college students  bet on sports online despite state ban, Ole Miss study shows",Michael Goldberg,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/08/11/mississippi-college-students-sports-betting-online-study/,"A potentially large number of students are finding ways to place bets on legitimate platforms, not just illicit betting sites, even though mobile sports betting remains illegal in Mississippi.","As Mississippi lawmakers are set to again consider legalizing mobile sports betting, the University of Mississippi has completed a new study offering a snapshot of the gambling habits of college students across the state. 
The survey — for which results were shared with Mississippi Today before publication — of nearly 1,600 Mississippi college students shows that almost 60% of students who reported gambling in the last year said they placed online bets on “legal” sportsbooks. 
This indicates that a potentially large number of students are finding ways to place bets on legitimate platforms, not just illicit betting sites, even though mobile sports betting remains illegal in Mississippi, according to one of the study’s coauthors.    
“Our students are showing similar patterns to those identified by the NCAA and seen nationally, including that legality doesn’t make a difference with college students,” said Dan Durkin, an associate professor of social work.
The survey did not ask about the use of illicit betting platforms because most students either don’t know or don’t care whether or not the practice is illegal, Durkin said. The researchers plan to create a variable before publication that reflects illegality, he added.  
College campuses have become hubs of activity for sports betting and, increasingly, gambling addiction. This has prompted calls for research into mobile sports betting’s growth and impact on young adults. 
As more states began to legalize online betting and concern over addition grew, the NCAA  surveyed students and found that many young adults were wagering on sports despite age, geographic and legal restrictions on betting. 
Mobile sports betting statewide has remained illegal in Mississippi, largely due to fears that legalization could harm the bottom line of the state’s casinos and increase gambling addiction. In 2024, illegal online betting in Mississippi made up about 5% of the national illegal market, which is about $3 billion in illegal bets in Mississippi, proponents said that year. 
The new University of Mississippi study, conducted by Durkin, Hannah Allen, Nicholas McAfee, George McClellan and Ronald Rychlak in conjunction with the University of Mississippi’s William Magee Institute for Student Wellbeing, also found that 32% of students reported using family members or friends to place bets over the past year. About 18% reported placing bets in person at casinos, 15% bet online through a sportsbook outside the U.S. or Canada and another 15% place bets with illegal bookies. 
Mississippi residents have placed, according to some analysts, billions of dollars in online sports bets through illicit offshore betting platforms. But the new survey results show that young people in Mississippi have found a way to place online bets on legitimate platforms as well. They might be doing this by using tools such as virtual private networks, or VPNs, to access betting sites.

Some students told Durkin that their peers learned how to use VPNs after Mississippi enacted a law in 2023 requiring age verification for pornographic sites, prompting some pornography companies to block access to their sites in the state. 
There are just under 80,000 students enrolled at Mississippi’s eight public universities and the University of Mississippi Medical Center. That translates to somewhere between 4,700 and 6,400 Mississippi students facing serious gambling issues currently, Durkin said, using a range of state and national estimates on gambling-related “harm.” This can include psychological distress, debt, and dips in academic performance. 
Of those, 20%–30% may eventually develop a gambling disorder, though gambling disorders can often take time to develop, Durkin said. Those are his estimates, not figures included in the survey.
In the survey, a majority of students who bet on sports had no or a low risk for “problem gambling,” but 10% had a moderate risk for problem gambling, and 6% met criteria for problem gambling.       
The survey looked at gambling across the board. About 39% of students gambled in the past year, with lottery (18%), card games (17%), and sports betting (16%) as the most prevalent types of gambling. Gambling was more prevalent among students who were male, white, lived off campus, participated in athletics, were involved in Greek life and had higher GPAs, the survey found.

Zooming in on sports betting, the most prevalent way to bet was online through a sportsbook. 
The most common sports to bet on were the NFL football (62%), college football (53%), college men’s basketball (48%), and NBA basketball (46%). Typical monthly spending ranged from $0-$6,000, with an average of about $100 per month. 
Favorable regulatory and technological shifts have led to rapid growth for the U.S. online gambling market in recent years. But the industry continues to be undercut by illegal operators. Online gross gaming revenue in the U.S. topped $90 billion in 2024, $67 billion of which went to unlicensed players, according to research commissioned by the Campaign for Fairer Gambling, a group that lobbies against illegal gambling.
Changing state regulations have kicked off a lobbying blitz in states such as Mississippi. 
The Mississippi House in 2023, 2024 and 2025 passed legislation legalizing online betting, but it has died in the Senate.
Some form of sports betting is legal in 40 states, though only 20 have full online betting with multiple operators, according to Action Network, a sports betting application and news site. Some states have only in-person betting, and some only have a single online operator. Mississippi permits sports betting, but it only allows bets made in person at casinos or bets made with apps on mobile devices while inside casinos. 
Mississippi House Speaker Jason White, a Republican, has been one of the state’s most vocal proponents of mobile sports betting. He has indicated that his caucus will again push to legalize online betting during the 2026 legislative session.
Durkin said if Mississippi does legalize online betting, the legislation should include funding for addiction treatment paid for with a tax on gambling companies. Several states, such as Virginia, Kentucky and Tennessee, allocate tax revenues collected through gambling to addiction resources.  
“They should consider modelling our state after what other states have done and include in their legislation money to attend to these problems,” Durkin said. “They need to tax the people who are causing the problems to fund fixing them.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/08065906/Online-Gaming-2.jpg,,,2025-08-11 06:58:12.367055

(John Gray/Verite News)In late July, officials with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement provided access to three detention centers they operate in Louisiana to a group of about 20 civil rights advocates. 
Their tour included the Central Louisiana ICE Processing Center, located on the former England Air Force Base in Alexandria. It’s become a conduit for individuals apprehended around the country to the nine ICE detention centers in Louisiana, where immigration court watchers say judges are more likely to be aligned to the Trump administration’s enforcement policy.
The other ICE facilities on the tour were the South Louisiana Processing Center in Basile, which holds only women, and the Pine Prairie Processing Center in Evangeline Parish.
The Illuminator conducted two separate interviews with attorneys who went on the tour, and excerpts from these transcripts are shared below. They have been edited for length and clarity. 
One interview featured Kerry Kennedy and Anthony Enriquez with the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights organization, who are in Episode 17 of “The Light Switch,” our weekly podcast.

﻿ 
The other interview is with Alanah Odoms, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana, and Nora Ahmed, the organization’s legal director. 
RFK Human Rights and the ACLU of Louisiana have collaborated in the past, most notably as of late on a 2024 report – “Inside the Black Hole” – that detailed “abused and disappeared” immigrants in the state. It was compiled based on interviews with more than 6,000 interviews and seven tours with officials from the New Orleans ICE office. 
Last month’s tour was just the latest trip to the state’s ICE facilities for Ahmed and Enriquez, both of whom have clients in custody. 
The interviews included claims of unsanitary living conditions, inadequate medical care and abuse. Questions about these allegations were sent to the ICE media relations office, and its representatives have yet to respond.

Q: You’ve visited these facilities before. Did you get the sense that preparations were made in advance to have each facility put its best foot forward, or was it much as you’ve seen on past visits?
Odoms: This was actually my first time inside immigrant detention.  … I was really surprised that it did not seem like much preparation went into making things appear, at least visually, better than what they normally are. I think where the real dog and pony show took place was in their presentation to us about their operations and their standards and their protocols. That was like night and day, hearing from ICE about how they care for people and what their standards are, versus hearing directly from the residents.
Q: The first stop on the tour was the ICE Processing Center in Alexandria. Take us through your first impressions.
Odoms: First of all, every single one of these places has many layers of barbed wire around it, so they depict prison immediately. Then you’re brought through metal detectors and security. You’re you have to surrender everything, even a smart watch. You’re not allowed to have any recording devices, anything like that. Then you’re brought through these metal sally port doors, which are these huge metal doors that slam shut behind you, and you are very, very aware that you are in a prison. 
Then you walk in and you see there are two main areas in the staging facility where people are either held in prison, like cells, like a cell block, very traditional prison … and it opens up into  what they call airport-style seating area, where people are actually sitting, chained at their hands, chained at their feet, and chained at their bellies, waiting for their planes to take off. 
That is what you see as soon as you walk in, and they did not try to hide the people who were waiting. There were about maybe a handful, if not maybe 10 to 12 people who were waiting for a flight, who were sitting clearly chained … at every single appendage of their body. 
The second room is more of a gymnasium style room where there are between 70 to 90 people being housed in bunk beds. … This aging facility is where the male population is held inside these either cell blocks or bunk-style barracks. 
In the open room, there’s a large Plexiglas or glass partition where you can very clearly see who’s inside, and they can very clearly see you. As soon as folks saw us, they immediately came to that window. And honestly, the looks on all of their faces were like, “Help.”

Q: Kerry, your organization has a global focus on human rights concerns. What’s happening in Louisiana’s ICE facilities that has made this situation one of your priorities?
  Kerry Kennedy, president of the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights organization. (RFK Human Rights photo)
Kennedy: When we were in Louisiana, in the detention centers, we met with a woman who is also one of our clients, who her doctor told her that she might have colon cancer, and she was picked up [to see a doctor] a couple of days later. She’s been asking for four and a half months to see a doctor to see whether or not she has colon cancer, and her ability to see that doctor has been denied for four and a half months. 
We met another woman, an elderly woman, who begged and pleaded to see a doctor because she came into the facility walking perfectly, and now she’s forced to use a wheelchair, and she doesn’t know why. She’s begged and pleaded to see a doctor. They finally said, ”We’ll send you to health care,” and she was sexually assaulted when she did that. 
I met another young woman who’s 26 years old. She is gay. She’s from Russia. She fled Russia because of the oppression against gay people, because her life was in danger. She’s got a master’s in chemical engineering, and she was working for a pharmaceutical company, making medicines for us, for our country, and now instead, she’s in this detention center. 
This makes no sense. These are people who are in our communities, who are creating change, who are paying taxes, who are making our country stronger and better. And instead, now you and I … [are] paying through our tax dollars for their breakfast, lunch and dinner every single day, and for them to be in a prison situation instead about the world creating change. So that’s why we’re attacking this.
Q: How do you mount a legal strategy for your clients against an administration that is willing to subvert due process when it comes to immigration law?
Enriquez: This is a question that actually has two answers. One is we work hand in hand with people who are living and working in the communities where detention centers exist. So for those of you who are in Louisiana, one thing that’s been interesting is when we have discussions with the workers who are guards in some of these private prisons, these detention centers. They tell us, “I really didn’t have another choice. It was either work here or in a casino, and this was the only thing around for me. This was a way that I could feed my own family.” 
So a core element of what we’re doing is to try and extend the notion of human rights, not just to the people who are suffering the types of physical sexual abuse that that you just heard Kerry speak of the detained immigrants, but actually the workers who are being exploited in these detention centers as well by private prison.
CEOs … are pocketing these taxpayer dollars for their own bonuses. People might not be aware that the head of the corporate leadership of the GEO Group, which is one of the owners of many of the detention centers in Louisiana, they just gave themselves big fat raises after the passage of this last domestic policy bill. That’s money that they’re actually taking out of the hands of pockets of Louisiana workers as well. So that’s one of the ways that we really try and broaden the conception of what human rights is, and we let people know this is a big fight that’s affecting all of us. 
Q: Statistics show that roughly half of the people being detained in Louisiana ICE facilities do not have a prior criminal background, and many have not been formally charged with a crime.
Odoms: The only designation that they have that separates people who they believe have criminal histories is this high- [or] low-designation, and whether you get put in a cell block or whether you get put in the barrack style living conditions. 
When we asked about classification for how people were classified as either high or low, we didn’t get a very clear answer on that at all. Sometimes they were saying, “Well, they come to us that way from other facilities, so someone else is making the classification, and we’re just kind of rubber stamping that and either putting somebody in a cell block or putting someone in a barracks.” Or, “We have a point system,” and they said, “Oh, you’re going to have to request that in writing.” 
So anytime we kind of brushed up against a question that would really illuminate what was happening in terms of constitutional violations and real problems, all of those questions were met with: “That would have to be something that you submit in writing.”
Q: What explanations have you been given as to why your clients are being warehoused indefinitely in ICE detention without any opportunity for bond, and what level of proof is the federal government providing to justify this?
Ahmed: We have two clients [and] we’ll be filing habeas petitions* in short order that illustrate this. 
One of our clients, they’ve attempted to remove her to six different countries. All have said no, but she’s still there because apparently they’re just going to run through the list, which is … wildly preposterous. 

* What is a habeas petition? It’s a legal filing with the court to require authorities to present the legal reason someone is held in prison.

In terms of bond, we’re going to bring another habeas challenge. Because right now you’ve probably heard the administration is [taking into custody] people who appear at their immigration proceedings. We have a client who appeared for her asylum proceeding, and then she was whisked away. The reason she was whisked away is because of a newfound interpretation of the United States Code, Section 1225, which no longer is interpreting mandatory detention as applicable to people appearing at the border, and is now just applying to anybody who entered the country without inspection. 
So you’re now starting to see people like our client, who’ve been in the United States for two decades, showing up as they’re supposed to to an immigration court hearing. Are you really a flight risk if you’re showing up to your court hearing? Probably not. And in her particular case, there’s no criminal record. So you’re also talking about somebody who there is no conceivable way that you could possibly say that she’s a danger. 
I still want to say that people who do have criminal records are also not dangerous, let’s be clear, because in this country, a criminal record could include not paying a fine or having to pick up your child and not making a court date. So I don’t like to pitch people with criminal records as people who are dangerous because the vast majority are not.

Q: Recently in Louisiana, two powerful members of our congressional delegation intervened to secure the release of two detainees. House Majority Leader Steve Scalise stepped in to have an Iranian woman who’s lived in New Orleans for nearly 50 years released, and Sen. John Kennedy was instrumental in the release of a Mexican woman who’s married to a U.S. Marine. Does this give you any glimmer of hope that other powerful Republicans will call for the Trump administration to pause its sweeping immigration enforcement efforts?
Kennedy: I think it’s important that people at the highest levels are beginning to understand the impact of these terrible laws. You know, one of the problems with GEO Group is that it runs prisons. So this is a detention facility that is run as a prison. 
But before this, we were not always putting people in detention, and a lot of these people have been in the communities, have been in the Marines, have served our country. They are our teachers. They are giving us the food that we eat every day. They’re making our medicines.
They can be in the community, and they’re great programs – proven again and again and again – where 100% of the people who are released into the community return for their detention here, for their immigration hearings and also to be deported, if that’s ultimately what’s supposed to happen to them. 
So why in the world are we taking people? Why are we kidnapping people off the street and treating them with such inhumanity and harming our country at the same time? This makes no sense, unless you think about it as a way to enrich a cruel corporation, which is what’s happened. 
Q: The sheer number of people being detained makes it close to impossible that everyone is represented by an attorney. Is there any solution within sight that, at the very least, would ensure every detainee receives legal representation?
Kennedy: Yeah, well, there’s a clear solution – open up the doors and let people be in the community, which was the solution under the Bush administration, the Obama administration, many of the other administrations. That’s what would happen to people, and there are proven programs where 100% of them come back to their [immigration court] hearing. So that’s the least expensive, most effective and best way to assure that people’s rights are not being compromised by the United States government.   
Q: We’re seeing increasing incidents of people showing up for immigration court hearings at the appointed time and date, following official instructions only to be taken into ICE custody and placed into detention. How are you advising clients who might want to adhere to the rules but face a good chance they will be apprehended and then fast-tracked toward deportation or imprisoned indefinitely?     
Odoms:  We have very direct guidance for people who are able to obtain counsel. They absolutely need to do so, and they need to presume that they are going to be apprehended. Like, it’s not if they’re going to be taken. It’s when they’re going to be taken. 
But here’s the thing, I really want this to come across: Everyone is still having faith in this system, that if they actually present themselves and continue to do what’s right, being compliant, being adherent, that they will actually be given some kind of consideration. And that is not true
Ahmed: … What preparations people need to do? They need to prepare in two to three very distinct ways, I think, and we can tell them, talk to an immigration attorney about a motion to reopen your immigration proceedings very quickly. Also try to ensure that you have access to a federal practitioner who will be able to file a habeas petition for you when you’re incarcerated. 
… We’ve seen a lot of congressional folks start stepping up, have a privacy waiver signed and make sure that everyone important in your life, including your congressional representatives, is able to communicate on your behalf with ICE. You can download the document off of the [ICE] website. … You get to fill in the information of whoever is allowed to have access, and then they can start advocating for you with ICE. You should know your congressional representatives, who can do that, your local friends and family.
Q: Alana, your organization has always had as its bedrock the belief that our Constitution, our laws and judicial system ultimately would not let us down. Do you feel that certainty still exists?
Odoms: Yeah, it does feel like the safety net of our Constitution has started to fray in some really fundamental ways. 
… Myself and every other lawyer that’s been trained in this country, we’re trained in the Constitution, both of Louisiana and of the United States of America. We’re not trained to actually respond to an authoritarian regime – that is the true issue that we’re all facing. What do you do when the Constitution doesn’t apply anymore? What do we do when we actually have laws and those laws are being completely thrown out, how do we respond? 
There’s a lot for us to learn from organizers and folks who have been doing work outside of the power structure, because I don’t think we’re going to find our answers in the traditional way that we have in the past.
…  That’s the outside strategy that we have to work on. It doesn’t necessarily have to do with filing a lawsuit, but it does have to do with strategizing around people power. How do we do that? Because these systems are only going to buckle under the the pressure of people saying, “Oh, hell no, that looks like an authoritarian regime. That’s not what we want. We want a process. We want due process. We want people to have access to lawyers. We want people to have access to all the things that our constitution says.” 
That’s a people power movement.

At some point, most will be released.
The question for crime victims, people behind bars and the families of both is when.
How that question gets answered is at the heart of a working group created by Gov. Mike Kehoe earlier this year to examine Missouri’s parole system to bring “clarity, transparency and accountability” to the process. 
The deadline for the 15-member panel to complete its work is Oct. 1.
At the panel’s one and only public hearing June 13, Tony Helfrecht, the chairman of the Missouri Board of Probation and Parole, called the panel a “once-in-a-decade opportunity” that would overhaul supervision for paroled people with increased accountability “with the goal of safeguarding public safety while promoting successful reintegration, reintroduction and reducing recidivism.” 
Missouri math: How a 23-year sentence adds up to more than 40 years in prison

Helfrecht, who is leading the working group, and department Director Trevor Foley, who is vice-chair, declined a request for interviews until the report is complete. Six other members are corrections department employees or members of the state parole board, and five represent the judiciary and law enforcement. 
Only two members were previously incarcerated. 
Prisoner advocates worry the working group is stacked with Department of Corrections employees and law enforcement, and that will result in stricter rules and delayed releases.
“I have some serious concerns that the intent of the governor’s order is not going to be met and that this is going to be lip service when it’s such a wonderful opportunity to bring clarity to a process that provides release to so many people in Missouri,” said Amy Malinowski, co-director of the Missouri office of the MacArthur Justice Center, a non-profit that advocates on behalf of people involved in the criminal justice system. 
One area advocates hope the group addresses is the parole board’s reinterpretation of the minimum time that must be served for some offenses. While state statute sets some minimums, such as for repeat offenders or particularly heinous crimes, the board has wide latitude in state law to set percentages of time for particular levels of crime, or to change them by rule or policy decisions.
The Division of Probation and Parole is part of the state corrections department but independent in many ways. It was sued in 2019 for the new way it has applied a policy — in place since 1985 — that incarcerated people must serve at least 15 years on any life sentence that is eligible for parole.
The change that prompted the ultimately unsuccessful court challenges pushed the parole dates for hundreds of incarcerated Missourians years — in some cases a decade — into the future. 
Kent Gipson, a Kansas City attorney who represents several incarcerated people in appeals, said the change was unnecessary.
“If a guy’s shown he’s a worthy candidate for parole and he’s done 28 years, and he’s 50, or however old he probably is, what’s the point in keeping him another 15 years?” said Kent Gipson, Dunn’s attorney. “It’s stupid.”
The 2019 change was a topic of discussion at the working group’s brief June 13 public hearing, where only three people testified during the 25 minutes  meeting. In addition to the questions about how eligibility is calculated, issues identified in testimony are:

Boilerplate language on forms delivering parole board decisions that give no details on the reasons for denials.
Lengthy delays between parole being granted at a hearing and the actual release. Current rules allow the hearings to be held four months prior to potential release, but until recently, those hearings were up to two years in advance of release.
Unwillingness of the parole board to use its discretion to convert consecutive sentences to concurrent sentences in eligible cases.

“When we give people a chance to reunite with their families and communities in a timely manner, we reinforce public safety,” Clifton Davis of the Missouri Justice Coalition told the working group. “We do not weaken it.”
There will be no more public hearings because the working group is under a tight deadline, Pojmann said. Instead, she said, written comments are being accepted.
 Boilerplate language

When a person in a Missouri prison has a parole hearing, the board’s decision is delivered on a one-page form.
There are eight lines where an X indicates the decision, whether it is to deny and reschedule, set a release date or other action. At the bottom, there are 12 lines where reasons for the decision are given.
Many times, when parole is denied, the only reason provided is that “release at this time would depreciate the seriousness of the present offense…” 
The parole board should give more details, especially to tell the incarcerated person what they should do to mitigate the concerns listed, said Courtney Everett, coordinator of the St. Louis University Prison Education Program.
 This form, given to incarcerated people in the Missouri Department of Corrections after a parole hearing (screenshot).
Everett, along with Stacey Lannert, founder of Healing Sisters, is one of the two working group members who have served time in a Missouri prison. He was sentenced to 22 years for assault in 2004 and was released in 2021. 
When time came for his parole hearing, he said it seemed formulaic. He was approaching his conditional release date, when he had to be released barring a reason to deny it.
“They really didn’t ask me questions,” he said. “It was like, ‘Where are you going, who are you going to live with?’ It was like 10 minutes. I didn’t say anything. But at the same time, these are the people who control whether a person is being released from prison. And sometimes you don’t know what they’re thinking.”
When denying parole, Malinowski said, the board should be required to give concrete, detailed reasons.
“The board should be required to explain the basis for their decision, cite the evidence they relied upon, and then explain what that person can do to better prepare themselves for release,” she said. “It’s not individualized other than the offender’s name and number changing on the form.”
The working group should mandate the change, Davis told them at the hearing.
“When individuals meet all conditions and have clear plans for success, they deserve more than a form letter,” he said. “They deserve a response that recognizes who they are.”
 Parole particulars

How much time any person eligible for parole spends behind bars is determined in part by the classification of their offense in statute, as well their history of felony sentences. The harshest punishment, and the only one where no release is possible, is for first-degree murder.
Determining an individual’s earliest parole date is a calculation based partly in statute and partly in regulation. Basic eligibility is determined by the rules.
The minimum wait for parole eligibility is 15% of a sentence for the lowest-level felonies. 
The percentage escalates as the classification of felony goes up the scale. For any felony that is a sexual or violent offense, or involves abuse of a child, regardless of classification, regulations require 33% of the sentence be served before parole eligibility.
Statutes set minimum time before parole eligibility for anyone previously placed in the custody of the department. That can be up to 80% of their sentence, depending on the number of previous terms in prison. 
There are 25 offenses where the person sentenced to prison must serve 85% of their time before what is called conditional release. All prisoners have a conditional release period of up to five years at the end of their sentence where they are supervised until their term is completed.

The parole board does have some discretion, though advocates say it rarely exercises that discretion. It’s a scenario the working group was urged to address in its report to the governor. 
One area in particular that was highlighted to the working group is the board’s ability to convert consecutive life without parole sentences for crimes committed by juveniles into concurrent sentences.
Missouri law allows the parole board to consider paroling people who committed offenses with long terms as juveniles when they have served 15 years. But the board rarely uses its discretion,  Davis said.
“This isn’t about giving people a free pass,” he said. “It’s about recognizing that the law has already provided a mechanism to evaluate whether continuing consecutive time still serves the purpose of justice.”
The board also rarely uses its power to grant medical paroles for people near the end of their lives.
The MacArthur Justice Center sued the department to secure the release of Walter Hunter, who was serving multiple life sentences and was dying of liver cancer. The effort was unsuccessful and he died in 2017 at the South Central Correctional Center in Licking.
“I remember visiting with him, and he was in a wheelchair and was jaundiced and very swollen belly,” Malinowski said in an interview with The Independent. “And I got to know his sister very well, and all that he wanted was to be able to die with her.”
 Transparency

The working group is limited in what it can do because its directive is to examine the regulations governing the parole process, Pojmann said, not sentencing statutes or any other law.
But there are steps that could increase transparency and assure the public that each case is being considered on its merits, Malinowski said.
“They’re just too closed to provide any sort of comfort to the public that they’re doing their job well, making reasonable and evidence-based decisions and giving people a fair shot,” Malinowski said.
Some states televise their parole hearings, Everett said. That helps maintain a serious attitude and brings clarity to the individual issues the board must consider.
Perhaps the biggest obstacle to a more transparent system is the anonymity the current process gives to decision-makers, he said.
“A lot of times, they’re looking for reasons to keep people incarcerated, to protect their own interest, their own conscience, or, sometimes, to protect their own careers.” Everett said. “Because if you’re the public official that lets somebody out of prison, you’re less likely to get voted in.”
One goal, Boone County Circuit Judge Brouck Jacobs, a member of the working group, said in an interview with The Independent, should be more certainty for crime victims, defendants and the public when a sentence is handed down.
Only someone familiar with the rules and laws governing parole would be able to estimate how factors such as the severity of the crime, the person’s history of incarceration and the age of the offender determine a release date. It should be clear to everyone in the courtroom what a sentence means, Jacobs said. 
“They think somebody’s got seven years for breaking into their home, a burglary,” Jacobs said, “and then I think they’re shocked and chagrined when the person’s out in a year-and-a-half.”

(KCTCS photo) About two-thirds of Kentucky community college students surveyed last year say they have experienced depression or anxiety while 1 in 5 reported engaging in “self-injurious behavior.”
In response, the Kentucky Community and Technical College System is launching a Mental Health Strategy for its roughly 100,000 students.
KCTCS President Ryan Quarles told the Lantern that since taking on his role in 2023, he’s sought to prioritize mental health.
“We know that …. half of all community college students across the country struggle with mental health issues, and the report that we see here clearly shows that Kentucky is higher than national averages,” he said. “So, we still have to learn from other states, but the need is very severe right now.” 
  Ryan Quarles (KCTCS photo)
The largest provider of postsecondary education in the state, KCTCS will educate employees and students about mental health, create a centralized document full of mental health resources for the whole system, develop a peer wellness program in which students can volunteer as mental health ambassadors for those around them, provide staff with trainings on how to spot depression and anxiety in their students and more. 
This comes in response to a 2024 Healthy Minds Study that showed that in the KCTCS system, 68% of surveyed students had depression and 66% had anxiety. That survey also showed 13% of students who took the survey were at risk of an eating disorder and 20% had already engaged in “self-injurious behavior.” 
“We know that our students are facing (a) heightened degree of mental health issues that, probably, previous generations have not faced or is undiagnosed,” Quarles said. 
Stressors facing students are numerous, he said: financial and housing concerns, food insecurity, upheaval following back-to-back floods in Eastern Kentucky, decimation by tornadoes in West and Western Kentucky and more. 
Mental health challenges already existed prior to the global pandemic that hit Kentucky in 2020, but “COVID peeled the onion peel off to show how big of an issue this is,” Quarles said. 
In 2022 the World Health Organization pointed to “unprecedented stress” during COVID-induced isolation as a key stressor driving worsening mental health. Children who switched to remote schooling also missed social milestones during that time. 
KCTCS plans to apply for grant funding to support the mental health efforts, but for now it comes out of the general budget. It’s too soon to say if the system will ask the General Assembly for project-specific funding in 2026, Quarles said. 
“I do think that our legislators are aware of the mental health issues of our students,” he said, “and I think it’s come to them both from their constituents … but also higher ed in general is talking more about this, deservedly so, across the state.”

Christopher Hetherington, executive director of strategic enrollment management at KCTCS, said more and more college students have faced mental health issues over the last two decades, and research is finally revealing the extent of the problem. 
“You’ve got the social media, you’ve got the constant, 24-hour news cycle,” he said. “You’ve got financial concerns, currently, within higher education.” 
Students also face concerns over where to get enough food — and a large percentage wouldn’t be able to easily get $500 in an emergency, Hetherington said. 
“Now that we have more resources, as far as data is concerned, we have  a more clear calling to do this work than maybe would have been 10, 15, 20 years ago,” he said. 
The Healthy Minds Study 
The Healthy Minds Study, which involved 2,500 students between Feb. 26 to March 18, 2024, presented KCTCS with a call to action: better address students’ mental health needs. 
The study showed, among other things: 

86% of respondents described their financial situation as stressful.
40% reported having moderate to severe depression with another 27% at mild. 
38% reported having moderate to severe anxiety, with another 29% at mild. 
29% of respondents felt isolated from others often, and another 36% felt that way some of the time.
72% reported that in the four weeks before being surveyed, they experienced some level of academic impairment caused by their emotional or mental difficulties. 
Among students screening positive for anxiety or depression, 27% received therapy.
23% of respondents reported that in the 12 months prior to being surveyed, they were worried about not having stable housing.
15% of respondents reported worrying about losing their steady place to live in the future and 2% reported not having a steady place to live at all.
45% of respondents were worried about not having enough food in the past year.

Quarles said this data demonstrates “a serious issue” in Kentucky. 
“I think that we always knew that mental health was an issue in America, but I think that during and post COVID, it only revealed how big of a crisis it is,” he said. “And it’s not just unique to higher ed. It’s in K-12. It’s in workplace environments. It’s in adult populations. We know that this is a national crisis right now.” 
Investments in mental health, Quarles said, should be viewed on the same level as any other type of student support. Prioritizing that, he said, will help students succeed in the long run. 
“A healthier society is going to create a healthier economy as well, meaning that students will be better prepared to finish their degree, finish their certificate and be more prepared to enter the job market and be able to fulfill the expectations that an employer may have,” he said. “And that, ultimately, increases the economic prosperity of the state as well.”
‘Nursing school is really hard:’ the pressures of being a student

Charlotte Boyd, who attended Jefferson Community and Technical College from 2019 to 2022 before transferring to Spalding University, believes such a mental health initiative would have helped her. 
Boyd, who studied nursing, suffered panic attacks, found virtual learning during the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic to be “frustrating” and didn’t feel properly supported during an intensely stressful time of her life. 
“Nursing school is really hard,” she said. “I’m not an anxious person in general, but I had to have a pretty full cardiac workup when I was at JCTC in the nursing program to make sure I wasn’t having cardiac issues. And I wasn’t. I was having … panic attacks. It was really, really horrible.” 
Boyd is now working as a labor and delivery nurse at Norton Healthcare in Louisville.  
Wendy Johnson, who attended Southcentral Kentucky Community and Technical College from 2006–2009 for respiratory therapy, faced mild stressors during her time as a student. She was the first person in her family to go to college and was often the oldest person in her classes, having started at age 31. That was “a little bit stressful,” she said. She also had two children, 11 and 7 years old. 
Johnson, who lives in Scottsville and now works across the border in Tennessee, looked at school differently than some of her peers. She was a dental assistant and originally wanted to study dental hygiene. 
“‘You’re going to give yourself a raise right here, and you’re going to have a good career,’” she told herself. Because she started school with children, studying was difficult at times. 
“I would have to stay up late or … try to do things before the kids got home from school,” she recalled. 
Still, she managed to earn a 4.0 grade point average and received an excellence award.
“At 18 years old,’ she said, “I don’t feel like I would have done as well.”

‘Get it right.’ 
KCTCS plans to do more surveys of students and monitor what works to improve mental health, Hetherington said. 
In community college, there’s also a smaller window to help than at four-year universities, he said. “Our students are gone in a year or two.” 
Each  of the system’s 16 colleges will also have freedom to customize its mental health approach since each campus population will have different needs. 
“We’re very aware that … there tends to be more reluctance in rural areas for people to talk about mental health,” Quarles said. “We also know that perhaps in the more urban areas, there may be more resources or organizations addressing mental health as well. And so there’s going to be some nuances across the state, and this is also an opportunity for us to learn from each other.” 
At the spring graduation ceremonies, KCTCS colleges awarded around 10,546 associate degrees, 1,716 diplomas and 31,062 certificates. 
“We’re the entry point for the vast majority of Kentuckians starting college, and so it’s very important for us to address mental health needs of our students, because for a lot of our students, if they don’t have a good experience with us, they may never make it to that four-year university, or may never get that skill or trade to get a job,” Quarles said. “So it’s important for us to get it right.”

Carefully assess the actions of Missouri’s governor, Republican members of the state legislature and our Congressional delegation. Then ask yourself: Whose priorities, interests and concerns have they supported, fought for and voted for?


Certainly not those of most Missourians.


Missourians voted for candidates in various elective offices to represent and fight for their interests in Jefferson City and Washington, D.C.


Instead, many of the Republican elected officials seem to have forgotten and folded to the pressure of supporting and carrying out the agenda of the Trump administration, whether it is in the best interest and well-being of Missouri citizens or not.


Look at the behavior of Missouri senators and representatives in Congress. While some bothered to proclaim that Medicaid should not be cut, at the end of the posturing they all went along with approving the Trump administration’s “Big Beautiful Bill.”


Essentially voting for the cuts in Medicaid funding that will deny tens of thousands of Missourians life-saving services. How many rural hospitals will be affected or forced to close in the coming months and years because of these cuts?


Their actions, or failures to act, are disturbing and disconcerting.


How is it that members of the Missouri congressional delegation can get away with the abdication of carrying out their governance and oversight responsibilities?


When it comes to allowing the Trump administration to usurp Congress’s power and arbitrarily disrupt, disband and defund departments that will negatively impact Missourians. First it was the department of education that was the target, cutting needed funding for school districts.


The most recent is the proposal to decentralize the department of agriculture. Will these changes hurt Missouri farmers, causing them to lose necessary funding and programmatic support? What are the positions of members of the Missouri Congressional delegation?


Our representatives in Congress have been silent and given tacit support to other actions of the Trump administration.


When it comes to the impact of increased tariffs on farmers being able to export their soybeans and other produce, and the higher cost of consumer goods across the board for families already struggling to make ends meet.


When it comes to immigration tactics that disrupt business operations, the workforce in agricultural industries and the lives of innocent family members.


When it comes to the short and long-term effects of taxation policies and the national debt, the burden of which Missourians like all Americans must bear.


When there is no oversight, no checks and balanced guardrails, how can we be confident that the policies and decisions being made will be in our best interest?


The actions of our Republican governor, Republican-controlled state legislature and other government offices are in lock-step with the Trump administration as well.


An executive order adopted and ensured the implementation of dismantling DEI programs throughout governmental departments and agencies, colleges and universities, and wherever the state had authority to issue a mandate. Businesses have been sued by the state attorney general for apparent noncompliance.


What measures are being implemented to ensure that all Missourians are treated equal and have equal access and equal opportunity? A state with a diverse population base, who is helped or hurt?


Republican state legislators in the Senate and House wrote letters urging the Missouri U.S. Senators to pass the “Big Beautiful Bill” irrespective of the negative impacts on their constituents.


The latest influence of President Trump on what goes on in Missouri is his request for the legislature to draw a new mapto eliminate one of the two Democratic congressional districts to help ensure that the Republicans maintain the majority in the House after the 2026 midterm elections.


Such a move, if successful, would eliminate the congressional district that represents Kansas City and some adjacent counties, thereby diminishing or negating the impact the representation and vote of a large number of constituents, including large minority groups.


The Republican governor and Republican-dominated legislature are seriously considering calling a special legislative session to make President Trump’s wishes happen.


Congressional districts are usually revisited or redrawn following the U.S. Census taken every 10 years that tracks population shifts and other changes. Redrawing districts mid-cycle or in an off year is solely to provide a political advantage for one party or the other.


Missouri has six Republican and two Democratic Congressional districts.


Every Missourians should think about the meaning of the political move to change that to 7 to 1.


Fundamentally, elected officials, irrespective of their party affiliations, should represent all constituents living within their electoral boundaries despite the racial and ethnic make-up or how they may have voted.


Likewise, representative government means just that. It should represent, as best as possible, all the people it governs.


As there is growing disapproval of President Trump and many of his policies by most recent polls, why are Republican state leaders continuing to bow to the pressure of jumping on an increasingly unpopular Trump agenda?


It behooves each of us to ask a critical question.


Who, among our state Republican elected officials, is standing steadfast to promote, protect and put the priorities of Missourians first amid this national political morass?",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/donaldtrumpfeb112025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-11 05:56:32.412755

(Photo courtesy of Justine Wilson)When Siri Fiske founded the Mysa Microschool in Washington, D.C., in 2016, there wasn’t a widely accepted term for her small, one-room schoolhouse model.
Now, the school is referred to on its website as one of the first microschools in the nation, and Fiske has seen a growing microschool movement since the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the five years since remote schooling amid pandemic-era lockdowns, microschools and homeschooling have emerged as increasingly popular alternatives to traditional public and private models. Smaller class sizes, individualized classrooms and lack of standardization are an appeal to parents, Fiske said.
“There’s this idea that people who open microschools are doing it for cultish or religious reasons, and there’s a misconception that all are like that,” Fiske said. “I’ve seen my students graduate into top colleges. There’s many ways to achieve academic success.”
Some education experts, however, have expressed concern about the growing movement. They question whether microschools are properly regulated and being held accountable, and whether they’ll pull dollars out of the public education system.
There is no federal definition of a microschool, and with the Trump administration’s plans to shutter the U.S. Department of Education, the onus is on states to figure them out.










Schools calling themselves microschools today are not what I would’ve called one back then. But I think that’s OK. It’s evolving.


– Siri Fiske, founder and head of Mysa School


In some states, microschools face a bind: If they operate as private schools, they’re required to meet facility, staffing and curricular standards that are often cost-prohibitive for schools their size. If they operate under homeschool laws, they face oversight, assessment mandates and reporting requirements that aren’t designed for multifamily or educator-led models.
Some states, including Georgia, Tennessee and Texas, have passed “Learning Rights Protection Acts” to codify microschools’ right to operate.
In Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts and Oregon, learning pods and microschools often face child care or private school licensing requirements if they involve multiple families, hire instructors or provide compensation for child care.
“Schools calling themselves microschools today are not what I would’ve called one back then. But I think that’s OK. It’s evolving,” Fiske said.
She pointed to the national school choice movement — and states such as West Virginia — for helping the microschool movement flourish.
In 2022, West Virginia became one of the few states to define a microschool, distinctly separating it from a private school, homeschool or learning pod.
Those classifications, and how these schools are funded and regulated, affect everything from whether a school must hire certified teachers to how it ensures student safety or civil rights protections. And with more public dollars flowing to private or hybrid learning options through vouchers and education savings accounts — to the detriment of public school funding, some argue — states will need to define these schools and their place in the ecosystem.
States will have to fill the gaps, said Weadé James, senior director of K-12 education policy with the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning policy think tank.
“Accountability can vary wildly. Some microschools aren’t required to have certified teachers, conduct annual assessments, or even guarantee civil rights protections,” said James. “If public voucher dollars are going to a microschool, there has to be some level of oversight and accountability.”
Many microschools aren’t accredited
Microschools defy easy classification, and many advocates argue that’s by design. Don Soifer, CEO of the National Microschooling Center, an industry group, cautions lawmakers against rushing to impose fixed legal definitions.
“Innovation is happening too fast. The moment you define it in law, it becomes obsolete,” Soifer said.
New federal school voucher program poses a quandary for states: Opt in or opt out?

A 2024 sector analysis by the National Microschooling Center — one of the only sources of national data on the topic — found that many schools are operating outside traditional education principles.
In a survey of 400 microschools across 41 states, more than 60% of founders reported they were not currently licensed educators. Eighty-four percent reported their schools were not accredited. Among prospective founders, 48% are licensed educators (though only 14% currently work in public schools), 32% come from non-education fields, and 23% are parents building schools for their own children.
Most microschools (55%) operate under homeschool laws, while others function as private schools (37%), charters (6%) or fall into unique state categories (3%), according to the analysis.
“So, you can be a private or homeschool microschool program, where you aren’t required to provide students with certified teachers, or you aren’t required to conduct annual assessments,” James said.
Often described as “homeschool hybrids” or “small-scale learning communities,” microschools often serve around 16 students or fewer, and tend to cater to families with average or above-average incomes in their area. In some states, microschools have been authorized to receive public funds through voucher programs.
Some critics note that, like private schools, microschools may charge tuition, potentially excluding lower-income families and contributing to educational disparities.
These schools often operate in commercial spaces (41%), private residences (28%) or houses of worship (25%), according to the National Microschooling Center. The center also found the movement is diversifying: 37% of prospective founders are people of color, compared with 27% of current operators.
Because building and zoning codes vary from state to state and locality to locality, many operators may be unaware of the extra costs to meet school codes standards. Fiske recalls difficulties in expanding from Washington, D.C., to Vermont, which has stricter laws on water fountain requirements.
“Most people in the U.S. starting a microschool are doing it under the radar because the regulations to open a licensed school are so intense,” Fiske said. For the new school, she recalled, “it took us forever, and we had to install ADA-compliant toilets and water fountains for just 10 kids in Vermont.”
‘Microschooling is not one thing’
Microschools also operate in a legal gray zone, often outside the traditional K-12 system and subject to a patchwork of state and local policies that can either support or constrain their growth.
Growth has accelerated in conservative-leaning states with robust school choice programs, such as Arizona and Florida. Other states, such as Maryland, New York and North Dakota, have more restrictive homeschool or private school laws.
“Microschooling is not one thing. These schools look different in every state, and the policy frameworks around them vary wildly,” said Soifer, of the National Microschooling Center.
What is classified as a microschool can vary from “10 kids in a basement in Kentucky” to a 200-kid schoolhouse elsewhere.
Public school enrollment continues to fall

Fiske said states need to create a way for operators and parents to know what to expect in a certain state, and help willing operators get the education and business acumen they need to run the schools successfully.
“But if you look at who is starting microschools in the U.S., it’s a lot of millennial parents who may not have any teacher training but wanted to create a learning environment for their children and others in the local community,” said Fiske. “And without efforts by the state to provide some incentives to earn accreditation and information as both a school and a small business, a few of these will find themselves going under.”
Seeking choices
After two decades working in conventional schools in the United States and around the world — including in Brazil, Egypt and Qatar — Justine Wilson turned down a high-paying leadership role at a prestigious private school. Instead, in 2023 she opened Curious and Kind Education, a two-day-a-week microschool in Sarasota, Florida, built around trust, nature-based learning and self-directed play.
Enrollment at Curious and Kind is mostly driven by word of mouth, she said. The program now has a waitlist. And Wilson has seen her enrollment grow from 18 students in her first year to roughly 100 students for the upcoming school year.
“The number of 5-year-olds on my waitlist is shocking,” she said, “and then I realized they’re COVID babies and their parents have really been driving this search for alternative schooling since the pandemic.”
James, of the Center for American Progress, questions whether microschools generally match the quality of traditional public schools, which still educate more than 80% of schoolchildren. She says families may be under the assumption that school choice options equate to better quality.
“We have created an illusion of choice to be quality, and I think a lot of families are seeking various choice options because they associate that with quality. But that doesn’t necessarily mean that where those students are going is any better than where they left,” she said.
“We need to take a closer look at what we are presenting to families,” James said. “It’s not just about having options and having a choice. It’s about having quality choice options.”
That quality, Soifer said, is what microschools are trying to achieve.
“Microschools do very well on the left, on the right … at the top end of the economy and at the fragile end of the income spectrum,” he said. “It’s really a matter of the new economy and a new way of thinking about education.”

(Photo provided by Humanities North Dakota)North Dakota Humanities says its financial future looks more stable after a federal judge indicated the executive branch was wrong to cancel two years of nationwide humanities grants.
The National Endowment for the Humanities was created by Congress in 1965 to support civics, arts and cultural education across the country. A total of 56 humanities councils, including Humanities North Dakota, rely on the agency for money.
Those humanities councils were dealt a significant blow after the federal government in early April walked back hundreds of millions in grant funding earmarked for them by Congress for the 2024 and 2025 fiscal years, according to court records. The National Endowment for the Humanities at the time said it was “repurposing its funding allocations in a new direction in furtherance of the President’s agenda.”
North Dakota Humanities in April said it stood to lose $600,000 in grant money it received for fiscal year 2024 because of the funding cuts. The organization later received $300,000 in private donations to keep its doors open, though it said it still would have to pare down its programming in light of the grant cancellation.
Humanities North Dakota in limbo after loss of federal funding

Oregon U.S. District Judge Michael Simon in a Wednesday order wrote that the executive branch’s decision to defund humanities councils is unlawful and will likely be overturned at a later date. Simon’s order doesn’t reinstate any of the grant money, but it does temporarily prevent the federal government from spending it elsewhere, according to the Federation of State Humanities Councils. 
“With the court’s decision, we’ll begin the process of resuming paused initiatives, reconnecting with community partners, and making responsible financial decisions that reflect both the uncertainty of the past few months and our long-term commitments,” said Brenna Gerhardt, executive director of Humanities North Dakota.
The grant cancellations were one of the many program purges carried out by executive branch agencies at the request of the Department of Government Efficiency. In addition to the funding cuts, the National Endowment for the Humanities this spring laid off roughly 65% of its staff, according to Simon’s order.
Simon’s decision came in a lawsuit against the Department of Government Efficiency and the National Endowment for the Humanities brought by the Federation of State Humanities Councils and one of its members, Oregon Humanities.
In their complaint, the plaintiffs allege the federal government canceled the funding “with no reasoned analysis and with total disregard for the Congressionally mandated role of councils: to ensure that humanities programs reach every part of the United States.”
The National Endowment for the Humanities has said that the grants were pulled because they were identified as promoting subjects like diversity, equity and inclusion, disability accommodation and environmental justice, which President Donald Trump pledged to eliminate in an executive order adopted earlier this year.
Simon said this flies in the face of how Congress wanted the National Endowment for the Humanities to use the grant money. Federal law directs the federal agency to support programs that “reflect the diversity and richness of our American cultural heritage” and “give particular regard to scholars, and educational and cultural institutions, that have traditionally been underrepresented.”
The funding cuts have disrupted funding for causes including an Indigenous language preservation program in Alaska, an end-of-life care department for an Ohio children’s hospital and rural libraries in Oregon, Simon noted in his order.
“From the largest cities to the most rural communities throughout our nation, humanities funding came to a screeching halt,” he wrote.
Phoebe Stein, president of the Federation of State Humanities Councils, in a Wednesday statement applauded Simon’s decision but noted that it still leaves humanities councils underfunded for the time being.
“Many have already laid off staff and canceled vital programs as a result,” Stein said in the announcement.
The National Endowment for the Humanities has argued in court documents that federal regulations allow them to terminate grants at will if they conclude that a grant does not further agency priorities.

President Donald Trump’s phaseout of clean energy tax credits will make solar and wind projects more expensive, but some states are still committed to clean energy mandates. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) The abrupt termination of tax credits for clean energy projects is perhaps the most drastic blow that President Donald Trump has struck in his campaign against wind and solar electricity.
As states brace for the uncertainty ahead, they are scrambling to get pending projects off the ground before the tax credits expire.
“The real opportunities are making sure that the projects in the queue make their deadline,” said Washington Democratic state Sen. Sharon Shewmake, who chairs the Senate Environment, Energy & Technology Committee. “Can we speed that up? Can we make that easier for them?”
Shewmake, and leaders in other states, say they’re focused on fast-tracking permitting decisions and working with regulators to ensure projects can connect to the grid.
“Ironically, one of the impacts of the phaseout is that there’s a rush to speed up the development of some projects in the short run,” said Warren Leon, executive director of the Clean Energy States Alliance, a nonprofit coalition of state energy agencies.
The tax credits were the linchpin for countless wind and solar projects in states aiming to get a large portion of their power from renewable energy. Leaders and advocates in those states say that renewable sources remain the best way to meet their electricity needs. But the loss of the tax credits could mean that residents pay more on their utility bills.




We still need to add electricity in this state, and wind and solar are still the cheapest way to do it.


– Pete Wyckoff, deputy commissioner of energy resources with the Minnesota Department of Commerce



“This will likely kill some projects,” said Matt Abele, executive director of the North Carolina Sustainable Energy Association, an industry-supported nonprofit that backs clean energy policy. “The financial scenario for these projects is built around tax credits that were intended to be in place until the 2030s.”
But once the dust settles, many officials expect state laws and market forces to continue driving the buildout of wind and solar.
“We still need to add electricity in this state, and wind and solar are still the cheapest way to do it,” said Pete Wyckoff, deputy commissioner of energy resources with the Minnesota Department of Commerce. “It’s a blow, but it doesn’t change our energy policy, it doesn’t change what is economically the right thing to do. But it’s a big hit to our ratepayers.”
Tax credits axed
Under the Inflation Reduction Act, which President Joe Biden signed in 2022, developers received a 30% tax credit for investments in zero-emission energy projects, along with a production credit of up to 2.75 cents for every kilowatt-hour of clean electricity generated by the projects. Those tax credits were slated to extend into the 2030s.
State officials and renewable energy industry leaders say the credits have been a major driver in the nation’s rapid buildout of wind and solar, along with corresponding growth in manufacturing jobs.
But the giant domestic policy measure Trump signed on July 4 abruptly ended those tax credits. Under the new law, projects must be up and running by the end of 2027 to qualify for the credits, or start construction by July 4, 2026. Projects that begin construction after that date must be operational by the end of 2027.
Trump has falsely claimed that wind and solar are “expensive and unreliable,” and has at the same time worked to boost fossil fuel production. He has also taken aim at the fact that some renewable energy components are manufactured overseas, calling it a national security threat.
“Projects in early to mid-stage development are deeply in danger if not completely cut off,” said Harry Godfrey, managing director with Advanced Energy United, an industry group focused on energy and transportation. “This administration is finding a variety of ways to pull the rug on wind and solar.”
While there may be a short-term burst of projects before the credits expire, the landscape becomes much more uncertain after that.
“Certainly there will be some projects that are canceled, but the bigger issue is going to be new projects that don’t get started because of the unfavorable environment for them,” said Leon, of the Clean Energy States Alliance.
A slower, costlier transition
Industry leaders say it’s too early to tell just how drastically the loss of the tax credits will slow their deployment of wind and solar. But they say states remain committed to laws that mandate a transition to clean energy. And building fossil fuel power, such as natural gas plants, is still slower and more costly.
“You don’t build a natural gas plant overnight, and there are real supply chain constraints — you can’t even get the parts,” said Amisha Rai, senior vice president of advocacy with Advanced Energy United.
Rai and others noted that the country is seeing a surge in demand for new electricity, driven by the electrification of vehicles and buildings, as well as growth in data centers to support technologies like artificial intelligence.
“Market forces are going to continue to drive development of clean energy, the primary market force being significant demand for new electricity,” said Abele, with the North Carolina group. “It’s not going to come from natural gas, given that turbines are on back order through 2029. Solar, wind and battery storage are the quickest ways to add electrons to the grid.”
Clean energy backers said Trump’s efforts to block solar and wind undermine his “energy dominance” agenda at a time when more power is needed. Ultimately, they believe the loss of the tax credits will cause higher electricity bills.
“Just by the law of supply and demand, if you have growing demand and you don’t have growing supply to keep up with it, that’s going to lead to higher prices,” Leon said.

According to a report from Energy Innovation Policy & Technology, a nonpartisan think tank, the loss of the tax credits could increase electricity rates 9-18% by 2035, raising household energy costs by $170 annually.
Godfrey, the industry advocate, said that wind and solar projects may be canceled once the tax credits expire. But many of those same projects may be revived as rising electricity prices make their costs more viable.
Analysts have noted that the clean energy boom brought on by the Inflation Reduction Act has largely benefited Republican-led states. But some lawmakers fear that developers will now focus their investments on Democratic states, where laws mandating a transition to renewable sources provide more market certainty.
“We’ll probably see more of the investment go towards blue states that have those sorts of mandates,” said Utah state Sen. Nate Blouin, a Democrat. “That’s a loss for states like Utah, where we were seeing good new tax revenue, and agriculture folks making supplemental income [from wind and solar projects].”
Lawmakers in states that do have mandates say they’re still committed to meeting their goals.
“When I heard that the Inflation Reduction Act was going to be repealed, I was devastated,” said Shewmake, the Washington senator. “But then I started to look at the economics of the situation, and you realize this transition is going to happen. The federal government can slow it down, but this fight isn’t lost.”

(Photo by Shannon Heckt/Virginia Mercury)“Enough is enough,” Jason Woodby said in a crowd of Chesterfield residents at the Department of Environmental Quality’s Aug. 7 informational meeting for a new Dominion Energy gas plant air permit. The utility has said the new plant is necessary to help meet the state’s soaring energy demands. 
Over a hundred community members showed up to the meeting in red shirts to decry the proposed peaker gas plant that Dominion wants to build in their backyard. Their biggest concerns are the cumulative health impacts on the largely low-income and communities of color that surround the plant, which they say have already been breathing in coal dust for decades.
The proposed Chesterfield Energy Reliability Center (CERC), at the site of a former coal-fired plant, is only meant to run 37% of the time during peak energy demand hours. It will be able to power up in a matter of minutes to run for several hours at a time to take the strain off the regional PJM power grid during the hottest and coldest days when energy demands skyrocket.

But environmental groups believe that the company should be focusing on renewable energy as mandated by the Virginia Clean Economy Act. In case filings to the State Corporation Commission, they have proposed other ways for the company to meet energy demands, including through solar, wind, and battery storage.
“This plant is dirty and expensive. No two ways about it. Burning methane is bad for our health,” said Rachel James, an attorney for the Southern Environmental Law Center. “If allowed, this plant would spew out several harmful contaminants, including fine particulate matter, which is one of the most deadly air pollutants.”
 Project background

The 1000-megawatt plant faced some permitting challenges at the original proposed location across the street, prompting Dominion to move it to the Chesterfield Power Station, just north of the Dutch Gap conservation area. The site used to be a coal-fired power station that began to be retired in 2018 and fully ended burning coal in 2023, after burning for over 70 years. The process of removing the ash from the pond on the site is still in progress.
Dominion still facing opposition to natural gas plant proposal after location change

The plant is still operational for gas production through two units that produce about 420 MW of energy. Those portions of the plant are not planned to be part of the peaker usage and will run more than the proposed 37% for the other units.
Dominion officials said this project is critical to meet the exponential growth of power demand – with Virginians expected to be using double the amount of energy they are now by the late 2030s. The CERC will be only used for peak energy demands on the hottest and coldest days of the year, according to Dominion. The plant can be fired up in about 15 minutes in order to help stabilize the grid on those high-use days, when the company gets the call from PJM that additional support for the grid will be needed.
“Our customers are using 5% more power every year, and by the late 2030s our customers will use twice as much power as they use today,” said Jeremy Slayton, a Dominion spokesperson. “…If we don’t do that, there’s going to be a power gap. Power demand will exceed power supply, and there won’t be enough energy for our customers on those hottest and coldest days of the year.”
 Environmental, health concerns

Since the coal-fired plant fully shut down two years ago, air quality has improved for the surrounding communities, according to DEQ. The CERC facility is projected to have significantly less emissions than the coal plant.
Representatives from DEQ at last week’s community meeting also stated that the proposed gas plant is much more efficient than other facilities around the country. It would not significantly raise air pollution compared to the former coal burning.
However, residents feel that since they just started to see air quality improve, they don’t want to see additional pollutants put into the air.
“It seems like Dominion and now DEQ is using the fact that there was this coal ash plant here, running for 70 years, (as) kind of a cover for introducing even more pollution to the same area.  From a community perspective, the fact that this community has been exposed to 70 years of coal pollution doesn’t justify exposing it to more pollution,” Woodby said.
DEQ uses air monitoring both inside the stacks of the plant and locally to ensure  gas plants are meeting the air quality standards. They use the ambient air monitoring to make their assessments, but community members said the monitors are too far away to get an accurate read on the impact of the Chesterfield location and should be placed on the fenceline of the facility. DEQ officials said the modeling for the plant’s emissions and reads on ambient air show the plant will be within the requirements,
Dominion has been working to meet the state’s renewable energy goals laid out in the Virginia Clean Economy Act, according to the company spokesman. The utility has stated that an estimated six methane gas plants in the state will be needed to meet the growing energy demand, on top of renewable energy, to prevent a grid collapse during hot and cold days.
“We are all in, all in on offshore wind, all in on solar. The one thing you’re dealing with renewables like offshore wind and solar, is that they are intermittent resources,” Slayton said. “So those renewables work hand in hand with natural gas to make sure we are able to meet our customers’ power demand so we can keep the lights on for our customers.”
Advocacy groups have taken to the courts over the county allowing the project to move forward with a conditional use permit from 2010 instead of the project needing to apply for a new one. The county said the location was already permitted to be a plant and additional review was not needed. Residents also took issue with the county not doing a site suitability process for the project, with regulators stating the project meets all local ordinances.
“We have determined that the area will be, unless we got something wrong, data will show that it’s going to be suitable from an air pollution perspective,” said Alison Sinclair, an air permit writer for DEQ. “That’s all we can do from the air pollution perspective…That’s why we look to the counties, because they know where everything is and what’s going on in their county.”
Chesterfield County decides to not take up zoning appeal for Dominion’s natural gas plant

Dominion held their own informational open houses about the project in the community despite not having to go through a conditional use permit process that would have required the county’s Board of Supervisors take a new vote on the zoning for the project. Advocates appealed the Chesterfield county decision to accept the old CUP permit in order to force a new vote by the supervisors, but a judge in July 2024 denied the appeal. Advocates said they would not give up their fight.
Dominion and the proposal’s opponents will present their cases to the SCC on Aug. 19. That panel will be tasked with determining if the energy project is necessary for grid reliability as the company claims and if it is a reasonable cost for ratepayers, who will be on the hook for some of the project funding. 
DEQ has published the draft permit for the facility and has opened the public comment period. An official public hearing will be held on Sept. 8, where the community will have their comments officially recorded and submitted to DEQ before the permit is officially approved or denied. 
If the permit is approved and the SCC gives the green light to move forward, Dominion anticipates construction to begin in 2026 and the plant to come online in 2029.",https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_9938-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-11 05:56:32.412755

(Photo courtesy of U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs)In a sweeping policy shift that could reshape labor relations at one of the largest federal agencies, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs has terminated collective bargaining agreements for most of its unionized workforce, citing a need to better serve veterans and implement long-stalled management reforms.
The decision, announced last week, follows an executive order from former President Donald Trump that excludes certain agencies from labor-management relations programs on national security grounds. 
The VA said it acted under that order to end union contracts covering hundreds of thousands of employees represented by five major labor organizations, including the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), the National Association of Government Employees (NAGE), the National Federation of Federal Employees (NFFE), National Nurses United (NNOC/NNU), and the Service Employees International Union (SEIU).
The implications are particularly significant in Virginia, which is home to more than 700,000 veterans and thousands of VA employees working in hospitals, clinics, and benefits offices across the state — including major medical centers in Richmond, Hampton, and Salem. 
The commonwealth also hosts regional benefits offices and serves as headquarters for several federal unions and advocacy organizations.
While the VA will maintain agreements for approximately 4,000 police officers, firefighters and security guards — occupations exempt from the executive order — the vast majority of bargaining-unit employees across the country are now operating without formal union contracts.
The move drew swift criticism from labor groups but was celebrated by Trump allies and VA leadership as a long-overdue realignment of priorities at an agency that serves more than 9 million veterans annually.
“This decision is good news for Veterans, families, caregivers and survivors,” VA Secretary Doug Collins said in a statement. “Too often, unions that represent VA employees fight against the best interests of Veterans while protecting and rewarding bad workers. We’re making sure VA resources and employees are singularly focused on the job we were sent here to do: providing top-notch care and service to those who wore the uniform.”
VA officials said the decision will allow managers to more effectively reward high performers, hold poor performers accountable and eliminate bureaucratic hurdles to hiring and reform. 
According to the agency, more than 1,900 VA employees collectively spent over 750,000 hours on union activity during fiscal year 2024 — time that was compensated with taxpayer dollars. Some employees performing union work earned more than $200,000 annually, the VA noted.
Additionally, the agency cited the use of over 187,000 square feet of VA office and clinical space by union representatives, free of charge, as a significant cost burden. Officials said those resources — which also include union access to government phones and computer systems — should be redirected to patient care and veteran services.
The move also halts payroll deductions for union dues for most employees, a change that took effect on April 25 in compliance with the executive order.
Labor organizations say the agency is turning its back on frontline workers, many of whom are veterans themselves, and warned that terminating collective bargaining agreements will degrade working conditions and compromise patient care.
“This is a direct attack on the rights of the people who care for our nation’s veterans,” Irma Westmoreland, chair of National Nurses United, told Axios. “Without a contract, nurses fear they won’t be empowered to speak up about conditions that put our patients at risk.”
The VA contends that unions have consistently resisted efforts to modernize the agency and hold employees accountable. 
Officials noted that AFGE, NFFE and NNOC/NNU opposed the bipartisan MISSION Act, which expanded veterans’ access to private-sector care. NFFE has also supported repealing the 2017 VA Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act, which was designed to speed disciplinary action against employees and protect whistleblowers.
According to the VA, AFGE collaborated with the administration of former President Joe Biden to reinstate over 100 employees who were fired during Trump’s first term and helped secure nearly $134 million in back pay for more than 1,700 employees dismissed for alleged misconduct.
Labor advocates counter that these laws have been misused to retaliate against whistleblowers and sidestep due process protections, particularly during the Trump administration.
The action makes the VA the first federal agency to fully sever collective bargaining agreements under the Trump-era executive order, a move made possible by language exempting agencies involved in “national security” functions. 
Axios reported that the decision could affect up to 400,000 workers — roughly a quarter of the federal workforce with union protections. 
Though Biden revoked many Trump-era executive orders affecting federal workers upon taking office, this particular directive remained in place. A Trump spokesperson told Axios at the time that the action reflected the Republican’s priorities heading into the 2025 election, where he vowed to focus heavily on veterans’ issues and government accountability.
U.S. Sens. Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, both Virginia Democrats, criticized the move as harmful to the VA’s workforce and counterproductive to its mission. 
“The men and women who work at the VA, many of them veterans themselves, are on the front lines of making sure our nation keeps its promises to those who’ve served,” Warner said in an email Friday. 
He called the decision “shortsighted, counterproductive, and disrespectful to those who’ve worn the uniform,” warning that gutting collective bargaining rights would make it even harder for the agency to recruit and retain skilled professionals amid staffing shortages and rising demand for care. 
Kaine added that “VA employees in Virginia work tirelessly to deliver high-quality care to veterans in our communities,” and said that “diminishing their rights in the workplace will do nothing to strengthen services or improve efficiency — and those should be VA leadership’s real priorities.”
While the full impact of the VA’s action remains to be seen, labor leaders and policy analysts expect legal challenges and a new round of political fights over the balance between government efficiency and worker protections.
For now, the department insists its mission is clear.
“This is about putting veterans first,” said Collins. “And if that means upsetting union bosses who’ve been standing in the way of reform, so be it.”

U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, who’s seeking re-election next year, took to the stage of the 58th annual Silver Elephant Gala and held his cellphone to the microphone so the president could speak to the crowd that twice helped elect him to the White House.
The unexpected call upstaged the main speaker for the event: Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin.
“I will never forget your great state. South Carolina is a special state, and you’ve made it that way,” Trump told the nearly 770 Republicans in attendance.
Graham never mentioned his own campaign for a fifth term. Instead, he let Trump do the talking about his “full endorsement” of South Carolina’s senior senator.
“He’s a great guy. Every time I needed him, he was there for me, so I just won’t forget it,” Trump said on the call, earning whoops from the crowd.
“I don’t think it’s going to be a contest,” Trump added about Graham’s re-election. “I have a feeling you’re going to do very well.”
The surprise call stemmed from the golf course. Graham said he and former U.S. Rep. Trey Gowdy played golf with Trump earlier in the day, though he didn’t say where.
“President Trump is an incredibly good golfer,” he said in introducing the call. “I have never played with anybody that consistent all the time.”

During the three-minute call, Trump also gave shout outs to Gov. Henry McMaster, first lady Peggy McMaster and state GOP Chairman Drew McKissick.
As Trump said goodbye and told attendees to have fun, the crowd clapped and cheered. It was the biggest applause of the night.
Trump carried 55% and 58% of the vote in South Carolina in 2016 and 2024, respectively. And even though he did not win the national race in 2020, Trump took 55% of South Carolinians’ vote that year.
The dinner, which cost donors up to $1,000 for a private pre-dinner reception, is the state party’s largest annual fundraiser. When Trump was the keynote speaker in 2023, he drew a record crowd of more than 1,300 people.
Other past headliners include former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in 2021 and former Vice President Mike Pence in 2008, when he was an Indiana congressman. Then-Gov. Ronald Reagan was the speaker in 1967 for the inaugural Silver Elephant. Other former presidents to give the keynote address include Richard Nixon and George W. Bush.
 Candidates and endorsements

The gala came a day after former Lt. Gov. Andre Bauer suspended his bid to challenge Graham. Bauer announced his exit on social media just one month after launching his campaign.
Bauer’s departure left two Republicans in the race to unseat Graham. Paul Dans of Charleston, who attended the gala, said Graham’s Trump phone stunt “smacked of desperation.”
“It was a very bad miscue by the Graham campaign to try to force feed this endorsement to the people,” Dans, an architect of the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025, told reporters at the event.
Graham wasn’t the only 2026 candidate on stage Saturday.
Three other hopefuls “paid to sponsor for the privilege to come to address you beautiful people this evening,” McKissick announced before handing over the mic.
Attendees heard stump speeches from Attorney General Alan Wilson, who is running for governor; state Sen. Stephen Goldfinch of Murrells Inlet, who is running to replace Wilson as attorney general; and state Sen. Wes Climer of Rock Hill, who is running for Congress to replace another gubernatorial candidate, U.S. Rep. Ralph Norman of the 5th District.
“For those of you that are still on the fence, I just want the opportunity to earn your vote, earn your trust, to earn an opportunity to serve you as your governor,” Wilson told attendees.
Wilson, who’s in his fourth term as attorney general, was the only candidate among those who paid to speak who has an official GOP opponent for the June 2026 primaries.
So far, five Republicans have announced bids to replace McMaster, who can’t run again. Wilson was the first to hold an official launch event, though the race unofficially started soon after the November elections.
“The governor must not only be an agent of reform and change; the governor cannot be an agent of chaos,” he added.
U.S. Rep. Nancy Mace of the coastal 1st District was the latest Republican to announce her bid, but she’s been pummeling her opponents on social media and at GOP events for months. She’s directed most of her ire at Wilson. Mace did not attend the gala.
Two other gubernatorial candidates — Lt. Gov. Pam Evette and Norman, the 5th District congressman — were there but did not address the crowd.
 ‘Know how to win’

In his main address following the campaign speeches, Youngkin invoked the fighting spirit of Revolutionary War hero Francis Marion.
He encouraged South Carolina Republicans to follow the Swamp Fox’s lead heading into the 2026 midterms that will decide whether the GOP will continue to control Congress.
“We don’t follow; we lead. And that is my challenge to all of you,” Youngkin said.
“Francis Marion showed all of us how to keep the fight alive,” he added, noting the country is gearing up to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the American Revolution.
Youngkin pointed to the GOP supermajorities in both South Carolina’s House and Senate as a sign Republicans “know how to win” in the Palmetto state.
“And one of our largest missions in 2026 is to extend the majority in our House of Representatives in Washington,” he said. “That is a top priority.”
Youngkin’s election to governor in November 2021 put a Republican at the helm of the Old Dominion State for the first time in more than a decade.
“When you’re on the losing side, the consequences are dire,” Youngkin said. “When you’re on the winning side, Republicans can unleash prosperity and opportunity and lift up every South Carolinian, every Virginian, and every American. And because of those consequences, we have to continue to go to work.”
In his own race, Youngkin focused on education and tapped into parents’ anger over pandemic policies and classroom lessons in his upset win over former Gov. Terry McAuliffe, who was the former Democratic National Committee chairman and chief fundraiser for the campaigns of Bill and Hillary Clinton.
His winning “parents matter” message helped fuel a GOP focus on parents’ rights.
In the wake of COVID-19, Youngkin said businesses were closing.
“We saw parents shut out of their children’s lives, and they were told boldly that parents should not have a role in determining what was being taught in our schools,” he told Silver Elephant attendees Saturday. “And for nearly a decade, more people were moving out of the Commonwealth of Virginia than were moving in.
“Now, a lot of them were moving here to South Carolina,” Youngkin added to laughter from the crowd. “A lot of them are moving here to South Carolina because South Carolina still believes in common sense conservative values: faith, family, and freedom.”
As for Youngkin, his term expires in January 2026. Virigina’s constitution does not allow governors to hold consecutive terms.
There’s some speculation he could make a bid for president in 2028. No mention of that was made Saturday.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has approved the sale of a coal-fired electricity generator along the Ohio River. The plant is said to be one of the dirtiest in the United States, and its sale from one private equity group to another is raising concerns among environmentalists that its operations won’t become any cleaner.
The groups are heavily invested in the dirtiest forms of power generation and they spent heavily in the last election cycle. That’s raising fears among environmental groups that they’re pushing to roll back regulations in order to make their investments more valuable.
The energy regulatory commission, or FERC, on July 23 approved the sale of the General James M. Gavin Power Plant in Cheshire from Blackstone and ArcLight Capital Partners to Energy Capital Partners, a subsidiary of London-based Bridgepoint. 
All four companies are private equity firms, which pool cash from wealthy people and corporations, buy other companies and then sell all or part of them.
The firms have been accused of ruthlessly seeking profit — often by loading their purchases with debt, selling off the most valuable parts, declaring bankruptcy, and walking away. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Last year, companies owned by private equity firms made up 75 of 697 — or 11% — of all corporate bankruptcies, reported the Private Equity Stakeholder Project, a nonprofit watchdog group. 
Most — 27 of 48 — bankruptcies involving liabilities of $500 million or more were filed by companies owned by private equity firms, the report said. 
Continued private equity ownership of Ohio’s Gavin Plant is particularly concerning to environmental groups because a 2023 analysis by the Sierra Club found it to be the deadliest in the United States. 
It estimated that due to the toxicity of its emissions and because of the direction of prevailing winds, the plant causes 224 premature deaths in the eastern United States each year.
It will also cost about $40 million to make the plant compliant with rules regarding the storage of toxic coal ash. Advocates fear that the plant’s private equity owners won’t work to make the plant cleaner.
“It is irresponsible for FERC to approve the sale of the Gavin coal plant to yet another private equity firm, (Energy Capital Partners), with so few conditions, knowing that pollution from the plant causes adverse health outcomes across the eastern U.S.,” Ryan Leitner of the Private Equity Stakeholder’s Project said in a written statement. “It is now incumbent upon ECP and its parent company, Bridgepoint, to commit to responsibly transitioning Gavin away from coal while maintaining reliability.” 
Environmental groups have been pushing for the owners of the 50-year-old, 2,600 megawatt plant to convert it to cleaner fuels or retire it altogether.
“Gavin consistently ranks as one of the worst and deadliest coal plants in the country,” Neil Waggoner of the Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal Campaign said in a written statement. “Continuing to operate it with no plan for transition to clean energy is irresponsible. ECP should commit to a plan to end coal burning operations at the Gavin plant.” 
Energy Capital Partners didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment, but it seems unlikely that it would voluntarily retire the plant. Signal Ohio reported last month that electricity prices are spiking in Ohio because of demand from the state’s booming fleet of data centers.
Private equity firms are highly invested in companies that produce or consume fossil fuels. The group Private Equity Climate Risks estimates that private equity-owned companies are responsible for 1.17 gigatons of emissions annually.
And after they spent heavily last election cycle, the administration of President Donald Trump has been removing climate rules. That presumably makes private-equity-owned fossil fuel companies more valuable.
Last month, the Trump EPA proposed to scrap the Environmental Protection Agency’s 2009 Endangerment Finding, which compels the agency to regulate greenhouse gases.
That’s happening after some in the private equity world supported Trump and his vice president, Ohio’s JD Vance.
Blackstone was the 10th-largest contributor to Vance’s PAC, Working for Ohio, according to OpenSecrets.com, donating $20,000 since 2019.
And Blackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman in May gave a crucial early endorsement of Trump.

(Photo by Bill Oxford/ Getty Images)Legislation that came out of the committee focused on local government was often criticized this past session for being frivolous at a time when Maine faced pressing budget issues and mounting health care costs. 
Amid the proposals to appoint a new state amphibian and designate a new state anthem, there was one bill that didn’t draw much attention but ended up being the second most lobbied bill in the Maine Legislature this year, with outside groups spending nearly $50,000 talking to lawmakers about the measure. 
That bill was LD 556, which prohibits municipalities from banning a particular energy source. Gov. Janet Mills signed it into law on July 1. The Republican-sponsored legislation divided members of Mills’ own party as it straddled key priorities including local control, rising costs for Maine households and environmental issues. 
Conversations with both proponents and critics of the bill highlight how constituents’ concerns over rising energy costs ultimately opened the door for a new law that some worry could hamper local efforts to phase out fossil fuels. 
“A similar bill having been defeated a couple years ago, we just weren’t expecting it to pop up again,” said Nick Janzen, director of policy and partnerships for Maine Conservation Voters, whose disclosures show a sharp uptick in lobbying activity after the group realized it was gaining momentum and had some Democratic support. 
Assistant Senate Minority Leader Matt Harrington (R-York) introduced a similar bill back in the 131st Legislature, but it was rejected by both the Maine House of Representatives and Senate. During the committee process, that bill was amended to allow towns to incentivize certain energy sources, as well as leave room for restrictions rooted in safety or zoning issues. 
How key climate, environmental bills fared in Augusta this past session

The bill that succeeded in the 132nd Legislature mirrored that amended language. Harrington called it “instrumental in showing that bipartisanship can happen in Augusta.” 
During the March 24 public hearing before the State and Local Government Committee, Harrington argued it would not only safeguard a homeowner’s ability to choose how to heat their home, but it would also aid affordable housing construction by allowing developers to choose affordable energy systems.
After passing the committee, the bill sat on the Senate’s list of unfinished business for about a month and a half. When it was finally taken up in the final days of session, the Senate voted 17-17, with one member excused, rejecting the measure. The House then voted 81-67 in support, sending it back to the upper chamber, which ultimately backed the bill by a vote of 17-16, with two members excused. 
Concerns about environment
Rep. Dan Ankeles (D-Brunswick) said the bill was marketed to legislators as a tool for preserving consumer choice in an energy market where costs are high. But he also said there was some complacency in his caucus because the bill had been “beaten over and over again.”
“Had we sought to explain to people in our caucus earlier that this was incredibly dangerous, had we flagged this months ahead of time and understood that there was an actual threat of this passing, I think perhaps maybe we could have fended it off this time,” Ankeles said. 
On the House floor, Ankeles said he feared LD 556 would be “one of the more environmentally unfriendly bills” sent to the governor’s desk this year. He told Maine Morning Star he stands by those comments and believes it is a “terrible bill.”
Environmental groups were also caught on the back foot. 
The Environmental Priorities Coalition, a statewide alliance of 39 conservation, climate action, and public health organizations, designated the previous iteration of the bill a priority in the 131st Legislature. But Janzen said because that bill had been defeated by a safe margin in both chambers, the bill wasn’t on the coalition’s radar in December when it selected what bills to hone in on this session. 
However, after the public hearing, Maine Conservation Voters spent significant time lobbying against the bill because Janzen said it blocks local communities from achieving clean energy goals and protects fossil fuel infrastructure. 
“Under the cloak of words like ‘choice’ and ‘freedom,’ [LD 556] puts the state’s thumb on the scale for the fossil fuel industry, despite common knowledge that it contributes to climate change, poor health outcomes, air pollution, rising ocean temperature, sea level rise, extreme weather events, and more,” said former Director of Government Affairs Cathy Breen in her testimony to the committee.

Multiple House Democrats who opposed the bill also expressed fears that it would block environmental progress. Rep. Sue Salisbury of Westbrook, who co-chairs the local government committee, said on the floor it “hamstrings Maine’s climate response,” while Rep. Sophie Warren of Scarborough said the bill was “propped up and fueled by the fossil fuel industry.”
Heating oil and propane companies, including Dead River Company and Maritime Energy, testified in support of the bill. 
Also, at the same time environmental groups like Maine Conservation Voters were frantically reaching out to lawmakers about the legislation, fossil fuel interests were also throwing money behind the bill. 
Megan Diver, a lobbyist for Maine Energy Marketers Association, which represents heating oil, propane, biofuels and motor fuels sellers, submitted five reports where she records some level of compensation (less than $1,000) for lobbying on LD 556. The disclosures also show the organization spent almost $50,000 on what is described as grassroots lobbying, spending $27,500 on social media and website design and $20,495 in targeted texts and calls to action. 
The law’s passage was also celebrated by the National Propane Gas Association.
Maine has historically been highly dependent on heating oil, but that has been declining in recent years. In 2010, seven in 10 homes used heating oil. That dropped to just over half of homes in 2023, according to a news release from Mills’ office last October attributing some of that decrease to the state’s effort to transition people to electric heat pumps. 
Proponents of the bill countered those concerns by pointing out that the now-law won’t restrict a town from incentivizing a particular energy source, including heat pumps, solar or other renewables. 
However, Janzen argued towns don’t have the financial ability to offer effective incentives like tax credits or rebates that exist on the state level. 
While there weren’t examples cited during committee meetings or in interviews with Maine Morning Star of specific Maine towns actively seeking to ban an energy source for heating purposes, bill supporters pointed to the climate action plan for Portland and South Portland, which says those communities are looking for ways to eliminate the use of fossil fuels to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 
A question of local control
But environmental issues weren’t the only factor for lawmakers. There was also debate as to whether this decision should lie with local or state officials. 
Maine has been a “home rule” state since 1969, when an amendment was added to the state constitution that gave towns and cities broad power to create their own ordinances. Home rule allows residents more control over what their individual communities look like.
That authority is the reason why the Maine Municipal Association, which offers professional services to municipalities and local governments, opposed the bill, said Director of Advocacy and Communications Kate Dufour. Though the Legislature is allowed to prohibit certain action from municipal governments, Dufour said her organization felt this legislation would erode local control.
“We presented our thoughts with respect to home rule authority and the ability of the residents of the state of Maine to make decisions that suit their needs and unfortunately, that message did not prevail,” Dufour said.
The bill’s lobbying report mentions a couple lawmakers that the group spoke with directly, both of whom Dufour said are current municipal officials. Dufour said it’s not uncommon for the organization to participate in the legislative process to provide a municipal perspective.










We presented our thoughts with respect to home rule authority and the ability of the residents of the state of Maine to make decisions that suit their needs and unfortunately, that message did not prevail.


– Kate Dufour, Maine Municipal Association


Harrington said many legislators were hung up on the idea of this bill being a local control issue, but he sees it as “the ultimate local control,” because it ensures that homeowners aren’t being told how they can or can’t heat their homes.
He also noted that the Legislature passed other bills limiting local authority, including LD 731, which prohibits municipalities from barring homeless shelters, but maintains their ability to regulate those facilities. 
Since Republicans often defer to local control when making policy decisions in Augusta, Rep. Ann Matlack (D-St. George), who opposed the bill, said on the House floor it’s ironic that the other side of the aisle is “anti-home rule” on this issue.
Ankeles described the legislation as a “blunt instrument” that gives veto power over local energy policies to the fossil fuel industry.
Sen. Joe Baldacci (D-Penobscot), who co-sponsored the legislation, believes local control is important on some issues, but said in this case he felt the public interest outweighed that authority. He argued that this sort of policy isn’t unprecedented, pointing to a statute that says municipalities can’t ban solar on residential property.
Additionally, the new law avoids a patchwork of more than 400 different energy policies across the state. Baldacci argued that uniformity could help stabilize energy prices for Mainers.
Why now?
While lawmakers couldn’t point to one factor that made the legislation successful this time around, energy prices were a throughline. 
Energy prices in Maine have increased in recent years for a variety of reasons, such as increased recovery costs from the series of winter storms that ravaged the state two years ago. But the biggest factor has been the volatility of electricity supply prices, in particular natural gas, said Phil Bartlett, chairman of the Public Utilities Commission. 
Data from the Office of Public Advocate show that residential customers’ bills increased by 20.7% in Central Maine Power territory and nearly 12% in the Versant Bangor Hydro district between June 2024 and June 2025. There was also a 15% increase for residential customers in the Versant Maine Public District, which is in the northern part of the state. 
Harrington pointed to the law’s ability to preserve energy choice at a time when the cost of heating homes is so front of mind for people. Hearing about that from their constituents probably influenced lawmakers when voting on this bill. 
“Full autonomy was the real nexus of the bill,” he told Maine Morning Star. 
Baldacci, who co-chairs the State and Local Government Committee, attributed its passage to “sound policy and luck.” 
Baldacci said his argument to his Democratic colleagues was that low- and middle-income residents are the ones who could be most hurt by policies like a ban on propane because they are least able to make those adjustments.
Once the bill got to Mills’ desk, it was unlikely to receive a veto, due to an energy choice pledge she signed when running for reelection in 2022. 
Maine Energy Marketers Association, which has been working on this issue for several years, had asked candidates running for state and federal office in 2022 and 2024 to sign a pledge promising to support legislation that preserved a Mainer’s ability to choose how to heat their homes, explained President and Chief Executive Officer Charlie Summers.
Summer also said a large portion of state legislators also signed the pledge during the 2024 election cycle. Baldacci, along with Senate Minority Leader Trey Stewart (R-Aroostook), participated in the campaign last year. 
Summers, whose organization had spent thousands of dollars texting voters about the legislation, said the bill’s success this year could be attributed to the time it can take legislators to become educated about a bill or issue. 
Summers said in addition to protecting a Mainer’s ability to choose how to heat their home, the new law also prevents a household that may use a mix of natural gas, wood heat or some other heating mechanisms in long Maine winters from relying on one source of energy.
“It doesn’t allow for all our eggs to be put in one basket,” he said.

States have led the way in regulating kratom, and now federal officials want to ban 7-OH, a powerful compound found in some kratom products. (Photo by Amanda Hernández/Stateline)For years, state lawmakers have taken the lead on regulating kratom — the controversial herbal supplement used for pain relief, anxiety and opioid withdrawal symptoms. Some states have banned it entirely. Others have passed laws requiring age limits, labeling and lab testing.
At least half of the states and the District of Columbia have enacted some form of regulation on kratom or its components — building a patchwork of policies around a product largely unaddressed by the federal government.
But that may soon change. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is pushing to ban 7-hydroxymitragynine, or 7-OH — a powerful compound found in small amounts in kratom and sometimes concentrated or synthesized in products sold online, at smoke shops or behind gas station counters.
Federal health officials announced last month that the compound poses serious public health risks and should be classified as a Schedule I controlled substance, alongside heroin and LSD.
The move marks a significant shift in how federal regulators are approaching kratom, which they attempted to ban in 2016. It also has sparked debate about how the change could impact the growing 7-OH industry and its consumers.
This year, at least seven states have considered bills to tighten kratom regulations, including proposals for bans, age restrictions and labeling requirements.
Kratom, which originates from the leaves of a tree native to Southeast Asia, can have a wide range of mental and bodily effects, according to federal officials, addiction medicine specialists and kratom researchers. Reports of fatal kratom overdoses have surfaced in recent years, though kratom is often taken in combination with other substances.
Kratom and 7-OH are distinct products with separate markets, but they are closely connected. 7-OH is a semi-synthetic compound derived from kratom and only emerged on the market in late 2023, while kratom itself has been available for decades.











This is a public health crisis waiting to happen.


– Christopher R. McCurdy, professor of medicinal chemistry at the University of Florida



Leading kratom researchers also say more research is needed to fully understand the long-term effects of using both substances.
“There’s much we don’t know, unfortunately, on all sides,” said Christopher R. McCurdy, a professor of medicinal chemistry at the University of Florida. McCurdy is a trained pharmacist and has studied kratom for more than 20 years.
Research suggests kratom may help with opioid withdrawal and doesn’t seem to cause severe withdrawal on its own. Smaller amounts seem to act as a stimulant, while larger doses may have sedative, opioidlike effects. Very little is known about the risks of long-term use in humans, according to McCurdy.
As for 7-OH, it shows potential for treating pain, but it hasn’t been studied in humans, and it may carry a high risk of addiction. Researchers don’t yet understand how much is safe to take or how often it should be used, McCurdy told Stateline.
While some leading kratom experts agree that kratom and 7-OH should be regulated, they caution that placing 7-OH under a strict Schedule I classification would make it much harder to study — and argue it should instead be classified as Schedule II like some other opioids.
A federal survey from 2023 estimated that about 1.6 million Americans age 12 and older used kratom in the year before the study. The American Kratom Association, a national industry lobbying group, estimated in 2021 that between 11 million and 16 million Americans safely consume kratom products each year.
Since gaining popularity in recent years, 7-OH has appeared in a growing number of products. Some researchers and addiction medicine specialists say many consumers, especially those new to kratom, sometimes don’t understand the difference between products.
“It’s a pure opioid that’s available without a prescription, so it’s akin to having morphine or oxycodone for sale at a smoke shop or a gas station,” McCurdy said. “This is a public health crisis waiting to happen.”
Federal crackdown targets 7-OH, not kratom
In late July, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommended that the federal Drug Enforcement Administration place 7-OH in Schedule I, citing a high potential for abuse. The classification would not apply to kratom leaves or powders with naturally occurring 7-OH.
“We’re not targeting the kratom leaf or ground-up kratom,” FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said at a news conference. “We are targeting a concentrated synthetic byproduct that is an opioid.”
Makary acknowledged that there isn’t enough research or data to fully understand how widespread 7-OH’s use or impact may be. Still, he said the Trump administration wants to be “aggressive and proactive” in addressing the issue before it grows into a larger public health problem.
States stiffen penalties for fentanyl, despite public health concerns

While only small amounts of 7-OH occur naturally in the kratom plant, federal officials have raised concerns about U.S. products containing synthetic or concentrated forms of the compound because it’s more potent than morphine and primarily responsible for kratom’s opioidlike effects.
The FDA’s recommendation to schedule 7-OH will now go to the DEA, which oversees the final steps of the process — including issuing a formal proposal and opening a public comment period.
If finalized, the rule could affect both companies selling enhanced kratom products and consumers in states where those products are currently legal.
The DEA backed off scheduling kratom compounds in 2016 after widespread public opposition.
Kirsten Smith, an assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Johns Hopkins University who is studying kratom’s effects in humans, said she was surprised by the FDA’s push to schedule 7-OH.
“We don’t really have a public health signal of a lot of adverse events for either kratom or for 7-OH at this time,” she told Stateline. “I was, frankly, always surprised that kratom was pushed toward scheduling at an earlier time point. … I don’t know that we have data to support scheduling even now.”
Still, some advocacy groups, including the Holistic Alternative Recovery Trust, argue the push to schedule 7-OH is driven more by corporate interests than public health, suggesting the kratom industry is trying to sideline competition from 7-OH products.
“We think that this is just happening because of the legacy kratom manufacturers losing market share and wanting to gin up a crisis with this,” said Jeff Smith, the national policy director for the group, who said he has used 7-OH for sleep and pain management.
While his organization supports regulation and safe consumption, members worry the federal government’s move could drive people to riskier substances or push the market underground.
“It’s made a profound difference in my life,” Smith said. “We think it would be tragic to cut it off based on such a paucity of data when there’s so much potential for this product to help people.”
Public health concerns
Federal health officials say a key concern is the growing use of kratom and 7-OH products among teens and young adults.
Some officials and addiction medicine specialists have pointed out that these products often come in flavors and packaging designed to appeal to younger buyers, with few controls over where or how they’re sold. In some states without clear regulations, kratom and 7-OH products are available at gas stations or online, sometimes without any age verification.

“Whenever you go into a gas station and even though it’s behind the glass, it’s kind of eye level, and it has all of these bright colors — it has all of these things that really attract the visual of a kiddo,” said Socorro Green, a prevention specialist with Youth180, a nonprofit focused on youth substance use prevention in Dallas.
Green added that kratom and 7-OH products may be even more accessible to young people in rural communities, where gas stations and convenience stores are often among the few available retailers.
Some researchers and experts say that certain products may not clearly or accurately disclose their 7-OH content and are sometimes marketed or mistaken for traditional kratom.
As Kratom Use Surges, Some States Enact Bans

Some cities, counties and states have responded by banning kratom or raising the minimum purchase age to 18 or 21. But in many areas, enforcement remains inconsistent, and some addiction specialists say clearer federal and state guidance is needed — especially as more people are using kratom and 7-OH to manage pain, anxiety or withdrawal symptoms on their own.
“There needs to be some kind of oversight, including some way of maybe helping to ensure that people know what they’re getting,” said Terrence Walton, the executive director and chief executive officer of NAADAC, the Association for Addiction Professionals.
State regulations
At least seven states have considered or enacted legislation this year related to kratom — ranging from age restrictions and labeling requirements to outright bans.
In New York, lawmakers passed two bills: one requiring warning labels and prohibiting kratom products from being labeled as “all natural,” and another raising the minimum purchase age to 21. Neither has been sent to the governor.
In Colorado, a new measure, which was signed into law in May, prohibits kratom from being sold in forms that resemble candy or appeal to children, increases labeling requirements, limits concentrations of 7-OH, and bans the manufacture and distribution of synthetic or semi-synthetic kratom.
In Mississippi, a new law that took effect in July raised the minimum purchase age for kratom to 21. It also bans synthetic kratom extracts and products with high concentrations of 7-OH. Lawmakers in Montana and Texas introduced similar legislation this year, but neither proposal advanced.
Louisiana is the latest state to enact a kratom ban, which took effect Aug. 1. Meanwhile, in July, Rhode Island became the first state to reverse its ban. The new law establishes a regulatory framework for the manufacturing, sale and distribution of kratom products, set to take effect in April 2026.
As of this year, Washington, D.C., and seven states — Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Louisiana, Rhode Island (until April 2026), Vermont and Wisconsin — have banned kratom. At least half of U.S. states now regulate kratom or its components in some way.

Brian Kemp's decision to back Derek Dooley in the GOP primary in next year's U.S. Senate race in Georgia is conjuring up memories of the governor's decision to appoint Kelly Loeffler to the Senate in 2019. Jill Nolin/Georgia Recorder (2020 file photo)Stop me if you’ve heard this story before.
Gov. Brian Kemp needs a U.S. Senate candidate. He promises to work with the White House toward a candidate both he and President Donald Trump can get behind. The governor then decides to go his own route and throws his full support behind a little-known candidate. His pick frustrates the White House and divides the Republican base ahead of a pivotal race.
By backing Derek Dooley for U.S. Senate, the governor is again finding himself on a collision course with the White House as he hedges his bets on a blank-slate candidate.
Kemp, who was his party’s dream challenger to take on Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff before ultimately declining to run, had committed to working with Trump’s team toward finding a consensus candidate. The governor told donors to keep their “powder dry” and made several trips to Washington to discuss the race with the White House and Senate Republicans.
But over the summer, word began spreading that Dooley was weighing a bid with Kemp’s support. A former coach at Tennessee and the son of Georgia coaching giant Vince Dooley, Derek Dooley began lining up a team that included many of the governor’s top advisers.
Kemp even called other candidates to tell them that he would not be supporting their campaigns as he works to boost his longtime friend. While he was able to nudge Insurance Commissioner John King out of the race, his involvement appears to have not only “p—-d off” the president’s inner circle but emboldened other candidates: U.S. Rep. Buddy Carter (R-St. Simons Island) said he wasn’t going anywhere, and U.S. Rep. Mike Collins (R-Jackson) announced his own bid the next week.
Both Collins and Carter are competing for the MAGA lane in a primary almost certain to be dominated by Trump and his supporters, while Dooley works to prove himself as a reliable conservative who can bridge the divide between the party’s two factions.
It’s an eerily familiar situation for Kemp, who found himself in a nearly identical situation in 2019 after the resignation of longtime U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson. Despite being urged by the White House and conservative activists to appoint a more Trump-aligned figure, Kemp went his own route and appointed businesswoman and Republican donor Kelly Loeffler.
Loeffler tried to make inroads with the president’s supporters, but doubts about her conservative credentials — and tenuous ties to Georgia — seemed to follow her wherever she went. And U.S. Rep. Doug Collins (not related to Mike Collins), who was Trump’s preferred choice for the coveted appointment, campaigned for the seat anyway.
The two spent most of the campaign trying to out-right one another, driving up each other’s unfavorable ratings and dividing the Republican base in the process. Loeffler ultimately finished second in the top-two primary but was then defeated by now-Sen. Raphael Warnock (D) after failing to get the party back on a winning message.
This time around, Kemp is again hedging his bets on a blank-slate Senate candidate with thin (or questionable) ties to the Peach State. Dooley’s father might be an icon in Athens, but Derek Dooley has spent the majority of his coaching career outside of Georgia.
And like Loeffler, Dooley is sure to face questions about his voting trail. He hasn’t voted in many recent elections or Republican primaries and declined to declare his affiliation in states that have party registration. His only known political footprint is a $5,500 contribution to Kemp’s campaign.
His opponents wasted no time going on the attack. Collins’ campaign mocked Dooley by sharing a video of the Volunteers’ controversial loss to the Louisiana Tigers in 2010, when the Tigers were awarded an untimed down at the end of regulation after a too-many-men penalty against Dooley’s defense.
Collins’ team shared a separate ad taking aim at Dooley with a simple but potent line of attack: “Never fights. Never wins. Never Trump.”
Carter also thinks Dooley is ill-equipped to take on the first-term Ossoff. “This is serious stuff now — I don’t want to hear about, you know, we’re just going to put this to a popularity contest. That’s not what this is,” Carter said of his rival. “You got to have somebody who can go toe to toe with this kid, and I’m that person who can go toe to toe with him.”
Democrats also plan to make Dooley’s coaching career the centerpiece of their attacks, with party chair Charlie Bailey quickly labeling him as a “failed and fired former Tennessee football coach.”
“We’ll see what’s harder for Dooley — answering for a Trump bill that strips health care for 750,000 Georgians, or remembering which SEC team to root for,” Bailey said in a statement.
So as Kemp places all his eggs in the Dooley basket, he must keep in mind that he is doing so with a lot less capital than he had when he appointed Loeffler. With just a year left in his term and no (immediate) plans to run for office again soon, he has a lot less political leverage to wield over his legislative allies, many of whom are supporting Collins and are keenly aware of which direction their party is going.
What’s clear is that this Republican infighting in what had traditionally been a red state will play right into Democrats’ hands. As the Ossoff campaign asked in an email:
“Didn’t Republicans learn their lesson the last time they tried to oust a Democratic Senator in Georgia?”

As the Trump administration ramps up deportations nationwide, a new Arkansas law requires law enforcement agencies across the state to aid federal immigration authorities.
The law, which went into effect Tuesday, requires sheriffs to apply to a program with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) that trains and certifies officers to serve immigration warrants on undocumented people already being held in county jails for other reasons.
But some agencies, including the Arkansas State Police, are going much further than the new state law requires. They are signing up for a different type of partnership with ICE that allows cops to stop people on the street, question them about their immigration status and potentially arrest them for deportation proceedings.
This program, which ICE calls its “task force model,” was discontinued during the Obama administration amid lawsuits over racial profiling but revived earlier this year under Trump.
On July 7, ICE signed off on a memorandum of agreement with Arkansas State Police Director Mike Hagar that gives participating troopers the “power and authority to interrogate any alien or person believed to be an alien as to his right to be or remain in the United States.” Troopers don’t need warrants to make these arrests “if the officer has reason to believe the alien to be arrested is in the United States in violation of law and is likely to escape before a warrant can be obtained,” the task force agreement says.




Cindy Murphy, an Arkansas State Police spokesperson, said Thursday that no troopers are participating in the task force program as of now. (That may be because officers are required to undergo training first. ICE’s website says task force officer nominees must “complete a 40 hour online course covering, among other things, scope of authority, immigration law, civil rights law, cross-cultural issues, liability issues, complaint procedures and obligations under federal law.”)




Once the training is complete, though, participating troopers will have the authority to make immigration-related arrests on their own, even without an ICE agent being present.
That “will be up to the discretion of the trained trooper,” Murphy said. The program is expected to eventually operate in all areas of the state.



“Arkansas State Police looks forward to working with federal immigration officials through the 287(g) program to protect Arkansans from violent, criminal illegal immigrants,” Murphy said.



Immigration violations are typically civil offenses, not criminal ones, and ICE data shows the agency has arrested an increasing number of unauthorized immigrants in recent months who don’t have criminal charges or convictions. Axios reported in July that non-criminal ICE arrests rose in Arkansas last month, drawing from federal data obtained by the UC Berkeley School of Law’s Deportation Data Project. The New York Times reported in June that the daily rate of arrests made by ICE in Arkansas had jumped by 176% between Jan. 20 and June 10 when compared to 2024.
Murphy didn’t address a question from the Arkansas Times about whether the Arkansas State Police will arrest people solely for violations of civil immigration law, even if there’s no alleged criminal offense at play. She also didn’t answer questions about how the state police will determine who to ask about their immigration status or how the agency will avoid the racial profiling concerns that dogged ICE’s task force program in the past.



The cost to the state police is expected to be “minimal,” Murphy said, “as we already have training facilities and staffing.”



Arkansas isn’t the only red state to embrace the newly revived task force model. ICE’s website shows agencies overseeing state police departments in states including Missouri, Tennessee, Oklahoma, Louisiana and Florida have recently signed task force agreements. ProPublica reported in June that state troopers in Tennessee have assisted with large-scale ICE operations in Nashville by pulling over drivers.
Hundreds of local law enforcement agencies around the country are also participating in the task force program as of August, including five in Arkansas: the Baxter County Sheriff’s Office, the Miller County Sheriff’s Office, the Lafayette County Sheriff’s Office, the Texarkana Police Department and the police department in Hampton, a south Arkansas town of about 1,200.
All of those agreements have been signed within the past six weeks, ICE records show.
Though Arkansas state troopers may not yet be actively participating in the task force program, community advocates say they’re already helping out with ICE operations in Northwest Arkansas, which is home to a large immigrant population. Irvin Camacho, the co-founder of a group called the Alliance for Immigrant Respect and Education, or AIRE, said organizers began noticing about three months ago that state police were stopping and arresting an increasing number of people not just on the state highways they routinely patrol, but in other places, too. There have been a number of arrests in Springdale and Rogers, he said.
“Something is happening, because we’re seeing much more state troopers on the regular streets,” Camacho said. “And a lot of the time, when we see those stops, it’s immigrant-presenting people.”
AIRE tracks ICE activity in Northwest Arkansas and the River Valley. The group recently posted a picture to social media showing two alleged plainclothes ICE agents pretending to be shopping at a store in Fort Smith shortly before they reportedly detained a female employee. AIRE posted a video this week of a man in Fort Smith being pulled out of his truck outside of his home by two alleged ICE agents; he was later released, Camacho said, after immigration officials determined the man was in the country legally.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Hagar_Shue_Jones-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-11 05:56:32.412755

It’s an article of faith on the political far right that the Trump administration’s mass immigrant deportation policies will be a boon to U.S. born workers.
A new report from economists at the Economic Policy Institute, however, finds the opposite to be true and that the net impact of mass deportation on employment – both for immigrants and U.S. born workers – is decidedly negative.
Indeed, the administration’s goal of deporting one-million people per year will lead to a loss of nearly six million jobs over the coming years – more than forty percent of them held by U.S. born workers.
To understand why, consider the following: When houses don’t get built because there aren’t enough immigrant workers to roof them, there are fewer jobs for the U.S. born workers who tend to handle more skilled professions like plumbing and electrical work. Other industries will experience similar phenomena.
The bottom line: The report is entitled “Trump’s deportation agenda will destroy millions of jobs,” and it’s a must read for anyone who cares about our economy. Check it out at epi.org.

The last few weeks of summer, heading into Labor Day weekend, can sometimes mean vacations and driving more miles on the road for all people, including teens.
Traffic crashes are the No. 1 cause of death for teens, and the crash rate for teen drivers is disproportionately higher than the share of licensed teen drivers.
In addition to this grim statistic, summer is the riskiest time for teen drivers. The 100 deadliest days represent the period from Memorial Day to Labor Day when the number of fatal crashes involving teen drivers dramatically increases. A third of each year’s teen driver crashes occur during the summer.
We are scholars who research transportation safety and teen driver behavior. Our expertise helps us understand that these 100 days are not just a statistical fluke – they reflect a dangerous intersection of factors such as inexperience and a propensity to take risks.

  More time on the road means more risk for inexperienced drivers. (Photo by Klaus Vedfelt/Digital Vision via Getty Images)
 What makes summer different?

Regardless of the season, some teen drivers engage in risky behaviors that increase their likelihood of a fatal crash, such as getting distracted, driving with friends in the vehicle, driving under the influence, not wearing seat belts and a lack of hazard awareness.
Teens also have more free time in the summer, since most aren’t in school. Combined with the longer days and better weather, teens drive more over the summer. More time on the road means more risk, especially for inexperienced drivers.
Teens may also be more likely to drive after dark during the summer, in comparison to more experienced drivers. But nighttime driving is also when visibility is reduced and crash risks are higher, particularly for teens who haven’t fully developed the skills necessary for night driving. This increased exposure, in addition to teens’ general risky driving tendencies, contributes to the 100 deadliest days for teen drivers.
The increased crash risk for teens over the summer isn’t equally distributed either. Crashes with teen drivers that lead to serious injuries are more likely to occur with male drivers, in rural areas, for those of lower socioeconomic status and for those with disorders, such as attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder.

  Driver’s education programs can be effective, but not all teenagers have access to them. (Photo by Antonio Diaz/iStock via Getty Images)
 Teaching young drivers

Driver’s education programs are the formal method to teach teen drivers the rules of the road.
In driver’s education programs, teens receive information about driver and road safety though classroom and behind-the-wheel instruction in preparation for the licensing exam. Some states require teens to complete a driver’s education course if they want to receive a license under the age of 18. Of teens who have a license, nearly 80% of them have gone through some form of driver’s education.
Though driver’s education programs can be helpful, their effects are not equally felt. In some states, teens and their guardians must pay out of pocket for driver’s education courses to obtain a license. This makes driver’s education and, as a consequence, obtaining a driver’s license inequitable.
There are also driving school deserts – areas where the poverty rate is 20% or above and there are no behind-the-wheel driver education courses within a 10- to 15-minute drive. This makes driver education courses inaccessible. Many of these driving school deserts happen to be in areas with high populations of minorities.
Over 20 years ago, graduated driver licensing was introduced to reduce teen crash rates. This is a phased licensing system wherein teen drivers are restricted in terms of when, where and with whom they can drive until they turn 18. Such a system allows teens to gradually learn and gain experience with driving over time.
Graduated driver licensing has been implemented in all 50 states, and it has been shown to reduce teen driver crash rates. However, its effectiveness is limited to those who participate in the system. A large number of teens are unlicensed and are of low socioeconomic status. Many of these unlicensed teens forgo the entire process and remain unlicensed but still drive, well into their 20s when the graduated driver licensing restrictions are lifted.

 Making summer safer

There are two things people can do to turn the 100 deadliest days into the 100 safest days.
First, it is important that communities offer free supplementary training programs for teen drivers, because becoming a safe and responsible teen driver shouldn’t be limited to those with resources. As one example, in collaboration with industry partners, we have developed a program called Risk-ATTEND. It is a free, online, evidence-based program that teaches teen drivers how to anticipate risks while driving. Our research has shown that programs such as these can improve teen driving skills and may be especially effective for teen drivers in high-poverty areas.
Second, our research has shown that parents and guardians still play an important role in influencing teen driver behavior. Studies show that teens mirror the behaviors they observe: If they see adults text and drive, they’re more likely to do the same.
Once teenagers become old enough to drive, it is also important to establish rules and guidelines about expectations to establish clarity and accountability. Written agreements or checklists can address high-risk conditions such as nighttime driving, driving with other young passengers, phone use and adherence to speed limits.
Systems to help monitor and enforce rules have been shown to be effective in improving teen driver behavior. One such program is Checkpoints, which is a Connecticut-based program in which families agree to limit teen driving during high-risk conditions. Teens face consequences for violating these limits, such as a temporary loss of driving privileges. However, the limits are gradually lifted as they gain driving experience.

 More than rules matter

Ultimately, preventing crashes in the summer and beyond extends beyond mere adherence to regulations. Avoiding them fundamentally hinges on cultivating a robust safety culture that emphasizes a collective commitment to risk reduction and continuous improvement in driving practices.
For teens, the summer months present unique challenges and opportunities.
Drawing on best practices, such as training programs, teens can build essential skills in varied conditions before gaining full, unsupervised privileges.

Here, she talks during a meeting last spring. (File photo by Annmarie Timmins/New Hampshire Bulletin)Tara Ryan was only seven weeks pregnant with her first child when she secured slots on four child care waitlists. Even then, her daughter didn’t get a full-time space until she was 1.
Now expecting a son through in vitro fertilization, Ryan said the first to know about her embryo transfer was the child care center, “so that we could secure a child care spot for him” — more than a year out from when they’ll need it. The price tag to have both children at the facility is over $50,000, though they’re sitting on waitlists at two less-expensive options.
“It’s unaffordable to us,” said Ryan, of Durham, a founder of the state chapter of Chamber of Mothers, a nonprofit, grassroots group focused on issues such as parental leave, maternal health, and child care. “Like, who can afford that for child care? I just, I don’t even know who can, but we’re gonna figure it out. We have to figure it out.”
Her story is emblematic of a child care system in New Hampshire and beyond that gobbles up household incomes while providing few options for families and low wages for workers as the average provider operates on razor-thin profit margins. Amid a busy budget session, New Hampshire lawmakers directed some attention to the topic, though early care and education issues made up only a small sprinkle of bills in a sea of more than 1,100 weighed in Concord this year.
While advocates and lawmakers involved in the issues came out of the session with some wins, they felt the state had a long way to go in making a dent in addressing affordability and access. Several said New Hampshire needed to bring in more revenue to make lasting, systemic changes to the child care issues plaguing the state.
The new budget will allow additional federal dollars to be routed to the child care scholarship program, a state-federal partnership that more families have become eligible for in the last year with an expanded income cap, should the funds be needed to prevent a waitlist. 
The Legislature also greenlit a pilot program, coming in 2026, that aims to cut down on administrative burdens for the scholarship for families and providers. It would provide a presumptive eligibility period for families after an initial screening, allowing earlier access to scholarship funds while they complete the application process. 
Lawmakers also hope to use $15 million in federal dollars over two fiscal years for a child care workforce grant program, but it remains unclear whether the federal government will allow the money to be used for that purpose.
In other action, a new law will include pending charges, instead of just convictions, in criminal record checks for child care workers and dissolves the child care licensing fund into the general fund. Sen. Howard Pearl, a Loudon Republican who sponsored the enacting Senate Bill 22, said the measure was requested by the state Department of Health and Human Services. 
Also this session, the Legislature rejected a bill that would’ve provided property-tax relief and school building aid to some child care agencies. 
In a statement through her office, Gov. Kelly Ayotte emphasized the action related to the scholarship program, and also highlighted $1 million that will go to the state’s community college system for creating pathways for child care workforce training. She said helping families access affordable child care was a “critical need and an important part of ensuring we remain the best in the nation for economic opportunity.”
“Looking ahead,” said Ayotte, a Republican, “we will ensure Granite Staters can continue to access child care scholarships, remove unnecessary barriers to entry for new providers, and partner with our community colleges, the private sector, and nonprofits like the Boys and Girls Club to expand child care options for our families and advance career opportunities in the child care workforce.”
Scholarship program
It costs the average family over $30,000 a year to put an infant and toddler in a child care center in New Hampshire, according to 2024 data from Child Care Aware of America.
In the last budget, lawmakers expanded eligibility for the state’s child care scholarship program to families making up to 85% of the state median income. Those in the program pay a cost-share for child care ranging from $0 to 7% of the family’s income. (For child care to be considered “affordable” by the federal government, it must take up no more than 7% of a family’s income.)
Some families who didn’t meet the income threshold last year may be newly eligible due to adjustments to the state median income this July. A family of four earning up to $124,595 and a family of three earning $104,660 may now be eligible for the scholarship, said Nicole Heller, senior policy analyst at the New Hampshire Fiscal Policy Institute, a nonpartisan research nonprofit. 
In this state budget, lawmakers focused on cutting down paperwork burdens that may have dissuaded eligible families from accessing assistance and providers from participating in the program. 
Trina Ingelfinger, the early care and education policy coordinator at New Futures, a health policy advocacy group, said her organization had heard “from both providers and families over the last year or so that overly burdensome paperwork requirements were making it difficult to access the program, and as a result, this was interfering with families’ path back to work, and we also understood that some child care providers were opting out of the program because of these issues.”
The budget establishes a two-year pilot program, starting in January 2026, that will give families who have undergone an initial screening access to the scholarship while they complete the application process. This period may be 60 days; until a final eligibility determination is made; or when a timeframe to submit necessary information and documents, determined by DHHS, has expired — whatever comes first. 
Neither child care providers nor families will be on the hook for paying back scholarship funds should it ultimately be determined a child is ineligible for the program, “except in cases of fraud or intentional violation of program rules,” the law says.
The budget also aims to reduce burdens on providers by eliminating the requirement to report hourly attendance for scholarship recipients, “to the extent that such reporting is not necessary for administrating child care scholarship payments.”
The department will write a detailed report about the results of the pilot program for agency oversight committees in the Legislature by May 1, 2028. 
The law also requires the department to, by December, implement a system that will allow providers to receive scholarship payments “in advance of or at the beginning of each payment period.”
The budget appropriates $100,000 to the department to implement these directives. It also allows the state to tap into additional Temporary Assistance for Needy Families reserve funds if they’re needed to prevent a waitlist from forming.
Sen. Denise Ricciardi, a Bedford Republican, said in a statement to the Bulletin that the law “simply makes it easier for eligible families to participate in the scholarship program and return to work.”
“Because of the safeguards in the bill, like a family screening process, the program is not expected to expand eligibility or create any new costs for the state once it is up and running,” Ricciardi said.
Historically, many families who are eligible for the program have not participated in it, but increased enrollment numbers have followed expanded eligibility. Heller pointed to April data from the state that showed the number of children using scholarships has jumped 66% since the expanded eligibility went into effect in January 2024, adding another 1,700 children to the program. 
Workforce grant uncertain, tax relief quashed
The budget directs DHHS to ask the federal government for permission to use TANF reserve funds “for the purpose of financing recruitment and retention bonus and benefit grants for New Hampshire child care employees.”
It’s not yet clear whether the federal government will approve the use of the money. 
The child care workforce in the state faces massive stressors, with high turnover and low wages. With cost-of-living adjustments, New Hampshire’s child care workers “have the second-lowest wages in the country,” according to a primer from the University of New Hampshire’s Carsey School of Public Policy. (The Couch Family Foundation, which funds the New Hampshire Bulletin’s early care and education reporting position, provided support for this research.)
To put the intersecting challenges of the sector into perspective, the researchers found that “if a child care worker were to purchase center-based care for their own infant and four-year old, this expense would utilize 98.6 percent of the average New Hampshire child care worker salary.”
One possible method for cutting down costs for providers was ultimately quashed this year. Senate Bill 275, led by Dover Democratic Sen. David Watters, sought to provide property tax relief for some child care agencies, as well as allowing school building aid to be used for some pre-kindergarten programs. 
The Senate voted, 16-8, along party lines, to shoot down the legislation. Sen. Timothy Lang, a Sanbornton Republican, argued the bill was too broad and would deplete limited school building aid resources.
Watters said it became apparent, once the session was rolling, that there would be “real resistance” from his Republican colleagues on the issue. But looking ahead to the future, he said the chamber has historically been able to get “some very good things done in a very strong, unanimous, bipartisan fashion.”
“The governor campaigned on this. We all did, Republicans and Democrats,” Watters said. “We all campaigned on … housing and on child care and on energy and, you know, some other things. But you know, I mean, the very top priorities are for housing and child care.”
Looking ahead
State investments are needed to make significant changes to the child care landscape in New Hampshire, some of those involved in the issue said.
Shannon Tremblay, director of the New Hampshire Child Care Advisory Council, enacted by the Legislature in 1995, emphasized a need for the state to find revenue sources to invest in child care. She said that should include revisiting the recently eliminated interest and dividends tax, which generated tens of millions of dollars for the state each year.
“We’re rich. I mean, we’re one of the most wealthiest states, but we don’t invest that money,” Tremblay said. “And if you say the word taxes, you know, people tend to cringe, but I think that’s what it’s really going to take.”
MacKenzie Nicholson, New Hampshire’s senior director of the advocacy group MomsRising, said she wants to “see a system that actually invests in child care.” Small policy fixes that act as “little Band-Aids aren’t doing enough to cover the gaping wound that is our child care crisis right now,” she said.
“The reason that we didn’t really lose child care dollars in the budget process this year is because there is none to cut. As a state, we don’t invest in child care,” Nicholson said. “The money that comes in comes from the federal government, and so there’s no way to offset the costs for families or for providers, who ultimately are the workforce behind the workforce.”
On the issue of child care, Sen. Rebecca Perkins Kwoka, a Portsmouth Democrat and the Senate’s minority leader, said “we just continue to not do enough.” That could have serious consequences for the state, she said.
“This is a huge issue, you know, for people that want to come and build a family and live and work in New Hampshire,” Perkins Kwoka said. “The availability of child care and housing is just fundamental to them being able to move and build their lives here, and if we don’t accommodate it, they’re going to find and build their lives somewhere else.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/tararyanchamberofmoms-1024x711.jpeg,,,2025-08-11 05:56:32.412755

This story was originally reported by Shefali Luthra and Barbara Rodriguez of The 19th. Meet Shefali and Barbara and read more of their reporting on gender, politics, and policy.
When there’s a maternal health emergency, Jessica Wheat springs into action.
Alongside a group of specialized health providers at Research Medical Center in Kansas City, Wheat works fast to make sure patients are able to have their babies delivered safely or their children given critical treatment at the Level III neonatal intensive care unit on site.
“We have just an abundance of resources, and people that know what they’re doing,” the labor and delivery nurse said.
That abundance is coming to an end. Last month, HCA Midwest Health, which owns Research Medical Center, announced it was closing its obstetrics program and NICU. The umbrella company that runs HCA Midwest Health, which oversees multiple hospitals and related sites of care in nearly two dozen states, cited declining births at the hospital as part of its reasons for the closure.
Wheat is worried about the implications for local patients who often struggle to find transportation even across Kansas City. But she’s also concerned about the rural patients outside of the metro area.
“We tend to get smaller hospitals that will Life Flight bleeding moms or moms who are breech or moms who are having a hypertensive crisis,” she said. “We can do the emergency C-section — a lot of smaller hospitals do not have those capabilities. The farther they have to go, the more at risk they’re going to be for complications, even death.”
The availability of obstetrics care in America has been dwindling for years. That could accelerate now, as hospital leaders across the country warn that President Donald Trump’s massive cuts to Medicaid, the federal-state health insurance program for low-income Americans, could leave pregnant people in rural communities with vanishingly few options for medical care.
Obstetrics is one of the most expensive services provided by hospitals, especially in rural areas, which often see a larger portion of Medicaid patients. Nationwide, the program pays for about 40 percent of all births. With financial hits looming, hospitals are primed to close maternity wards first, and rural areas are particularly vulnerable.
“This is going to have an enormous impact,” said Dr. John Cullen, a family physician in Valdez, Alaska, a remote city of about 4,000 people. “Already we’re seeing OB deserts that are increasing in size, and after the passage of this bill those are going to be markedly worse — where people are going to have to drive hundreds of miles before they can get prenatal care, much less delivery.”
For years, hospitals facing financial pressure have shuttered maternity wards. Between 2010 and 2022, more than 500 hospitals across the country dropped obstetrics, per a recent study that also shows more than half of rural counties now have no hospital-based obstetric services. A report from the advocacy group March of Dimes found that 1 in 3 U.S. counties had no OBGYN at all.
There are numerous reasons for the recent closures, ranging from declining births to difficulties hiring local providers. But the biggest issue is financial: Hospitals typically don’t earn enough from labor and delivery to cover the cost. Now, cuts to Medicaid — which will further cut hospital revenues and increase their share of uncompensated care — threaten to strain finances further.
“I do have a lot of concern that we’ll continue to see labor and delivery units close in rural hospitals and potentially even at an accelerated rate, as hospitals feel greater strain due to cuts in the bill,” said Carrie Cochran-McClain, chief policy officer with the National Rural Health Association.
The National Rural Health Association and Manatt Health, a consulting firm, estimated in June that the proposed Medicaid cuts over 10 years could reach almost $70 billion just for rural hospitals. Nearly half of all children and 1 in 5 adults in rural communities are enrolled in Medicaid or the related Children’s Health Insurance Program. The health insurance plan also pays hospitals less for the same services than private insurance does.
“When rural hospitals say, ‘We have these big Medicaid cuts, how do we deal with that shortfall?’ the OB units are going to be first on the chopping block,” said Jamie Daw, an associate professor of health policy at Columbia University.
One analysis from the National Partnership for Women and Families, a nonpartisan organization that supports policies such as equal pay and access to health care, suggests that the new cuts to Medicaid put almost 150 rural hospitals with maternity services at risk of serious downsizing or closing altogether.
The changes to Medicaid — including cumbersome new paperwork requirements for people insured through the program, and cuts to some of the taxes used to finance state Medicaid programs — largely won’t take effect until after the 2026 midterm elections. But already, hospitals are preparing for huge reductions in services, and pointing to labor and delivery as one of their most vulnerable offerings.
Michigan-based Trinity Health operates five hospitals that include maternity services. Hospital leaders are deeply concerned about service cuts that would make it harder for pregnant patients to get appropriate medical care, said Dr. Sharon O’Leary, an OBGYN and the organization’s chief data analytics and chief equity officer.
When patients have to travel further for prenatal care, they are more likely to cut the number of doctors’ visits or to receive no prenatal care at all. Studies over the past several years have shown that obstetrics unit closures — and increased travel time for pregnant patients — result in higher rates of pregnancy-related complications, including premature birth and low birth weight.
“Our biggest fear is that as women lose coverage that they will not seek prenatal care,” O’Leary said.
The consequences are likely to be heightened in areas that are already underserved, and where birth outcomes are worse: rural parts of the country, and, in particular, large swaths of the South.
“While we are concerned about the impact the bill will have on all hospital services, we are particularly concerned about its impact on labor and delivery services,” said Richard Roberson, president and CEO of the Mississippi Hospital Association.
Already, rural areas have seen access to reproductive care dwindling, particularly in the past three years, since the fall of Roe v. Wade allowed states to outlaw abortion. Preliminary data shows that medical residents for OBGYN are applying in smaller numbers to states with abortion bans and a recent study in the medical journal JAMA, the first to assess the relationship between abortion bans and provider availability, found that in Idaho, the number of OBGYNs fell by 35 percent between August 2022 — when the state implemented its near-total ban — and December 2024.
Abortion ban states, which are largely in the South, also have higher rural populations, worse birth outcomes, and larger shares of hospitals at risk of closure.
“It’s an additional trend — on top of this piece of the general financial pressure  — that’s going to also affect predominantly rural Southern communities,” Daw said. “It seems like a perfect storm of these concurrent trends really really affecting access to care.”
If hospitals reduce their pregnancy-related offerings, few alternatives will be able to fill in the gap. Earlier this year, the Trump administration began withholding millions of dollars in family planning grants through Title X, the federal program that supports family planning services for low-income people. Planned Parenthood, a major provider of services that include cancer screenings, testing for sexually transmitted diseases, and contraception, is also one of the largest Title X providers. Most Planned Parenthood clinics are in rural or otherwise medically underserved areas. The federal budget and tax law also includes a provision that would cut federal Medicaid funding from Planned Parenthood, though that policy has since been blocked by a federal court ruling. In recent weeks, several clinics have announced their plans to close.
“You have to think of them as related,” Daw said. “It’s definitely not helpful to have all of these changes happening at the same time and really undermining the safety net for reproductive-aged women.”
Cochran-McClain said when a provider with a background in obstetrics care leaves a rural town or city, that impacts health services more broadly: Often, that provider was also providing contraception, general gynecological care and routine screenings.
“It’s so interconnected. While we’re talking specifically about labor, delivery, and pregnancy, it can have an impact more broadly on access to women’s health in rural communities,” she said. “It’s been a rough couple of years before all of this, so it just feels like it’s a worsening trend in terms of overall access.”
The closure at Research Medical Center in Kansas City — where its obstetrics program is scheduled to close down in early September — also shows that even when a person in a rural area is forced to travel greater distances into a city setting for specialized care, those services aren’t guaranteed.
Wheat and other affected nurses at Research Medical Center, where they are represented by National Nurses United, said HCA Midwest Health has not provided enough information about the logistics of winding down services. Will the rest of the hospital, including its ICU unit, take emergency patients who need labor and delivery services? Or will the remaining staff in other areas of the hospital get specialized training?
HCA Midwest Health, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The 19th, said in a statement to a media outlet that it is working with area health providers to ensure patients have other delivery options.
Wheat has lined up another nursing job in labor and delivery with a different hospital system. In her text group chats with other impacted staff, there is a sense of sadness. She believes the obstetrics-related health providers will find other work, even if it means even more gas mileage to get to a new job. But Wheat keeps thinking about what’s to come for the patients.
“I’m emotionally exhausted. It is hard,” she said. “We’re just grieving for the community at this point, because we know they’re going to have a lot of issues after we’re gone.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/pregnancyrural-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-08-11 04:56:17.480358

State Reps. Tristan Rader, D-Lakewood, and Christine Cockley, D-Columbus, recently introduced Ohio House Bill 399. 
The bill would prohibit the director of the Ohio Department of Natural Resources from issuing a permit that would remove oil or natural gas from under a state park or Lake Erie. 
“Protecting our environment is just a critically important thing,” Rader said. “I think protecting our public lands, conserving the space we’ve already decided should be conserved, is actually a pretty salient idea.”
“Who’s gonna want to move here?” How fracking around Ohio’s Salt Fork State Park is changing area

Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine signed a bill into law in 2023 that allowed fracking for natural gas in Ohio’s public lands and state parks. Since then, fracking has begun in Salt Fork State Park, the state’s largest state park. 
“I think the natural progression of where we’re headed next is drilling in state parks,” Rader said. “So my goal is to try to stop that at all costs. Let’s actually do what we set out to do, and preserve these lands, instead of extracting from them, farming them, destroying these habitats.”
There have been approximately 2,000 incidents associated with oil and gas wells in Ohio over the past eight years, according to FracTracker Alliance — a nonprofit that collects data on fracking pipelines. 
Ohio has 76 state parks that are managed by ODNR. 
“Our state park network is just so phenomenal,” Rader said. “We own a lot of lands as a state that’s conserved for various reasons.”
Lake Erie 
Federal law prohibits drilling in the Great Lakes and Rader said he thinks it’s important to “have some state protections to layer on top of some of these federal protections.” 
“I think redundancy, right now, when it comes to federal law is incredibly important, especially when you see an administration that is absolutely gung ho and drilling in all places, and doesn’t seem to really respect federal law very directly, and is willing to either go to court or ignore courts,” Rader said. 
Ohio Oil and Gas Association President Rob Brundrett said he is unaware of interest in drilling under Lake Erie. 
“We have not seen much interest from our members over the years to explore Lake Erie,” he said. “However, we do believe there could be a potential benefit in the exploration and production from the Great Lakes.”
Drilling in Lake Erie could pose risks to the drinking water and wildlife, including millions of walleye, Rader said.  
“Oil wells, oil drilling, (and) oil pipelines have a high risk of adding all kinds of toxins, whether it’s from the brines they use or spills that happen all too often,” he said. “I want to try my best as a human being to leave this planet better than where I found it, and part of that is keeping our lakes and streams and green spaces free of pollution.”
Environmentalists fear Lake Erie fracking, oil and gas industry says not to worry

This is not the first time a bill like this has been introduced. Former Democratic state Rep. Mike Skindell introduced a similar bill in 2023 during the last General Assembly that would have prevented fracking under Lake Erie, but the bill only received sponsor testimony. 
Rader is hopeful his bill will get a couple of hearings and maybe a vote, but as a Democratic bill in a Republican-controlled Statehouse, the cards are stacked against H.B. 399.
“Of course it’s Ohio, I’m not holding my breath,” Rader said. “But without putting the idea forward, without having the bill in, you don’t have that chance. So that’s what we’re doing.”
Protecting the planet should be a partisan issue, Rader said. 
“I think there are some folks on both sides of the aisle that think this is actually pretty important,” he said. “I think conservation is a concept that’s pretty core to conservatism, actually, as well as liberalism. It’s something that I do think we’ll get some buy in.”

(Photo by Graham Stokes for the Ohio Capital Journal / Republish photo only with original story)Ohio U.S. Sen. Bernie Moreno has joined President Donald Trump in asking for tech giant Intel’s CEO to resign due to his reported ties to the Chinese government.
Moreno has also asked for a fraud investigation into Intel’s continued delays on the state’s long-awaited semiconductor manufacturing plant.
Ohio’s multi-billion-dollar semiconductor manufacturing plant has faced delay after delay after delay, and was supposed to be operational by now.
“It was an unrealistic expectation that they would be producing chips in the summer of 2025,” Dorsey Hager with the Columbus/Central Ohio Building Trades Council said last Thursday.
That’s thousands of construction jobs stalled, ones that Hager said Intel promised when they broke ground at the central Ohio construction site in 2022.
“They talked about ramping up to close to 8,000 construction workers at the peak,” Dorsey said. “We have close to 1,200 people out there right now.”
That’s also hundreds of millions of Ohio taxpayer dollars that state Sen. Bill DeMora, D-Columbus, says are being unused by Intel.
“We’re never getting the jobs we were promised, we’re never getting the economic development we were promised,” DeMora said. “All that’s happened is we spent a lot of state money on infrastructure, drove up property rates for all the people that live there, and now we’ve got a boondoggle.”
After years of the company’s stock plummeting, plus repeated layoffs, the company moved its expected completion date from 2025 to the 2030s.
Still, Lt. Gov. Jim Tressel said he believes Intel will stay true to its original promise of the multi-billion-dollar investment.
“Nothing’s easy, especially in a changing industry like the one they’re in, but they’ve already made a lot of investment and they’re still working on it,” Tressel said Thursday.
Asked about Ohio taxpayer money being spent on something that doesn’t exist yet, Tressel said that’s fair and frustrating for sure.
“We have contractual things that have to be met, I don’t think those are for a couple more years, but I understand the frustration,” he responded. “Big things are hard; sometimes the progress doesn’t happen like you’d like it to.”
Another issue is causing concern among other Republicans.
Both U.S. Sens. Jon Husted and Moreno have raised concerns about the new Intel CEO, Lip-Bu Tan. This year, Tan invested hundreds of millions in Chinese companies that have ties to their government, according to a report by Reuters.
President Donald Trump and Moreno have asked for Tan to resign, and Moreno said that the project needs to be completed, “and a fraud investigation should be initiated.”



Husted, who has been the face of Intel in Ohio since he helped bring it to the state when he was lieutenant governor, took a softer approach.



“Obviously, if someone’s a part of the CCP, it’s a problem in my mind, but I think you have to be fair until facts come out,” Tressel said.
Gov. Mike DeWine, to reporters in Dayton, echoed his second-in-command’s thoughts.
“We are always very careful who the state deals with. Anybody who is associated with the Communist Party in China — that’s a problem. We don’t trust them, we don’t like them, they’re not good,” DeWine said. “I think we have to wait, though, in this case to see what the facts are.”
DeWine referenced how “we” have not heard from Intel about this matter, he said.
“I’m sure that Intel does not, would not want to be associated with someone, and we wouldn’t want them associated with someone who would be close to the Communist Party in China, but we don’t know that for a fact at this point, so I’m going to reserve judgment on that,” he said.
We reached out to Intel, but it didn’t respond directly to us. The company released the following statement to the public later in the day:

“Intel, the Board of Directors, and Lip-Bu Tan are deeply committed to advancing U.S. national and economic security interests and are making significant investments aligned with the President’s America First agenda. Intel has been manufacturing in America for 56 years. We are continuing to invest billions of dollars in domestic semiconductor R&D and manufacturing, including our new fab in Arizona that will run the most advanced manufacturing process technology in the country, and are the only company investing in leading logic process node development in the U.S. We look forward to our continued engagement with the Administration.”

However, its spokesperson has told us for years that their commitment to Ohio remains strong. Hager is keeping with that optimism, but DeMora doesn’t believe it’s happening.
“Intel is dead,” he said. “We’re never going to see Intel.”
DeWine said the state won’t be able to claw back money from the state’s investment in the Intel project until at least 2029.
“On January 1, 2029 is the time when we look back and we see ‘did they produce the jobs when they said they were going to do or not,’ but up until then, the contract does not provide any remedy for the state,” the governor said Thursday. “I remain confident that Intel is going to be making chips in Ohio.”

Arroyo revealed city police investigated her citizenship status and required her to prove her citizenship. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)There’s a word for what happened to Lenexa City Council member Melanie Arroyo, and it begins with an “r” and ends with “ism.”
Go ahead. Take a wild guess.
Arroyo was forced to prove her citizenship to city police after someone left a voicemail with the Kansas Bureau of Investigation. We subsequently learned that the KBI deleted the message after informing local law enforcement of its contents. That could well conflict with document retention rules, but let’s save that for later. Instead, let’s scrutinize what the statewide crime-fighting agency told Lenexa police via email.
Their words suggest that Kansas has a long way to go in treating residents respectfully and equally.
According to a KBI agent, a man “called with a question regarding the citizenship of a member of the Lenexa City Council. He stated that in February of 2025 Melanie Arroyo (possibly Melanie Arroyo-Lopez), a representative for Ward 3, gave testimony wanting to give illegals more benefits. During this testimony she acknowledged that she came to this country illegally as a child, but never acknowledged naturalization. He stated that this testimony was posted to the internet. He stated that to be a qualified elector, they had to be registered to vote and be born here or naturalized. He wanted to report this information for investigation.”
Big problems come to mind immediately. Namely that the KBI has passed along a bunch of patently false information.
Not a good look for the agency we depend on to keep Kansans safe.
First off, Arroyo’s full last name is Arroyo Pérez, not Arroyo-Lopez. Those two names actually sound quite different!
Secondly, “gave testimony wanting to give illegals more benefits” patently misstates Arroyo’s testimony. She argued for the continuation of current Kansas policy, not extending or expanding any policy.
Third, the email states that Arroyo “came to this country illegally as a child” based on her legislative testimony. That’s also untrue. She writes that she grew up as an undocumented migrant, but that doesn’t mean she or her family entered the United States illegally. Indeed, in a Kansas City Star op-ed published March 6, Arroyo notes that she came here legally but overstayed a visa.
Finally, the email claims that she “never acknowledged naturalization.” Actually, both the testimony and column state that her undocumented status had been “resolved.”
To summarize, the information that the KBI forwarded to the Lenexa Police Department contains four factual errors. These aren’t the kind of mistakes that take time or effort to uncover, either. You literally just have to read Arroyo’s actual words, as submitted to lawmakers and as published in the region’s newspaper of record.
Did no one at the KBI do this?
Did no one on the Lenexa police force do this?
If not, why?
Taken as a whole, I see clear signs of racism. You can see it in the confusion of last names. You can see it in the use of the word “illegals.” You can see it in the automatic assumption that anyone who looks a certain way, sounds a certain way, comes from a particular background, necessitates scrutiny. As I wrote last week, there’s just as much reason to ask Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach about his citizenship status. (That is, none.)
State and local law enforcement also failed to think critically. Ponder this: Would a Lenexa resident of distinction — a city council member, no less — give public testimony about benefits for undocumented Kansans and not have her own papers in order? Officers were asked to believe Arroyo was somehow willing to risk prison time, removal from office and deportation just so she could voice her opinion on a proposed bill.


That doesn’t pass the smell test. It’s bias, plain as day.


The KBI and the Lenexa police force probably didn’t set out with a explicit intention of harming Arroyo. Yet they did not give her the benefit of the doubt, either. They did not consider publicly available sources. They did not treat the recorded words from a “Johnson County man” with the appropriate amount of skepticism or critical thought. They decided that shaming a public official made more sense than questioning their own motives.
Take it from your friendly neighborhood journalist. Public officials in Kansas need to do a better job of checking their sources.

Mike DeWine’s veto of a line in the state budget that would ban certain types of levies from being put on the ballot by local governments or school districts.
The reason House members thought this was so important that they needed to get together and have this vote even when their chamber was closed for renovation was because they saw this as a way to reduce the burden of property taxes.
In the wake of COVID-19, global supply chain disruption, a contraction of building materials, and changes in demographics caused substantial shifts in housing supply. 
Many in Ohio have seen the value of their home increase precipitously in the years since 2020, especially in 2022-2024. 
With three-year valuations coming in, many were hit with sticker shock of their new property taxes, and state lawmakers leapt into their fighting stances, ready to find a way to reduce the impact of property taxes on households.
The Ohio General Assembly commissioned a committee to study ways to reduce the burden of property taxes. This led to a series of provisions in the new state budget trying to reduce the burden of property taxes in the state.
The provision that was vetoed and the focus of the Ohio House override is focused on a specific type of levy: an emergency or replacement levy. 
This is still a levy that has to go before voters, the same way any other property tax levy does. 
The argument made by House members on the floor was that by banning the use of the phrase “emergency” or “replacement,” voters would not be “tricked” into voting for property taxes they didn’t believe in.
So basically, the diagnosis here is that property taxes are so burdensome, at least partially, because people mistakenly vote for them.
Ultimately, these sorts of policy changes to the property tax system will do little to reduce the burden of property taxes. 
Yes, legislators can now go to their constituents and say “Hey, I went out there and voted even as the House chamber was under renovation to deliver property tax relief to you.” 
But these are small administrative changes to the types of property taxes that are being put before voters. They will do little to reduce the burden of property taxes.
It is worth asking the bigger question: are property taxes really the problem residents of Ohio are struggling with? 
Or is the real problem that property taxes grew in a short period of time relative to incomes? 
Because that is unlikely to happen again soon with interest rates high and the global supply chain for building materials at a new equilibrium. 
There is good reason to believe that legislators are stuck fighting the last war around property taxes.
So what can policymakers do? 
They can improve upon the system by moving from a property tax to a land value tax, which falls less heavily on low-income renters and does not penalize people for developing their land. 
They can invest in programs like early childhood and K-12 education which improve incomes in the long-run or the earned income tax credit and child tax credit which would improve incomes in the short-run.
Or they can keep beating around the bush, making small changes to the property tax system that do little more than to complicate an already-complicated system.

When Siri Fiske founded the Mysa Microschool in Washington, D.C., in 2016, there wasn’t a widely accepted term for her small, one-room schoolhouse model.
Now, the school is referred to on its website as one of the first microschools in the nation, and Fiske has seen a growing microschool movement since the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the five years since remote schooling amid pandemic-era lockdowns, microschools and homeschooling have emerged as increasingly popular alternatives to traditional public and private models. Smaller class sizes, individualized classrooms and lack of standardization are an appeal to parents, Fiske said.
“There’s this idea that people who open microschools are doing it for cultish or religious reasons, and there’s a misconception that all are like that,” Fiske said. “I’ve seen my students graduate into top colleges. There’s many ways to achieve academic success.”
Some education experts, however, have expressed concern about the growing movement. They question whether microschools are properly regulated and being held accountable, and whether they’ll pull dollars out of the public education system.
There is no federal definition of a microschool, and with the Trump administration’s plans to shutter the U.S. Department of Education, the onus is on states to figure them out.
In some states, microschools face a bind: If they operate as private schools, they’re required to meet facility, staffing and curricular standards that are often cost-prohibitive for schools their size. If they operate under homeschool laws, they face oversight, assessment mandates and reporting requirements that aren’t designed for multifamily or educator-led models.
Some states, including Georgia, Tennessee and Texas, have passed “Learning Rights Protection Acts” to codify microschools’ right to operate.
In Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts and Oregon, learning pods and microschools often face child care or private school licensing requirements if they involve multiple families, hire instructors or provide compensation for child care.
“Schools calling themselves microschools today are not what I would’ve called one back then. But I think that’s OK. It’s evolving,” Fiske said.
She pointed to the national school choice movement — and states such as West Virginia — for helping the microschool movement flourish.
In 2022, West Virginia became one of the few states to define a microschool, distinctly separating it from a private school, homeschool or learning pod.
Those classifications, and how these schools are funded and regulated, affect everything from whether a school must hire certified teachers to how it ensures student safety or civil rights protections. And with more public dollars flowing to private or hybrid learning options through vouchers and education savings accounts — to the detriment of public school funding, some argue — states will need to define these schools and their place in the ecosystem.
States will have to fill the gaps, said Weadé James, senior director of K-12 education policy with the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning policy think tank.
“Accountability can vary wildly. Some microschools aren’t required to have certified teachers, conduct annual assessments, or even guarantee civil rights protections,” said James. “If public voucher dollars are going to a microschool, there has to be some level of oversight and accountability.”
 Many microschools aren’t accredited

Microschools defy easy classification, and many advocates argue that’s by design. Don Soifer, CEO of the National Microschooling Center, an industry group, cautions lawmakers against rushing to impose fixed legal definitions.
“Innovation is happening too fast. The moment you define it in law, it becomes obsolete,” Soifer said.
A 2024 sector analysis by the National Microschooling Center — one of the only sources of national data on the topic — found that many schools are operating outside traditional education principles.
In a survey of 400 microschools across 41 states, more than 60% of founders reported they were not currently licensed educators. Eighty-four percent reported their schools were not accredited. Among prospective founders, 48% are licensed educators (though only 14% currently work in public schools), 32% come from non-education fields, and 23% are parents building schools for their own children.
Most microschools (55%) operate under homeschool laws, while others function as private schools (37%), charters (6%) or fall into unique state categories (3%), according to the analysis.
“So, you can be a private or homeschool microschool program, where you aren’t required to provide students with certified teachers, or you aren’t required to conduct annual assessments,” James said.
Often described as “homeschool hybrids” or “small-scale learning communities,” microschools often serve around 16 students or fewer, and tend to cater to families with average or above-average incomes in their area. In some states, microschools have been authorized to receive public funds through voucher programs.
Some critics note that, like private schools, microschools may charge tuition, potentially excluding lower-income families and contributing to educational disparities.
These schools often operate in commercial spaces (41%), private residences (28%) or houses of worship (25%), according to the National Microschooling Center. The center also found the movement is diversifying: 37% of prospective founders are people of color, compared with 27% of current operators.
Because building and zoning codes vary from state to state and locality to locality, many operators may be unaware of the extra costs to meet school codes standards. Fiske recalls difficulties in expanding from Washington, D.C., to Vermont, which has stricter laws on water fountain requirements.
“Most people in the U.S. starting a microschool are doing it under the radar because the regulations to open a licensed school are so intense,” Fiske said. For the new school, she recalled, “it took us forever, and we had to install ADA-compliant toilets and water fountains for just 10 kids in Vermont.”
 ‘Microschooling is not one thing’

Microschools also operate in a legal gray zone, often outside the traditional K-12 system and subject to a patchwork of state and local policies that can either support or constrain their growth.
Growth has accelerated in conservative-leaning states with robust school choice programs, such as Arizona and Florida. Other states, such as Maryland, New York and North Dakota, have more restrictive homeschool or private school laws.
“Microschooling is not one thing. These schools look different in every state, and the policy frameworks around them vary wildly,” said Soifer, of the National Microschooling Center.
What is classified as a microschool can vary from “10 kids in a basement in Kentucky” to a 200-kid schoolhouse elsewhere.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Fiske said states need to create a way for operators and parents to know what to expect in a certain state, and help willing operators get the education and business acumen they need to run the schools successfully.
“But if you look at who is starting microschools in the U.S., it’s a lot of millennial parents who may not have any teacher training but wanted to create a learning environment for their children and others in the local community,” said Fiske. “And without efforts by the state to provide some incentives to earn accreditation and information as both a school and a small business, a few of these will find themselves going under.”
 Seeking choices

After two decades working in conventional schools in the United States and around the world — including in Brazil, Egypt and Qatar — Justine Wilson turned down a high-paying leadership role at a prestigious private school. Instead, in 2023 she opened Curious and Kind Education, a two-day-a-week microschool in Sarasota, Florida, built around trust, nature-based learning and self-directed play.
Enrollment at Curious and Kind is mostly driven by word of mouth, she said. The program now has a waitlist. And Wilson has seen her enrollment grow from 18 students in her first year to roughly 100 students for the upcoming school year.
“The number of 5-year-olds on my waitlist is shocking,” she said, “and then I realized they’re COVID babies and their parents have really been driving this search for alternative schooling since the pandemic.”
James, of the Center for American Progress, questions whether microschools generally match the quality of traditional public schools, which still educate more than 80% of schoolchildren. She says families may be under the assumption that school choice options equate to better quality.
“We have created an illusion of choice to be quality, and I think a lot of families are seeking various choice options because they associate that with quality. But that doesn’t necessarily mean that where those students are going is any better than where they left,” she said.
“We need to take a closer look at what we are presenting to families,” James said. “It’s not just about having options and having a choice. It’s about having quality choice options.”
That quality, Soifer said, is what microschools are trying to achieve.
“Microschools do very well on the left, on the right … at the top end of the economy and at the fragile end of the income spectrum,” he said. “It’s really a matter of the new economy and a new way of thinking about education.”

Those go to U.S. Rep. Mike Flood, R-Neb., who faced a hostile crowd at an in-person town hall meeting last week in Lincoln. 
From my seat in the back of beautiful Kimball Hall on the University of Nebraska-Lincoln’s City Campus, the gathering did not disappoint. Nor — without mentioning names but their initials are Adrian Smith, Don Bacon and Deb Fischer — would Flood’s experience do anything but dissuade other Nebraska electeds to take the hot seat. To wit: The guy deserves an attaboy.

Before we get carried away, however, whatever information exchange he or the throng hoped for never materialized. Such is the nature of the modern political in-person town hall. Some peg the beginning of these boisterous beasts to 2009, when conspiracy theorists started showing up at town halls, shouting about President Obama’s birth certificate. The noise and the lie persisted at town halls and among true believers. Then we elected one president. Twice.
While the data dissemination at the Flood’s town hall was disappointing, clear from the outset was that he is all in with the president and MAGA — unremarkable, given Flood’s voting record. Any sense that we’d have a meeting of the minds or a parsing of policies was a long shot.
Nevertheless, several of Flood’s answers and comments were instructive as much for what they didn’t say as for what they did.
He stumbled out of the blocks when he began by suggesting that perhaps some Nebraskans may be misinformed about the Big Ugly, for which he unsurprisingly voted yes. While he cleared up the difference between Medicaid and Medicare for the three people there who didn’t understand it, his implication that the Big Ugly had nothing to do with Medicare runs contrary to the Center for Medicare Advocacy, which should know.
At least five times he said that the bill “saved Medicaid,” inexplicably equating increased funding for state hospitals and work requirements for Medicaid recipients as solving the loss of health care for 78,000 Nebraskans. 
Few in the assembly bought that calculus, their boos reaching quite a crescendo. With no number on which to hang his hat, he also contended that apparently large numbers of Medicaid recipients who could work were government cheats, lolling at home and getting free health care. 
Curious, I checked three different analyses, finding the percent of able-bodied adults on Medicaid who could work but didn’t in the 5%-8% range.
On Gaza, Flood was clear. “I stand with Israel.” Before he repeated that sentiment, he referenced the horrors Hamas visited on Israelis and that no one likes watching children suffer. Missing was what’s missing in too much of the war’s public discourse: that one can support Israel’s right to defend itself but be critical of its prosecution of the war, including the moral imperative it now faces while Palestinians dodge aerial assaults and starve to death, and be neither an anti-Semite nor a supporter of Hamas. 
Both can be true and, as the war continues unabated, the distinction grows ever more pertinent.

The town hall was held before news that the feds are considering Nebraska as a site for one of its immigrant detention camps, an incredibly bad idea. Nevertheless, Flood was enthusiastic in his support of the president’s immigration policies and completion of a wall between the U.S. and Mexico, insisting we detain and deport violent criminals and stanch the flow of fentanyl into the country. 
Great, except most data confirms that among those now detained, 65-70% have no criminal record, and less than one in ten are violent criminals. Plus, most fentanyl, 80-90%, comes across our border at legal crossing points.
One other lowlight was ironically glaring. Flood said of the president firing the Bureau of Labor Statistics director because he didn’t like the jobs report, that “there are always two sides to every story.” Really? This is the same BLS Flood and his GOP posse used during the creation of and argument for the Big Ugly.
Finally, in answering a query about why the administration is withholding medical science funds from major research universities, Flood pledged his support for such endeavors at both private and public institutions, adding that some of schools “have a poor record of anti-semitism.” To which one might ask … such as?
As in-person town halls go, Flood’s Lincoln soiree was louder and more raucous than most. The real test for those in Kimball Hall and like-minded Flood constituents in Nebraska’s 1st Congressional District, however, is to turn up at the only place louder than a town hall meeting: the ballot box.

Too many fish.
Our damn fish.
For 450 million years, the sharks have had everything their way, swimming around the ocean like they own the place, chowing down on that endless seafood buffet.
Who do those sharks think they are? Other than, like, sharks.
We celebrate George Washington and Abraham Lincoln one lousy day a year.
Sharks get a whole week.
  U.S. Sen. Rick Scott of Florida. (U.S. Senate website)
No más. Florida Republican U.S. Sen. Rick Scott means to show these arrogant top predators he means business.
Sen. Scott’s elegantly named and creatively capitalized “Supporting the Health of Aquatic systems through Research, Knowledge, and Enhanced Dialogue (or SHARKED) Act will address bad behavior in the shark community. 
No longer will the sharks be allowed to appropriate fish for their own selfish nutritional ends.
It’s a bipartisan effort: Sen. Brian Schatz, a Democrat, is Scott’s SHARKED co-sponsor, although he’s being cautious about what he says.
Schatz is from Hawaii, where certain sharks are considered sacred, what with them being people’s reincarnated ancestors.
Funnily enough, Schatz was once part of the shark-coddling caucus, all-in on legislation to protect those deep sea devils.
But he’s clearly seen the light, read the room, and smelled the Trumpy zeitgeist: It’s all about the money.
Sport fishing in Hawaii is worth hundreds of millions.
Scott also once expressed a bit of sympathy for sharks.
When he saw images of boaters “abusing a young tiger shark in Citrus County,” he wrote a tough letter to the head of NOAA demanding somebody do something.
The senator still wants somebody to do something, and, by God, the Scott-Schatz bill is going to do it.
More or less.
‘Unnatural food source’
It directs the secretary of commerce to put together a task force to figure out why elasmobranch cartilaginous fishes (as ichthyology nerds call them) gobble up the very fish sportsmen and women spend so much cash to catch.
You drop big money on a three-day charter out of Destin, spend another grand on your Yeti cooler, your Bora Bora hat, your Columbia convertible pants, your Coors, your Jack, your Pringles, your Publix subs, your peanut M&Ms, you finally get something on the line, but next thing you know, Mister Jerk Shark smells the blood in the water, swims up, and takes a big old bite of your 400 lb. blue marlin.  
OK, maybe the shark was hungry, but that’s no excuse.
The American Sportfishing Association, the American Fisheries Society, and others rightly upset about sharks’ indefensible habit of consuming their usual source of protein, complain “shark depredation is clearly detrimental to anglers and predated fish that would otherwise be released.”
They point out all that illicit predation “creates an unnatural food source for sharks.”
The sharks would argue fish are, in fact, their entirely natural food source, but if it comes to a choice between those toothy behemoths and a $230 billion industry, the sharks lose.
Enviros whine about declining shark populations, pointing lefty fingers at all-American events such as Alabama’s Deep Sea Rodeo which is all about killing the biggest shark you can find.
Bottom line: Sharks are hurting the economy.
Scott has principles.
These principles, largely devoted to profit, were amply on display in a Senate committee the other day when he waxed passionate — practically Shakespearean — about the sacredness of unfettered capitalism.
Capitalism
Fellow Republican U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley had the brass-faced gall to put forth a bill banning members of Congress from trading stocks and forcing them to divest by the beginning of their next term.
How are our elected representatives supposed to get rich if you deny them all that sweet insider information?
Scott accused Hawley of attacking Donald Trump, who, as he put it, “has gone through unbelievable hell.”
Too right: The president has been forced to suffer impertinent press questions about his pedophile pal Jeffrey Epstein, disrespectful comments on his cheating at golf, and a painful lack of gold leaf in the Cabinet room.
A lesser man would have crumbled. 
But Hawley’s real ire was directed at Florida’s senior senator. He said, pointedly, “I’m not a billionaire, unlike others on this committee.”
Stung, shocked, affronted, even, Rick Scott hit back: “I don’t know when in this country it became a negative to make money. This idea that we’re going to attack people because they make money is wrong. It’s absolutely wrong.” 
Damn straight, senator: Money isn’t everything, it’s the only thing.
When they start picking on the super-rich, everybody might as well start singing “The Internationale” and pledge allegiance to the hammer and sickle.          
Just because Rick Scott’s worth at least $500 million (probably more — some of his wealth is in his wife’s name) is no reason to be mean. 
Scott will be the first, second, and probably third to tell you he grew up in public housing and in the early 1970s enlisted in the United States Navy, serving on a ship that sailed to danger zones such as Bermuda (when it wasn’t in dry dock), selling soft drinks at a huge mark-up to his fellow sailors.
Nothing more American than price-gouging!
Unless it’s big money sport fishing.
Shark chow?
So, what are we going to do to stop those sharks from snatching our fish, robbing us of the pleasure of shooting the breeze with the guys, drinking beer on a big boat, and finally piercing some fishy cheeks with metal hooks?
As former Louisiana U.S. Rep. Garret Graves, a supporter of the bill, describes it, when the shark bites a fish on somebody’s line, it’s like “the tax collector taking more off the top.”
Spit-balling here, but how about alternative shark food sources? 
If humans can learn to eat tofu, sharks can learn to eat things that aren’t fish.
Let’s get some business buy-in. Purina makes deer chow, goat chow, rabbit chow, chicken chow, sheep chow, pig chow, and cow chow.
It even makes food for large-mouth bass: Surely it can’t be that hard to manufacture shark chow.
The feds could hire a bunch of deadbeat Medicaid recipients to buzz around on the sea with great big shakers, sprinkling the shark chow onto the water — just like you do with your home aquarium.
Woke scientist types are always telling us sharks are not mindless killers like that nasty thing in “Jaws.”
In fact, they’re smart.
So maybe we could reason with them.
Find a way to communicate: It’s possible those military dolphins can speak shark. The dolphins could inform them we’re serious about our sport fish and they’d better back off.
The problem with this plan is sharks eat dolphins.
A modest proposal
If persuasion doesn’t work, there’s always firearms.
Shoot enough of them when you catch them chomping down on somebody else’s catch, and the greedy bastards will get the message.
Or what if we could solve two problems at once: the illegal immigrant thing and the shark thing?
How about we dig two deep canals, one from the Gulf of God Bless ‘Merka heading east from Chokoloskee; one from the Mar-at-Lantic heading west from Fort Lauderdale?
The canals meet at the Big Cypress detention camp, making a saltwater moat all the way around.
Stock the moat with sharks. Pen them in with big gates. 
Once the illegals realize there are 20-foot great hammerheads and 500-pound bull sharks swimming around and around, they’ll stop demanding to speak to their lawyers.
The sharks get fed, the illegals stay in jail — at least until they get sent to Sudan or Nicaragua or wherever.
Win-win.
Sport fishing — indeed, America herself — is saved.

Andy Beshear (Kentucky Lantern photo by Liam Niemeyer)FRANKFORT, Ky. – Gov. Andy Beshear’s super PAC reported another $824,800 in contributions on Friday bringing the total it raised in the first six months of this year to $1,443,000.
The largest of the contributions by far was $225,000 from Andrew Nathan Schwartzberg, a real estate developer based in Maryland who focuses on affordable housing projects.
Beshear created his super PAC, called In This Together PAC, soon after winning re-election in 2023. Beshear is prevented by the Kentucky Constitution from seeking a third term as governor, and the super PAC is a mechanism that allows him to raise money to promote political candidates and issues in Kentucky and across the country while he considers a possible candidacy for president in 2028.
The report filed on Friday with the Internal Revenue Service shows the super PAC gave significant support in the past six months to candidates in other states. It spent $143,568 in March for direct mail supporting Susan Crawford’s successful campaign for the Wisconsin Supreme Court. Crawford was the candidate favored by Democrats in that hotly-contested race that determined control of the Wisconsin high court. Also in March, In This Together donated $25,000 to Copper State Values, a PAC that supports Democrat Katie Hobbs, the governor of Arizona.
In This Together is a hybrid super PAC that can accept contributions of unlimited amounts and accept contributions from corporations. It discloses some of its financial activity to the Federal Election Commission and the rest to the Internal Revenue Service.
Early last week, In This Together filed its report with the FEC covering the first half of this year – a disclosure reported by Kentucky Lantern and other news outlets. On Friday it filed its report covering the same period with the IRS allowing a comprehensive look at its activity over the period.
The reports combined show roughly $1,443,000 in contributions, and $558,400 in spending between Jan. 1 and June 30.
The total reflects a slight increase in the pace of contributions over last year when In This Together reported raising $2.56 million over 12 months.
The vast percentage of the money taken in by In This Together so far this year came in big contributions from a small number of people, and several of the largest donors are real estate developers.
Here is a list of its largest donors during the period as listed in the report filed Friday.

Andrew Nathan Schwartzberg, Rockville, Maryland, $225,000. Schwartzberg is president of Preservation Services LLC, a national real estate development business focusing on affordable housing. The report lists his address in Maryland. Last year he gave $250,000 to In This Together. The total of $475,000 makes him the largest donor ever to In This  Together.
Maegan Ford Nicholson, $100,000. The report lists a Dallas, Texas, address and does not list an occupation. But Nicholson is listed with a Versailles address, and identified as an executive with Diamond A Farm, in a contribution she made to Beshear’s 2023 re-election campaign.
Christopher Dischinger, Louisville, developer, LGD Inc., $50,000.

They should not get away with it.,"Connecticut’s Attorney General William Tong is suing the Trump administration for withholding funds from education, Planned Parenthood and disaster relief. He is also suing this adminstration for restricting health care to transgender youth. Whether these cases have merit remains to be seen.
But there is one group that Tong has so far given a free pass: the private equity firms who ravaged Connecticut hospitals while enriching themselves with hundreds of millions of dollars.

Joseph Bentivegna MD
First some background. Prospect Medical Holdings is a private healthcare company that purchases hospitals “with a core mission to provide quality, compassionate, and accessible healthcare.”
In actuality, their goal is to buy hospitals, suck out the equity and pay investors and company executives gargantuan sums of money.
How did this happen? In 2010, a private equity group, Leonard Green and Partners, bought a 61% stake in Prospect Medical Holdings for $363 million and assumed their $158 million debt. They then went on a rampage, buying hospitals across the country. In Connecticut, they purchased Manchester Memorial Hospital and Rockville Hospital for $105 million and Waterbury Hospital for an undisclosed amount.
These hospitals owned the land and buildings in which they were housed. But Prospect Medical Holdings sold this property along with that of other hospitals across the country for $1.4 billion to a REIT (Real Estate Investment Trust) called Medical Properties Trust (MPT). Thus, the hospitals now had a huge expense they did not have before, monthly rent. Meanwhile, Leonard Green and Partners used Prospect Medical Holdings as the conduit to receive the money for these land purchases along with the cash flow from the hospital to borrow $1.1 billion. They paid off previous debts and then the executives of these companies took obscene salaries.
The Prospect Medical Holdings CEO Sam Lee took home $128 million! Leonard Green and Partners, the majority owner of Prospect Medical Holdings, received $658 million in dividends and management fees during its ownership of the hospital chain. While there are no public disclosures on how much the executives of Leonard Green and Partners pocketed, there are two managing partners, Jonathan Sokoloff and John G. Danhakl. Sokoloff’s net worth is estimated to be $150 million (although it is probably much higher) and Danhakl is worth a cool $1.7 billion. It’s safe to say these two each put at least $100 million in their pockets.
Meanwhile, the once-thriving 102-bed Rockland Hospital that served the working-class Vernon community now only offers an emergency room, one-day surgical service and behavioral health services. And at Manchester Memorial doctors have not been paid, nurses are short-staffed and working like dogs while Prospect Medical Holdings stopped funding their pensions.
And what happened when the staff tried to receive their compensation? If you said Prospect Medical Holdings declared bankruptcy, go to the head of the class!
So now what happens to these hospitals? Either some other conglomerate buys them, or they must close. Yale attempted to do so but no agreement could be reached. Prospect Medical Holdings’ bankruptcy caused two hospitals in the Philadelphia area to close and then patients had to pay $75 to get access to their records.
And it gets worse. Waterbury Hospital owes the Town of Waterbury $29 million in back taxes. But with Prospect Medical Holdings in bankruptcy, the taxpayers will get the bill.
And to add insult to injury, the bankruptcy judge approved an incentive program for six top executives, including undisclosed salary boosts, aimed at retaining key personnel during the hospital-sale process. Thus, the same people who raped the hospitals will generate huge fees by trying to sell the hospitals they destroyed. You can’t make this up.
Tong simply cannot allow this without a fight. Leonard Green and Partners must be sued along with Sokoloff, Danhakl and Lee personally – preferably in the Waterbury Courthouse.
The problem is that any lawyer reading this article, including Tong will say, “What these guys did may have been immoral, but it is not illegal. There is no case here.”
But perhaps with some creative legal thinking, a statute can be found or least possibly interpreted to mean that private equity firms cannot destroy the health care of working class communities so that their executives can buy bigger yachts.
Tong graduated from Phillips Academy, Brown University (with honors) and the University of Chicago Law School. Even if one does not agree with his politics, he must be a sharp guy. He should be able to figure out how to make a strong case while showcasing the malfeasance of these executives and letting a jury decide. Even the threat of a jury trial and the adverse publicity these executives will receive could cause them to settle for a large sum that could be used to improve health care in these communities.
And even if Tong does not win, he will become a hero to many voters outside of the Democratic bailiwick. Even hardcore Republicans are disgusted by the behavior of these plutocrats. The destruction of community hospitals by avaricious private equity executives who game the system cannot go unchallenged.

The newly rechristened Storis, formerly the oilfield supply ship Aiviq, is the first in a series of icebreakers expected to join the Coast Guard in coming years. The Storis and subsequent ships, officials said, are critical for the United States to maintain its sovereignty and control of its borders in and near the Arctic Ocean. 
“What we’re doing here today is we’re really just preparing to build our Arctic fighting force,” said Troy Edgar, deputy undersecretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, parent agency of the Coast Guard.

U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, was one of several members of Congress who secured funding for the Coast Guard to purchase the Storis for $125 million under a special contract and operating arrangement during the Biden administration. The purchase deal passed Congress after years of lobbying and political donations by the ship’s former owners.
The Aiviq, built to support Royal Dutch Shell’s oil drilling operations in the Arctic Ocean off Alaska, was available because of a disaster that saw Shell’s drilling rig break loose from the Aiviq during a 2013 storm in the Gulf of Alaska. The rig ran aground in the Kodiak archipelago and Shell abandoned its drill plans for the Arctic. 
The Aiviq was modified after post-disaster reviews found flaws in its design, and it went on to serve under contract with the Australian government in Antarctica. Then, the U.S. government became interested in the ship to fill a gap in Arctic coverage.
The U.S. Navy has no icebreakers, which leaves the Coast Guard as the agency in charge of icebreaking operations, critical for opening frozen seas to commerce, research and military missions. The agency currently has just one heavy icebreaker, and that ship is typically assigned to help operations in Antarctica. That leaves the medium icebreaker Healy as the only U.S. icebreaker available for general-purpose missions in the Arctic. 
A 2023 analysis by the Coast Guard concluded that the service needs eight to nine polar icebreakers, including four or five heavy ships and four or five medium ones to perform its assigned missions.
“I think Singapore has more icebreaking capacity than we do,” Sullivan said. “That has left us far behind our adversaries. Russia has more than 50 operational icebreakers, many nuclear-powered, many weaponized. China, which has no Arctic territory, is building a polar fleet and is spending a lot of time off our shores, including this summer.”

As Sullivan spoke, China is operating at least five research icebreakers in international waters near Alaska.
Capt. Corey Kearns is the ship’s first commanding officer, fresh from an assignment in Japan as a liaison officer with the U.S. Navy’s Seventh Fleet.
“For the Coast Guard, the big strategic thing is to show that we can operate it, get it up north, show the flag,” Kearns said.
During his time in Japan, he became familiar with the disputes over the Senkaku Islands, whose ownership is disputed among China, Taiwan and Japan.
Ships from all three nations visit the waters around those islands.
“The ability to be present guarantees your ability to to maintain sovereignty. And that’s what we’re trying to get at here in the Arctic. We need more icebreakers to be present in our waters and be clear what is our waters,” he said.
First of many icebreakers planned for Coast Guard
In January, President Donald Trump said he would seek to acquire 40 Coast Guard icebreakers. The “Big Beautiful Bill” signed by Trump in July included almost $9 billion to build a series of heavy, medium and light ships.
Those include a series of heavy Arctic icebreakers larger than the Storis. The first of those, the Polar Sentinel, is expected to come from Bollinger Mississippi Shipbuilding in 2030, with additional ships every two years afterward.
“This is an amazing moment, because it doesn’t happen that often, but it’s going to be happening a lot more,” said acting Coast Guard Commandant Adm. Kevin E. Lunday.

The Storis is scheduled to be homeported in Juneau, where Sunday’s commissioning took place, but not for several years. For the time being, it will be homeported in Seattle, Washington. 
Sullivan, speaking at the commissioning, said he would like to see the new ships homeported in Alaska as well — it’s where the ice is, he said to applause.
The Trump-signed budget measure includes $300 million for a new Coast Guard pier and other facilities in Juneau; construction has not begun, and no site has been finalized.
Both the Storis and the under-construction heavy icebreakers are too large to fit in the Coast Guard’s Kodiak base or in any port north of the Aleutian Islands. The Storis draws 34 feet, according to specifications published in 2013. The new heavy icebreakers are expected to have a similar draft. Either figure is deeper than what’s available in northern Alaska right now.
By the book, said Cmdr. Philip Baxa, chief of the Coast Guard’s aids to navigation and ice capabilities division, it takes the Coast Guard eight to 10 years to set up a new port from the time it’s chosen.
“We want to move much faster, but there’s a lot of work that has to be done to build out the pier and the shore infrastructure,” Lunday said.
He said things like housing and child care need to be available to accommodate Coast Guard personnel.
Currently, Juneau is experiencing major shortages of both.
“I chair the Coast Guard subcommittee,” Sullivan said, “so working with the Coast Guard, working with Juneau, working with the state, we’re going to press this. We’ve already made good progress on that.”
Additional work needed aboard Storis
The Storis, too, will need work and testing before it can fully perform its duties. During a pre-commissioning cruise on Saturday for members of the media and the families of the crew, one of the ship’s variable-pitch propellers malfunctioned, helping turn a planned five-hour excursion into an eight-hour one. 
The malfunction was a minor one, but fixing it may have required turning off main power for a time, the ship’s captain said, and he didn’t want to do that while families were aboard.
The Storis has a helipad, but a Coast Guard helicopter has never landed there, tried a mid-air hoist, or refueled from the ship. Some labels throughout the ship still bear the name Aiviq, and the ship’s interior art includes photos from Louisiana bayous and New Orleans streets. In the ship’s mess hall are condiments bearing the names of southern grocery stores.

On Saturday’s cruise, employees from Edison Choest Offshore, the company that formerly owned the Storis, stood alongside uniformed Coast Guard officers on the ship’s bridge.
“He’s my coach,” said Lt. j.g. Sophia Scott of chief mate Devin Keister, who wore civilian clothes next to her. 
Since the spring, employees from Edison Choest have been operating the Storis alongside enlisted Coast Guard members and officers, a unique setup for a Coast Guard ship.
Baxa, chief of the Coast Guard’s aids to navigation and ice capabilities division, helped organize the purchase of the Storis and the sprint to get it ready.
“I’ll never forget March 4 of 2025 when Admiral Lunday, our acting Commandant of the Coast Guard, directed me and my team to prepare Storis for operations and to sail away from Pascagoula, Mississippi, where the ship had been purchased and put into storage, no later than 1 June of 2025. I’m no mathematician, but that’s less than 60 days later, and at that point, zero crew members had reported aboard,” he said.
After sailing away, the ship spent another two weeks in Seattle for additional work, then arrived in Juneau during the first week of August.
Lunday said the Coast Guard’s partnership with Edison Choest enabled the Coast Guard to put the Storis in service “much faster than we would have traditionally done.”
“The imperative,” Lunday said, “is that we build out the nation’s icebreaker fleet. When we see the potential adversaries that are moving to build their icebreakers, we’ve got to move faster as the United States, and we’re going to do that. … The original plan was not to have Storis up here for another year, but the national imperative was to move faster, and so that’s why it’s here.”
Storis has a mixed history
In 2012, while towing the circular drill rig Kulluk from the Arctic Ocean to Seattle, the Aiviq ran into a heavy storm south of Kodiak. The ship’s engines died, the tow line broke, and the Kulluk ran aground after the Aiviq’s crew was unable to re-establish the tow.
No oil spill resulted and no one was injured, but it contributed to Shell’s decision to abandon its Arctic drilling plans.
Two years later, the Coast Guard published a report on the accident, concluding that actions by the tow crew, management decisions and “design engineering deficiencies … relating to the Aiviq” contributed to the wreck.

Specifically, the report noted that vents allowed seawater to contaminate the ship’s fuel.
Since then, those vents have been modified, raised farther above the deck, and the ship went on to conduct two successful voyages to Antarctica. The ship is rated to break three feet of ice while moving at five knots, but during those trips, it was able to break between three and five feet while still moving forward, Baxa said.
After Shell discontinued its Alaska offshore drilling, Edison Choest lobbied members of Congress and urged lawmakers to purchase the Aiviq for use by the federal government.
The Coast Guard initially resisted. In a 2016 hearing of the U.S. House’s Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Subcommittee, then-Coast Guard Vice Commandant Charles Michel told lawmakers that “our current opinion is that the ship is not suitable for military service, without substantial refit.”
Then-Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska, called Michel’s statement a “bulls**t answer” because the Aiviq would be asked to move ice, not perform military duties.
In 2022, after Young’s death in office, Congress passed the Don Young Coast Guard Authorization Act, which approved funding for the Coast Guard to buy a “United States built available icebreaker.”
The Coast Guard, which had been considering a Finland-built ship, switched to the Aiviq as the only available ship that met Congress’ qualifications. 
Subsequent reporting by ProPublica showed an extensive history of political donations by Edison Choest to members of Congress, including Alaska’s delegation.
“It is ready for Coast Guard service,” Lunday said of the Aiviq-turned-Storis when asked about the July 2016 hearing that labeled the Aiviq as unfit.
“We’ve learned a lot since then, and we’ve had great support from Congress to have the appropriations necessary last year to purchase the ship,” he said.
Sullivan, among the members of Congress who received contributions from Edison Choest, denied that those donations contributed to the decision to purchase the Aiviq.
“It has nothing to do with it,” Sullivan said. “Zero. I’ve been pressing for more icebreakers any way possible for our country … and the Coast Guard was looking at the idea of a commercially available one.”
New ship carries relics of prior history
The new Storis is named after its predecessor, an icebreaker that was commissioned in 1942 and served until 2007, becoming the oldest commissioned Coast Guard cutter in the fleet at the time of its decommissioning and scrapping.
In 1957, it and several other ships sailed through the Northwest Passage, marking the first time an American ship had taken that route.
Thirty-two years after that historic voyage, the Storis assisted with the cleanup after the Exxon Valdez oil spill. Ed Sasser was a crewman on board at the time. On Saturday, he sailed aboard the new edition of his former ship.
“It’s pretty cushy compared to the old Storis,” he said, noting that both ships were and are unique vessels, not part of a larger class of ships.
If he were young again, he’d serve aboard the new ship “in a New York minute.”
“Time will tell how useful it is,” he said.

Remnants of the ship’s former life remain obvious throughout.
Belowdecks are large steel containers, intended to haul bulk dry concrete or other material to offshore oil fields. For now, they’re empty until the Coast Guard either removes them or finds a use for them. 
Other pieces of the Storis’ original purpose could be useful to its new mission. Its stern holds heavy-duty towing gear, and large firefighting cannons jut from its superstructure. 
The ship has no internal laboratory space, as does the Coast Guard’s other medium icebreaker, the Healy, but it does have deck attachments for container modules that could allow it to accommodate labs.
Already, one of those spaces was in use Sunday, holding the ship’s brand-new armory, including four .50-caliber machine guns. 
“I’ve made this joke for many, many years … it’s that if you can imagine it, and you can put it into a standard 20-foot IMO container, I can embark it on board. … we had on board a very, very senior Marine Corps officer, and he asked, ‘hey, what if I put a Marine Raider team in a box?’ I said, ‘Yes, sir, I can embark that on board.’ It really does provide that flexibility for missions,” Baxa said.
The Coast Guard’s staffing contract with Edison Choest is scheduled to run through November, and it could be extended for one year. 
Both Baxa and the ship’s captain said they’ll be recommending that extension.
Lt. Cmdr. George Greendyk, the engineer officer on board the Storis, said he hasn’t had problems with the Edison Choest civilian crew. 
“Everywhere we go, we have people that have seen something like this before, and they’ve been certainly helpful answering questions for us and guiding us as we run the engineering plant,” he said.
“Right now, our primary mission is to just focus on learning the ship, training, preparing our policy and procedures,” said Lt. D.J. Corbett, the ship’s operations officer.
Corbett said that over the next two months, the Storis will head west, to Kodiak, then through the Bering Sea and north, through the Bering Strait. The ship’s port calls are still being finalized. 
Corbett said being aboard an icebreaker means being able to see and do things that no other Coast Guard cutter experiences.
“I still remember the first time that I ever saw ice,” she said. “We were going down south. We had crossed the Antarctic Circle, and all of these massive icebergs just started flowing past us. And then we had right whales that were popping up and coming to see the ship. We had orcas. It was our last sunset. As we were heading south, it would be 24 hours of sunlight. So all of this was happening, the sun was setting, and then we saw a green flash that night. At first, we didn’t believe it. We were like, Did everyone see that? And so it was my moment of, I’m living in a National Geographic special. It was really amazing.”
The ship’s first captain looks ahead
Kearns, the ship’s first captain, is an officer who started as an enlisted man in 1996 and rose through the ranks, later earning degrees in ship design. He helped design a new class of icebreakers for the Great Lakes and served as the Coast Guard’s liaison to the U.S. Navy’s Seventh Fleet, which patrols the western Pacific.

“Normally, you start off a ship designed by (the question): What capabilities are you trying to achieve? In this case, we need Arctic presence. That was the most important thing. So we’re willing to take some risk or we’re forced into it because our shipbuilding projects are so behind,” he said. 
Critically for the ship’s future, he said, is to come up with the equivalent of the ship’s operating manual. Coast Guard officers are trained to run ships, but the Storis is unique.
“What are all the things you need to learn to do the same job on Storis? And then run all of our people through that. … I think success will be when we get all of that documentation done and then get all of our watchstanders what would be considered fully qualified,” he said.
Kearns acknowledged that there are some people who would prefer that the Storis jump quickly into law enforcement, fisheries patrols and search and rescue. He prefers a slower pace.
“We need to learn how to crawl. And that’s what we’re doing, Kearns said.
For example, the crew of the Storis hasn’t yet launched the ship’s small craft, which are stored in bays along the side of the hull, in open water.
“We’ve just started to gain proficiency in launching that in protected, calm seas. So next would be, what does it look like to launch that in open water? And then how do we need to drive the ship from the bridge to create the right conditions to safely launch that boat? And then that would help us build into, ‘Oh, this is how we would  perform Coast Guard mission sets.’”
Asked about the ship’s history, the critical 2014 report and whether he has safety concerns, he said no.
“I have no concerns. I feel totally safe on Storis,” Kearns said.
He said he’s familiar with reporting that analyzed what went wrong with the Aiviq and why it was unable to keep the Kulluk from running aground.
“It easily gets attributed to design flaws for the ship, which is a little bit misleading. In extreme weather, every ship has design flaws. There’s constraints on operations. Ships are designed to operate in certain conditions to a certain extent, and if you operate the ship past those constraints, you’re going to find out what’s going to fail first,” he said.
Some engineering changes were made after the Kulluk accident — the Aiviq’s fuel vents were raised, “which means you can take more water in the vicinity of them before it would down-flood. It’s not that it couldn’t possibly happen again, but it’s less likely.”
Kearns said the “creature comforts” aboard the ship are the most easily noticeable difference from a purpose-built Coast Guard ship. 
The Storis has heated handrails, walkways and exterior stairs, a feature intended to eliminate the need for crew to beat ice away as it forms.
“There’s a lot of automation in places that we might not use it, because we use manpower instead,” he said.
Kearns said he’s also been impressed with the ship’s multiple redundancies.
“Almost every system has backups to the backups. They really thought about this thing being in the Arctic and independent and away from logistical support. There’s different ways to make water. There’s ways to handle sewage. I actually feel very comfortable with what the capabilities are,” he said.
“I’m definitely looking forward to doing ice breaking on this thing. It’s a lot of fun to drive,” Kearns said.

(Capital-Star photo by Peter Hall)The state House convened on Sunday evening to advance a Democrat-backed bill that would fund mass transit agencies across Pennsylvania, as SEPTA and other transit agencies warn of service cuts if imminent action isn’t taken.
House Democrats had hoped to include a mass transit funding increase in this year’s state budget. But that spending plan has still not been passed, six weeks after the constitutionally imposed June 30 deadline. 
The move to advance a standalone transit funding bill is something of a pressure tactic on the part of Democratic lawmakers, who say Senate Republicans need to do their part to ensure funding reaches transit agencies, and a budget is passed, before severe service cuts become a necessity.
“We can not tolerate this going on any longer,” said House Majority Leader Matt Bradford (D-Montgomery). “The other body in this building has an obligation to forthwith show what they can do to pass an annual 12-month budget for this commonwealth.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The bill follows a proposal set forth by Gov. Josh Shapiro, which would direct an additional 1.75% of the state’s total sales tax revenue to transit agencies, in order to meet their needs across the commonwealth. It also incorporates key Republican demands, such as increased funding for roads and bridges in rural areas of the state, and accountability measures that would have transit agencies take steps to address issues like fare evasion, and propose public-private partnerships that could boost revenue.
The House plans to take it up again Monday for final passage.
However, no funding plan can be passed until Senate Republicans are willing to agree to it, and the issue itself is tied up in broader negotiations over the budget that are ongoing. House Democrats, several of whom are from the Philadelphia area, have called mass transit funding one of their highest priorities. Passing a standalone bill to address the issue would mean Republicans giving up a bargaining chip in broader budget negotiations.
What’s at stake over proposed increase in mass transit funding in Pa.? 

“This is not going to become law,” said House Minority Leader Jesse Topper (R-Bedford). Referring to broader budget talks between party leaders, he added, “If we want to do the job, it has to be in that negotiation. Passing bills just to show we can pass them out of the chamber sets us back in that initiative.”
The Senate is scheduled to return on Tuesday, but spokespeople for Majority Leader Joe Pittman (R-Indiana) and President Pro Tempore Kim Ward (R-Westmoreland) did not respond to requests for comment from the Capital-Star, including questions about whether they plan to bring the transit bill for a vote, or propose a larger plan for the state budget.
Bills coming due
Most Pennsylvanians likely won’t have noticed any impacts on their day-to-day lives because of lawmakers’ failure to pass a budget by the deadline. But that could soon change.
Last week, SEPTA announced that, unless lawmakers can secure new funding by Aug. 14, service will have to be cut by 20%. That would mean the elimination of 32 routes and fewer trips on remaining bus and train lines. If funding is not increased after that, SEPTA says it will have to make more drastic cuts, including the elimination of five rail lines, 18 additional bus routes and the implementation of a 9 p.m. curfew. An estimated 800,000 people a day use SEPTA trains and buses.

Across the commonwealth, many transit agencies, serving urban, rural and suburban areas, could soon be facing similar decisions if the budget deadlock continues. More than one million Pennsylvanians – about one in 13 – utilize mass transit services each day. 
The agencies not only provide fixed route options like bus and train service, but play a key role in the operation of the state’s Shared-Ride program. The service provides seniors and disabled people with subsidized transportation to places like doctor’s appointments and grocery stores they may be unable to reach on their own.
County government officials across the state have also warned that, if budget negotiations in Harrisburg drag on much longer, safety net programs will likely be the next to feel the strain.
Shapiro says ‘the time to act is now’ on mass transit funding as potential service cuts loom

Many county-run services, such as rape crisis centers, child support enforcement programs, behavioral health services, local health departments and more, are funded at least in part by money from the state. Without a spending plan approved by lawmakers, payments will soon be delayed, which means county governments could have to cut services or begin to triage with the funds they have available.
School districts may also be forced to make due with less until lawmakers pass a budget enabling the state to distribute money. 
 Where do things stand?
Lawmakers, however, have been tight-lipped about what progress has and hasn’t been made in negotiations between Shapiro and leaders of the House Democratic and Senate Republican caucuses.
Primarily, it’s up to the governor, the majority leaders in the two chambers, and the chairs of the House and Senate appropriations committees, to reach an agreement that can earn support from a majority of lawmakers in their caucuses.
In previous press conferences, Senate GOP leaders said their goal is to rein in spending and address the structural deficit in the commonwealth’s existing budget.
While the state’s rainy day fund has more than $7 billion, Republicans have stressed that the money is easier to spend than to save. Treasurer Stacy Garrity has said the fund could support the expenses of the state’s general fund for just over 53 days.
Ward also recently told reporters that she would be open to passing a short-term budget, allowing the state to continue funding schools and other services and allowing lawmakers more time to bridge their differences.
Shapiro, however, appeared to push back on the idea at a press conference Sunday. 
“We are past the point of short-term stopgap measures,” he said.

Democratic leaders, meanwhile, have been vocal about the need to fund mass transit before services across the commonwealth are cut, but have offered little insight into what other issues may be the source of disagreement.
“40% of this commonwealth’s revenue comes from southeastern Pennsylvania,” House Appropriations Chair Jordan Harris (D-Philadelphia), told reporters Sunday. “ If folks cannot get to work and commerce doesn’t happen in southeastern Pennsylvania, it will eventually affect the budget of the entire commonwealth.”
Harris also stressed that the Democratic-controlled House already passed a full budget, as well as four standalone transit funding bills, though the Senate has yet to take similar action.
The budget bill the House voted on last month would see the state spend less than what Shapiro proposed in his February budget address, an apparent concession to Senate Republicans, who have said they want to shrink the deficit. 
“We just passed a budget that was a billion dollars short [of Shapiro’s proposal]. What the hell else do they want us to do?,” Harris said. “They need to pass something. They need to show us something that we can get done so we can close this thing out.”
Speaking to PCN last month, Pittman said that the budget already passed by the House was not reflective of ongoing negotiations.

“What the House passed was not something that we agreed to, and that’s okay. They have their vision of how the budget should look and we have our own vision,” he said. “In divided government, we have some very philosophical differences that are deep, and those deep philosophical differences need to be reconciled somehow, some way.”
Asked at Sunday’s press conference whether the Senate’s return is an indication lawmakers are ready to move on transit funding or a budget, Shapiro said, “I’m not going to negotiate with Leader Bradford and Leader Pittman through the media.”
However, in recent weeks Pittman has also told reporters that Republicans are interested in school choice measures — public funding to help families afford private school tuition.
The issue represents a particular sore spot for some Republicans supporters, and a stain on their relationship with Shapiro. In 2023, after backing the GOP-supported plan to include funding for school vouchers in that year’s budget, Shapiro ultimately reneged. The House Democratic majority refused to pass a budget that had already passed the Senate over the measure, so Shapiro agreed to veto the funding if the chamber passed the legislation.
Pittman has also signaled support for regulating so-called skill games, slot machine-like devices that have grown common in Pennsylvania restaurants and corner stores. As it stands, they’re not subject to taxes and regulations like the games found in casinos.
Taxing skill games is one proposal to bring in new revenue and fill the state’s deficit. Another proposal, legalizing and taxing recreational marijuana, is supported by House Democrats and a handful of GOP lawmakers, but Senate Republican leaders like Ward and Pittman have thrown cold water on the idea.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_6205-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-10 20:56:17.207817

As a single mother working three jobs to support her two children, her family is one of thousands in the region who rely on the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA).
With the transit agency that serves some 800,000 people daily just days away from implementing service cuts, if funding isn’t delivered from the state, she and a group of lawmakers on Sunday had a clear message.
“It seems that there has been a war declared on our community,” Fingerhold said. “And the politicians who serve Harrisburg, you need to wake up.”
“You need to get it together. You need to do your job, and you need to fund SEPTA,” she added. “We, the working people, do our job every day. It’s time to do your job and put working families over billionaires.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Fingerhood was one of several speakers at a press conference on Sunday at SEPTA’s headquarters in Philadelphia, as Gov. Josh Shapiro and Democrats apply a full court press to get the transportation spending bill approved along with a state budget.
“We are past the point of short-term stopgap measures. We are past the point of a few months of fixes,” Shapiro said. “It is time to have recurring long term revenue for SEPTA and for the other mass transit agencies across Pennsylvania, and the time to act is now.”
Shapiro’s budget proposal included a spending package that would fund mass transit agencies across the state and increase spending for roads and bridges.
The state House has passed legislation on multiple occasions, but it has not advanced in the Senate.

The latest bill Democrats have put forward is House Bill 1788, authored by Rep. Sean Dougherty (D-Philadelphia). The bill would provide $600 million to mass transit and roads and bridges, while also increasing accountability on the transit agencies and public-private projects. The accountability portion of the proposal was originally put forth by GOP Sen. Joe Picozzi, of Philadelphia.
The House Transportation Committee voted to advance this bill by a 16-10 vote on Wednesday with the support of every Democrat and two Bucks County Republicans.
Shapiro said he met with SEPTA General Manager Scott Sauer, state Transportation Secretary Mike Carroll and other leaders about the urgency of the issue.
“I want to be clear. We do not want to make these devastating changes,” Sauer said. “However, without a funding solution, we will have to advance a 20% service cut that starts on August 24 and an overall 45% cut this fiscal year.”
Shapiro lauded Sauer’s leadership and said SEPTA’s GM walked him through some of the changes made by the transit agency to create a “far more efficient operation.”
Sauer said that SEPTA has enacted an austerity plan that has resulted in more than $30 million in savings over the last eight months, lowered its structural budget deficit from $240 million to $213 million and is embracing the accountability and oversight measures being considered by the General Assembly. He also noted that ridership is up for the fiscal year that just ended and that they have seen a reduction in crime on the system.

“I’m confident that SEPTA is on the rise, and all of us have embraced a customer focused mission that puts safety and security, reliability and service at the forefront, and if we can get the support that’s needed to avoid these devastating cuts, we’ll move swiftly to implement new initiatives that will enhance service across the system,” Sauer said.
Lt. Gov. Austin Davis was also in Pittsburgh on Sunday in an effort to raise awareness about mass transit funding. Adam Brandolph, a spokesperson for the Pittsburgh Regional Transit (PRT), told the Capital-Star earlier in the week that although they don’t have a “hard and fast deadline” at this current time for state funding, service cuts and fare increases will not occur until February 2026 at the earliest.
House members returned to Harrisburg for a voting session on Sunday and the Senate is due back in session on Tuesday, But, a budget bill passed by the House still has not been taken up by the GOP-controlled Senate.

Senate President Pro Tempore Kim Ward (R-Westmoreland) said she would support a short-term budget solution that would allow the commonwealth to provide funding for school districts and local governments, City & State PA reported on Aug. 5.
However, Shapiro said he is not open to a short-term budget proposal.
“I can tell you the time for short-term spending plans is long over and will not be entertained by me,” Shapiro said on Sunday. “We need to pass an annual budget, and that annual budget needs to fund mass transit.”
“Lawmakers have very few enumerated responsibilities. One of them is to pass an annual budget,” he added. “It’s time for them to do that now.”
One proposal championed by Sen. Sharif Street (D-Philadelphia) would legalize adult-use cannabis that would provide funding for mass transit agencies.
“So, that bill has support from Senate Republicans, House Republicans, House Democrats and Senate Democrats. It is both bicameral and bipartisan,” Street told reporters. “It would provide adequate funding to fund mass transit and transportation on a recurring basis for the foreseeable future. So it’s not a one time fix. It’s a permanent fix, and certainly, I think all things remain on the table until there’s a solution.”
However, Republican leaders in the Senate have not appeared to be as open to passing adult-use cannabis legislation.
Another recent change for SEPTA was a state-appointed special prosecutor beginning to prosecute incidents taking place on the transit system. That was the result of a bill that passed the General Assembly with bipartisan support and signed into law by Shapiro, despite opposition from Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner, who argued it was unconstitutional.

State Attorney General Dave Sunday told NBC 10 in Philadelphia in late July that he believes the term for the prosecutor, which is set to expire at the end of 2026, should be extended.
“I think if it is extended, maybe with a few tweaks, I think that we will be in a place where we can really provide a tremendous value added to the citizens of Philadelphia,” he said.
Shapiro didn’t endorse or dismiss the possibility of extending it past the current deadline.
“Well, it’s in place until the end of next year,” Shapiro said in response to a question from the Capital-Star. “And if that’s an issue that’s important to folks who are involved in the conversations, I’m sure we’ll talk about it.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/septa_sign_august_2025_720.jpg,,,2025-08-10 18:56:31.953458

(Photo courtesy of the Wisconsin Department of Corrections)Rian Nyblom, 18, was sentenced to five years in prison Wednesday after pleading guilty to charges stemming from the death of a staff member at Wisconsin’s infamous juvenile prison, the Lincoln Hills School for Boys. Nyblom pleaded guilty in April to two counts of being party to a crime of battery by a prisoner, a deal which reduced felony murder charges, and dropped an additional battery charge, against the teen, the AP reported. 
Prosecutors say that in June 2024, tensions arose between a then- 16-year-old Lincoln Hills resident and a female guard who the teen felt was abusing her power. The 16-year-old threw a cup of what he believed was soap on her, and proceeded to punch her repeatedly. When the teen ran out into the courtyard 49-year-old staff member Corey Proulx followed. After Proulx scuffled with  the teen, he sustained a head injury after falling to the pavement. Proulx died a day later. 
Nyblom allegedly told investigators that he knew of the 16-year-old’s issues with the female guard. Shortly before the fighting began Nyblom retrieved extra soup and conditioner, he told investigators, and gave it to the 16-year-old. Nyblom said he hadn’t witnessed the attack on the female guard, but did see the teen hit Proulx. 
Nyblom was sentenced to five years in prison, with 405 days counted as time served. He was transferred to the Lincoln County Jail last year. The 18-year-old had been sent to Lincoln Hills after being charged with misdemeanor criminal damage to property and disorderly conduct. To those charges, AP reported, Nyblom pleaded no contest and was found guilty in May. 
The teen to whom Nyblom supplied the soup and conditioner, who is now 17, faces one count of first-degree reckless homicide, and two counts of battery by a prisoner, and is charged as an adult. He has pleaded not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect, with a trial expected to begin in February. It’s possible that the teen’s lawyers will attempt to move the case back to juvenile court.
As of Aug. 1, there were 80 boys in Lincoln Hills, four girls in the Copper Lake School, and 26 youth at the Mendota Juvenile Treatment Facility, according to the Department of Corrections’ latest population report. That’s slightly up from the 78 boys held at Lincoln Hills in late April. The higher population number at the juvenile prison was noted by the Lincoln Hills’ court-ordered monitor around that same time. The monitor also highlighted enduring staffing vacancies and, in the past, had complained about staff treating students poorly, even exhibiting racist behaviors. 
In August 2024, following Proulx’s death, Republican lawmakers wrote letters to DOC Sec. Jared Hoy saying that Lincoln Hills had become less safe, and blamed the consent decree for limiting the ability of staff to use force against juvenile residents.

Fueled by hot summer weather and persistent drought conditions across the western half of the state, wildfires as of Aug. 8 had burned more than 100,000 acres in Colorado in 2025.
By that time it was already Colorado’s worst fire year since 2020, when multiple historic blazes burned a record-setting 625,357 acres, according to National Interagency Fire Center data.
Drought conditions classified as “severe” or “extreme” extend across the majority of the Western Slope, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. A critical fire weather advisory for western Colorado and several neighboring states has been issued by the Rocky Mountain Area Coordination Center, a Denver-based branch of the NIFC, and will remain in place through at least mid-August.

“After a dry winter with minimal snowpack fuel moistures are well below normal, and much of the region is under severe to extreme drought,” the agency warns. “Extreme fire behavior marked by rapid spread, torching, and resistance to control is being driven by critically dry … fuels, and drought-stressed brush and trees. As heat intensifies and fuel moistures decline further, fire potential will remain elevated across the area.”
Here is a look at three 2025 Colorado fires:

The Lee Fire, west of the town of Meeker in Rio Blanco County, has burned an estimated 106,672 acres with 6% containment as of Aug. 10. It’s believed to have been caused by lightning on Aug. 2.
The nearby Elk Fire, southeast of Meeker, is also believed to have been caused by lightning on Aug. 2. It has burned an estimated 14,635 as of Aug. 8, and is 9% contained.
The Turner Gulch Fire, east of Gateway near the Colorado-Utah border in Mesa County, is 49% contained and has burned an estimated 28,403 acres since it was started by lightning on July 10.

Gov. Jared Polis recently issued disaster declarations for fires in Delta, Mesa, Montrose and Rio Blanco counties. On Aug. 6, he mobilized the Colorado National Guard to support firefighting efforts on the Lee and Elk fires.
Due to climate change, much of Colorado has grown hotter and drier in recent decades, increasing wildfire risk. The three largest wildfires in Colorado history all occurred in 2020, and the state’s 20 biggest fires on record have all occurred in the past 20 years. Rising levels of greenhouse gases, mostly the result of fossil-fuel combustion, have caused much of the Western Slope to warm by an average of more than 4 degrees Fahrenheit above pre-industrial levels, and the region’s current “megadrought” is its worst dry spell in at least 1,200 years.
Most wildfires are caused by human activity. To minimize the risk of sparking a fire, authorities urge visitors to national forests and other public lands to follow local fire restrictions, ensure that vehicles are properly maintained and trailer chains are secured, and avoid driving or parking on dry grass.
In 2017, the State Forest Service reported that more than 2.9 million Coloradans lived in the “wildland-urban interface” — areas at risk of being impacted by wildfires. Fire safety experts urge residents of such zones to familiarize themselves with the “Ready, Set, Go” system of precautions.

Western Slope wildfires already add up to Colorado’s worst fire year since 2020


By: Chase Woodruff - Wednesday August 6, 2025 2:23 pm


















High winds and extreme drought conditions in northwest Colorado have fueled the rapid growth of two wildfires this week near Meeker in Rio Blanco County, where firefighting crews say they’re prioritizing structure protection with “limited resources” on hand.
The Lee Fire, west of Meeker, nearly doubled in size Tuesday and has now burned 22,497 acres, predominantly on Bureau of Land Management land south of Colorado Highway 13. About 20 miles to the east, the Elk Fire is estimated at 8,304 acres in size. Both fires are believed to have been started by lightning strikes on Aug. 2.
With the latest growth, the estimated area burned in Colorado by 11 major wildfires in 2025 now stands at 64,196 acres, according to federal data. That doesn’t include smaller fires suppressed by state and local first responders, but it already makes for the state’s worst fire year since 2020.

(Library of Congress)On the big hill west of town they met on hot summer nights beneath a wooden cross illuminated with electric bulbs. Purists might have said the cross should have been flaming, but at least there were the hoods and the white robes and the desperate oaths and the silly language rife with the letter “k.”
This wasn’t the original Ku Klux Klan, the secret society formed by a half-dozen former Confederate officers in 1865 to terrorize newly freed Black people and to fight Reconstruction. That first Klan had been dismantled by 1872 and its hooded leaders jailed.
No, this was a reimagined Klan, a movement that had been sweeping Main Street America in a wave of nostalgia and bigotry. What was happening at night on the big hill just outside Coffeyville was similar to other meetings held across the country, with Protestant religion and patriotic fervor masking the worst impulses of those beneath the hoods.
The meetings weren’t strictly social occasions.
The Klan was organizing, running candidates for office, and attempting to insinuate itself into every aspect of civic life, under the guise that it was doing good charitable and patriotic work.
One citizen who wasn’t buying it was A.J. Valentine.
Valentine was the 39-year-old editor of the Coffeyville Morning News who thought the Klan meetings were both absurd and dangerous. In October 1922, he announced that the News had an informant in the ranks of the local Klan.
“One of the indoor sports in Coffeyville for several months has been figuring out who are the members of the cow pasture parties, held around Coffeyville about once a week,” a Page One notice read. “These parties have created so much interest that The Morning News has undertaken to enlighten its readers about them. So beginning tomorrow morning the News will start a serial story, giving the license tag numbers of these cars that assemble in cow pastures, also the owners of the cars, as shown by the secretary of state’s records.”
It was a risky move for Valentine.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
A rival editor would later note, in a 1943 local history, that what Valentine may have lacked in discretion he made up for in bravery.
“Mr. Valentine was a courageous editor,” remembered local newspaperman C.C. Drake, who had helmed the Daily Dawn — a Klan newspaper. “He opposed the invasion of the Ku Klux Klan here and created a good deal of discussion as to the identity of his Klan reporter, who ignored the secrecy of the order and boldly published many inner happenings.”
Valentine’s paper was an upstart not yet three years old, struggling against the well-established Coffeyville Journal and other publications, including by 1923 the Daily Dawn.
Valentine had been born in Louisiana, married his wife, Mary, in Missouri, and had worked there as a bank solicitor. He came to Coffeyville in 1912 to become advertising manager for the Journal and was later elected county clerk as a Democrat. The Morning News had leaned Democratic from the start, Drake noted in his local history, but Valentine was never tied to party dogma.
The summer of 1922 had burned like a torch as the resurrected Klan spread its hooded influence across Kansas, its kleagles organizing new chapters in towns big and small. It may have seemed an unusual turn for a state that had been admitted to the Union as free on the eve of the Civil War, but that had been 61 years ago, and Kansans, like just about everyone else in America, had been buffeted by change.
A world war, a pandemic, and the disorienting rush of the Jazz Age had frightened many into longing for an imagined earlier time, a fictional America where there was moral order and political stability. There was also a cancerous nostalgic yearning for a time before so many people had so many freedoms. Like the old Klan, the resurrected version targeted Black people, Jews and Catholics.
Encouraged by the 1915 film “Birth of a Nation,” the first blockbuster, which portrayed the original Klansman as heroes and Black people and carpetbaggers as rapists and villains, Americans in the millions flocked to join the new “Invisible Empire.”
For them, the hood and robes and fiery crosses had become symbols for real Americans, an exclusive club of white Protestant men (although there was a women’s auxiliary). If old Nathan Bedford Forrest had lived to see the new Klan he would have been perplexed, because the organization claimed to revere the American flag, a symbol of union the original Kluxers reviled.
Most of the 1920s Klan members were described as solid middle class citizens, according to historian Tim Rives, who wrote a history of the Klan in Kansas City.
“The stimulus to this Klan’s creation is more mysterious” than the original Klan or the one that would resurface in the 1960s to oppose the civil rights movement, according to Rives. “Its program of Americanism, Protestantism, Law and Order, and White Supremacy (was) less definite than the simpler hates of other Klan eras. The amorphous character of the Klan of the 1920s gave it the flexibility to adjust to whatever local conditions it found.”
Coffeyville became a stronghold of Klan activity, with the local chapter of the Invisible Empire railing against the perceived lawlessness of South Coffeyville, a town a mile to the south, across the Oklahoma line. It was Prohibition, and the Klan said bootleggers from South Coffeyville were a corrupting influence. But then, it thought jazz music and teen necking parties were wicked, too.
Valentine’s Klan reporter, whoever he was, first appeared in the Oct. 11, 1922, edition of the Morning News. The writer took the tone of a society editor reporting a black tie affair.
“One of the most delightful cow pasture parties of the season was held on the big hill west of the city,” the piece began. “It was a masquerade affair, white robe and white mask completely concealing the identity of each guest. The decorations consisted of a large cross which was lit up with electric light bulbs — the cows having been removed before the fun started.”
In a ceremony called “naturalization,” an oath was administered to new members, requiring allegiance to the Invisible Empire. The initiates were required to swear they would die before divulging Klan secrets.
“The guests did not give their names to the News’ cow pasture society reporter but the following automobile tags were noticed attached to the cars that were assembled.” A list of 10 tag numbers and the names the secretary of state had registered for each vehicle followed.
“At a late hour refreshments were served,” the reporter noted.
Over the next few days, additional installments in the cow pasture saga identified more vehicles and their owners. Letters began appearing in the Morning News from citizens who claimed somebody else had borrowed their cars to attend the Klan meeting. In one case, the executive of a pipeline company said he was the owner of record for a number of company vehicles, but he couldn’t control the movements of every auto.
Some of the hoods, at least, were finally off.
Other Kansas journalists had squared off against the Klan, with Emporia’s William Allen White the most noted. But Valentine, a relatively obscure editor astride a powder keg of bigotry and popular influence, may have had the most to lose.
He certainly was among the most audacious.
But Klan influence continued to swell in southeast Kansas, culminating in the beating of a local mayor, Theodore Schierlmann. His offense? He was Catholic, had spoken out against the Klan, and had refused to rent a local hall for a Klan function.
“Reign of Terror is On,” a Morning News headline declared.
On Oct. 30, Gov. Henry J. Allen came to Coffeyville and during a speech at a local theater denounced the Klan. It was a secret order, he said, operating without benefit of a state charter as required of other social and fraternal organizations.
“We confront in Kansas an astonishing development of prejudice, racial and religious,” Allen said, as reported by the Associated Press. “It is seeking to establish the un-American idea that we can improve the conditions in the state by turning it over to a masked organization which arrogates to itself the right to regulate the individual.”
Allen, a Republican, said he had instructed the state attorney general to expel every Klan official from the state.
The organization, he said, “has taken the old Ku Klux Klan from its grave. It has set up the incredible philosophy that we require religious instruction from masked men whose characters and capacities are concealed by disguise.”
On Dec. 8, 1924, an explosion wrecked the publishing offices and plant of the Daily Dawn, the Klan newspaper. Nobody was hurt in the 1 a.m. blast, but damage was estimated at $75,000 — or about $1.4 million in today’s dollars.
“Nitroglycerine was used,” reported a Nevada, Missouri, newspaper. “Besides wrecking the newspaper plant the blast badly damaged an adjoining grocery store, a bicycle shop and a florist shop. Almost the entire roof of the Daily Dawn building was blown off and the front and rear walls were blown out. Windows for several blocks were shattered.”
The damage wasn’t covered by insurance, editor C.C. Drake said. The newspapers the Journal and the Morning News offered the use of their plants to Drake, who attributed the blast to bootleggers. Although there were various suspects over the years, there were no arrests. The paper ceased operations in 1925.
Also in 1925, the Klan was officially declared illegal in Kansas.
But the legacy of the Klan lived on, especially in places like Kansas City, where a former Klansman held office for 30 years, according to Rives. There were also at least 41 incidents of lynching of Black people across the state to 1927, and perhaps more.
Race relations in Coffeyville boiled over when a white mob of thousands stormed city hall in 1927 seeking to lynch three Black men. The men had been falsely accused of raping two white high school girls. Although the Klan was not involved in the riot, the incident had the potential to be a disaster similar to the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre, which left up to 300 Black people dead and destroyed the city’s prosperous African American neighborhood.
“The (Coffeyville) mob was driven back,” according to Geoffrey Newman in a 2013 master’s thesis, “first by Black deputies at the jail, then by armed African Americans who prevented their neighborhood from being torched. The National Guard occupied the city for five days.”
The incident was largely forgotten local history, Newman said, but deserved to be remembered.
“Coffeyville demands our attention because its activists won a victory against racism almost 25 years before the Montgomery Bus Boycott,” he argued. “Furthermore, the victory had its roots in a little-known court case that desegrated junior high schools statewide in Kansas 30 years before Brown. Yet these victories never created a national wave of change. Kansas … has remained remote from the centers of national discourse on race.”
In 1928, Valentine sold the Morning News. The paper was absorbed by the Journal the next year. In 1929, he took over as editor of a paper at Lincoln, Nebraska, and by 1940 was running a bookstore there.
Andrew Jackson Valentine died in 1966, aged 82.
His story — that of a small-town editor fighting a cultural torrent of hypocrisy and violence — is a just a minor part of the American saga. But it’s a story worth remembering, because all history is ultimately local history. What we do has meaning. Our individual acts of kindness and cruelty, our refusals to remember and our embrace of the past, imagined or actual, contribute to who we are as a nation.
Personally, I’d rather live in the America that A.J. Valentine thought was worth saving.

More than 60% of Idaho is federal public land. (Clark Corbin/Idaho Capital Sun)A Republican state senator from Nampa said he will introduce a proposed amendment to the Idaho Constitution that would prevent the state of Idaho from selling any future public lands granted or obtained from the federal government.
Sen. Ben Adams, R-Nampa, said he will introduce the proposed constitutional amendment at the beginning of the 2026 session of the Idaho Legislature, which begins in January.
He hopes the amendment will go before voters in the November 2026 general election.
“The idea of selling public land really didn’t sit well with me,” Adams said in a phone interview Friday morning. “I have young kids and we like to hike and we like to fish, and our public lands here in Idaho have so many amazing places to do all of those things. Selling it off is just not an option in my mind.”

Access to public lands became a flashpoint this year after U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, introduced an unsuccessful proposal in Congress that would have allowed millions of acres of public land, including in Idaho, to be sold off to the highest bidder.
Lee ultimately removed his public lands sell off proposal from an earlier version of the so-called “Big Beautiful Bill” following a public backlash that included opposition from within the Republican Party by U.S. Sens. Mike Crapo and Jim Risch and U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson, all R-Idaho.
How would the proposed public lands amendment in Idaho work?
If the amendment passes, it would create a new land trust and all future new public lands granted by or acquired from the federal government would be placed into that trust, Adams said.
The amendment would not change anything for the roughly 2.5 million acres of state endowment land Idaho already has, Adams said. Under the Idaho Constitution, existing state endowment lands are managed to secure the “maximum long term financial return” to the state and beneficiaries, which means the land can be sold. That’s not changing.
Instead, the new amendment would apply to all new and future public lands that would be placed into a new trust created by the amendment. That land could not be sold.
“In this new land trust, there is no provision for maximum financial return,” Adams said.
Instead, those new lands would be managed to allow for multiple uses, including recreation, timber harvest and grazing. Adams said revenue raised by grazing and timber harvest would support rural schools in communities that are surrounded by public lands and have a smaller property tax base.
As for the specifics of the amendment, Adams said he will unveil the text of the proposed constitutional amendment during a free, public kickoff event at noon on Aug. 15 at the Pine Cafe in the small mountain town of Pine, which is located in Elmore County and situated along the South Fork of the Boise River.
Adams picked the spot because he enjoys fishing in the area and Pine is surrounded by public lands, which guests will drive through and experience on their way to the kickoff event.
Adams, a retired U.S. Marine Corps sergeant who saw two combat tours in Afghanistan, said Idahoans have many different reasons for enjoying public lands.
“It’s where I healed when I came back from deploying overseas,” Adams said. “It’s wide-open and you can be all alone. On public lands every man is a king, and it is the only place in the world you can do that. It’s because it belongs to you, and it belongs to all of us.”
What is the process for amending Idaho’s constitution?
To pass, the proposed amendment to the Idaho Constitution must receive at least a two-thirds supermajority of support from both the Idaho Senate and the Idaho House of Representatives.
If that happens, the amendment would go before voters in the November 2026 general election, where it would require a simple majority vote to pass.
Although there is a high bar for amending the Idaho Constitution, Adams said support for public land crosses political lines and he is confident the amendment will receive the two-thirds support in both chambers of the Idaho Legislature.
“It’s a huge issue given the times we are living in, and it’s good to fight for something we all agree on,” Adams said.
Public lands have near universal public support in Idaho
More than 60% of all land in Idaho is public land of some form, including U.S. Forest Service land and Bureau of Land Management land.
Public land, where Idahoans and visitors enjoy hunting, hiking, fishing, camping, snowmobiling, bird and wildlife watching, climbing, skiing and more, is extremely popular with Idaho voters.
In the wake of this year’s proposed public lands sell off, a poll sponsored by Conservation Voters for Idaho found that 96% of all registered voters in Idaho believe public lands should stay in public hands, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported.
Adams told the Sun he began working on his proposed amendment at the end of this year’s legislative session.
“At that point this idea had legs, but once Sen. Lee proposed selling off millions of acres of public lands, it gave this idea wings and I knew this was the right time to put it out,” Adams said.

(File photo courtesy of Jacob W. Frank/ Yellowstone National Park)A coalition of outdoor sporting groups intend to appeal the decision of a federal judge in Montana made last week that directed the federal government to reconsider whether gray wolves in the Rocky Mountains require additional protections under the Endangered Species Act.
The Sportsmen’s Alliance Foundation, Safari Club International and the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation on Wednesday submitted their notice to appeal the decision of U.S. District Court Judge Donald Molloy of Montana to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.
Wolves remain under state control in Idaho following legal victory for conservationists 

“This ruling is the latest string of nonstop litigation by environmental groups seeking to frustrate the original intent of the ESA, which is to recover endangered species and return them to state-based management, not keep them perpetually listed and under the authority of the federal government,” Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation President and CEO Kyle Weaver said in a press release. “Whether it’s the wolf or the grizzly bear, once an animal receives ESA protections, it becomes nearly impossible to remove them, even if populations meet recovery criteria over an extended period of time. The ESA needs an adjustment to renew its focus on real species recovery.”
In Tuesday’s ruling, Molloy vacated a 2024 determination made by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service that gray wolves in the Western United States do not need increased federal protections.
Currently, gray wolves are listed as an endangered species in the contiguous 48 states, except in the Northern Rockies — Idaho, Montana, Wyoming and parts of Oregon and Washington — after management of the species in those regions was given over to the states following Congressional action in 2011.
 Conservationists argued in lawsuit that states are using inadequate scientific methods to assess wolf populations

A coalition of more than 70 environmental and conservation organizations submitted a petition to the federal government in 2021, asking the Fish and Wildlife Service to relist gray wolves in the Northern Rockies, or create a western Distinct Population Segment, or DPS, for the species with added protections.
The coalition argued in its petition, and subsequent lawsuit following the Fish and Wildlife Service’s determination against added protections, that due to concerns that states are using inadequate scientific methods to assess population statistics, harsh political rhetoric and increased mandates in Montana and Idaho to reduce wolf populations, and because wolves do not inhabit the full extent of their historic range — which once broadly comprised the entire western U.S — the species meets the criteria for reconsideration under the Endangered Species Act.
Ghost wolves: As Idaho aims to reduce its wolf population, advocates worry counts aren’t accurate

“Management of Canis lupus must not be by a political yo-yo process,” Molloy wrote, adding that the federal government had “failed to use the best available science” in its species analysis.
Molloy’s ruling requires the Fish and Wildlife Service to reevaluate whether gray wolves should receive increased federal protections.
 Montana state officials disagree with federal judge’s wolf ruling

While members of the conservation coalition praised Tuesday’s decision, officials in Montana, which joined the lawsuit as an intervenor-defendant, and Idaho, which filed an amicus brief on behalf of the federal government, disagreed with the ruling by an “activist judge.”
“Montana has a healthy, sustainable population of wolves. While we are reviewing the decision, it will not implicate our state’s management efforts or our wolf season,” said Kaitlin Price, a spokesperson for Gov. Greg Gianforte’s office. “Unfortunately, we’re not surprised to see another activist decision in favor of environmental extremists.”
Price said that if the Fish and Wildlife Service appeals the decision, Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks “will be there to support them.”
Price could not be reached before publication about whether the state and Fish, Wildlife and Parks would sign on to the current notice of appeal.
“We’re extremely disappointed with the decision considering Idaho has managed a wolf population above federal recovery goals for decades and sustained more-than-adequate wolf populations since Congress removed them from Endangered Species Act protection in 2011,” Idaho Fish and Game Director Jim Fredericks told the Idaho Capital Sun in a written statement.
Molloy’s ruling does not currently change the status of gray wolves, which are managed by each state’s respective wildlife agency.
In Montana, where gray wolves number approximately 1,100, Fish, Wildlife and Parks has proposed new hunting and trapping regulations for the upcoming wolf season that would set a statewide quota of 500 animals — up from 334 in 2024 — and would significantly increase bag limits allowing hunters and trappers to kill up to 15 wolves on a single hunting or trapping license, for up to 30 total wolves.
Arguments from the coalition in support of its appeal are expected to be filed soon, according to Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation staff.
“We had to appeal this decision,” Michael Jean, litigation counsel for Sportsmen’s Alliance Foundation, said in a press statement. “This decision seems to hold that unless a species is not recovered across its entire historical range, then it has to stay listed — regardless of thriving populations. It’s difficult to see how the wolf, or other listed species, will ever be deemed recovered under that standard.”

A new study found that hospitals are increasingly buying up private physician-owned practices, and costs for services are rising. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)As more hospitals have gobbled up private physician practices, costs for childbirth and other services have gone up, according to a new study.
Since the early aughts, the share of physicians in the United States working for hospitals has nearly doubled, according to the study published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, a nonprofit research organization.
And as fewer doctors work in physician-owned practices, patients or their insurers end up paying more, the study’s authors found.
For example: Two years after a hospital buys an OB-GYN practice, prices for labor and delivery jump an average of $475 and physician prices rise by $502, according to the study. Researchers focused on births, which are the most common reason for hospital admission among people with private insurance.
This rapid acquisition by hospitals is reshaping a U.S. industry once dominated by tens of thousands of small, physician-owned practices.
Only about 42% of U.S. physicians work in a physician-owned private practice, according to the most recent survey data from the American Medical Association. Nearly 47% work for hospitals, a sharp rise over the past several years. Most emergency room physicians are now employed by hospital systems or by private equity-owned staffing groups.
The new research offers further evidence for how hospital acquisitions of private practices “can result in anticompetitive price increases,” said Matthew Grennan, one of the study’s authors and an associate professor of economics at Emory University, in a news release.
“As a result, I think economists and others in the antitrust community are likely to give more careful consideration to these potential sources of harm,” he said.
Medical debt is a leading cause of bankruptcy in the United States, with about 14 million Americans owing more than $1,000 in medical debt, according to research nonprofit KFF.
These post-merger price increases are driven by reduced competition, Grennan and his fellow researchers found. Yet there’s been little effort by federal or state regulators to halt hospital mergers that could lead to higher prices for consumers.
But states have taken some steps toward lowering medical costs in recent years.
Bipartisan groups of lawmakers in more than a dozen states have addressed so-called “facility fees,” which are charges that some hospitals tack on for patient visits to hospital-owned physician offices.
This year in Oklahoma, Republican lawmakers passed a bill requiring hospitals to make the cost of many of their services more transparent to patients so they’re aware of the costs. Providers can face penalties for noncompliance. A similar Oklahoma law authored by Democrats and passed last year requires debt collectors to submit evidence of a hospital’s compliance with price transparency rules before filing to collect on medical debts from patients.
Some states have capped the rates hospitals or physicians can charge. Colorado sets provider and hospitals rates based on a specific formula if insurance plans aren’t able to lower peoples’ premiums to a certain level, while Montana and Oregon limited the amount hospitals and other providers can charge for their state employee health plan.

(Photo by Jessica Holdman/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA, S.C. — South Carolina Republicans attending the party’s annual fundraiser received a surprise phone call Saturday night from a previous keynote speaker — President Donald Trump.
U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, who’s seeking re-election next year, took to the stage of the 58th annual Silver Elephant Gala and held his cellphone to the microphone so the president could speak to the crowd that twice helped elect him to the White House.
The unexpected call upstaged the main speaker for the event: Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin.
“I will never forget your great state. South Carolina is a special state, and you’ve made it that way,” Trump told the nearly 770 Republicans in attendance.
Graham never mentioned his own campaign for a fifth term. Instead, he let Trump do the talking about his “full endorsement” of South Carolina’s senior senator.
“He’s a great guy. Every time I needed him, he was there for me, so I just won’t forget it,” Trump said on the call, earning whoops from the crowd.
“I don’t think it’s going to be a contest,” Trump added about Graham’s re-election. “I have a feeling you’re going to do very well.”
The surprise call stemmed from the golf course. Graham said he and former U.S. Rep. Trey Gowdy played golf with Trump earlier in the day, though he didn’t say where.
“President Trump is an incredibly good golfer,” he said in introducing the call. “I have never played with anybody that consistent all the time.”
During the three-minute call, Trump also gave shout outs to Gov. Henry McMaster, first lady Peggy McMaster and state GOP Chairman Drew McKissick.
As Trump said goodbye and told attendees to have fun, the crowd clapped and cheered. It was the biggest applause of the night.
Trump carried 55% and 58% of the vote in South Carolina in 2016 and 2024, respectively. And even though he did not win the national race in 2020, Trump took 55% of South Carolinians’ vote that year.
The dinner, which cost donors up to $1,000 for a private pre-dinner reception, is the state party’s largest annual fundraiser. When Trump was the keynote speaker in 2023, he drew a record crowd of more than 1,300 people.

Other past headliners include former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in 2021 and former Vice President Mike Pence in 2008, when he was an Indiana congressman. Then-Gov. Ronald Reagan was the speaker in 1967 for the inaugural Silver Elephant. Other former presidents to give the keynote address include Richard Nixon and George W. Bush.
Candidates and endorsements
The gala came a day after former Lt. Gov. Andre Bauer suspended his bid to challenge Graham. Bauer announced his exit on social media just one month after launching his campaign.
Bauer’s departure left two Republicans in the race to unseat Graham. Paul Dans of Charleston, who attended the gala, said Graham’s Trump phone stunt “smacked of desperation.”
“It was a very bad miscue by the Graham campaign to try to force feed this endorsement to the people,” Dans, an architect of the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025, told reporters at the event.
Graham wasn’t the only 2026 candidate on stage Saturday.
Three other hopefuls “paid to sponsor for the privilege to come to address you beautiful people this evening,” McKissick announced before handing over the mic.
Attendees heard stump speeches from Attorney General Alan Wilson, who is running for governor; state Sen. Stephen Goldfinch of Murrells Inlet, who is running to replace Wilson as attorney general; and state Sen. Wes Climer of Rock Hill, who is running for Congress to replace another gubernatorial candidate, U.S. Rep. Ralph Norman of the 5th District.
“For those of you that are still on the fence, I just want the opportunity to earn your vote, earn your trust, to earn an opportunity to serve you as your governor,” Wilson told attendees.
Wilson, who’s in his fourth term as attorney general, was the only candidate among those who paid to speak who has an official GOP opponent for the June 2026 primaries.
So far, five Republicans have announced bids to replace McMaster, who can’t run again. Wilson was the first to hold an official launch event, though the race unofficially started soon after the November elections.
“The governor must not only be an agent of reform and change; the governor cannot be an agent of chaos,” he added.
U.S. Rep. Nancy Mace of the coastal 1st District was the latest Republican to announce her bid, but she’s been pummeling her opponents on social media and at GOP events for months. She’s directed most of her ire at Wilson. Mace did not attend the gala.
Two other gubernatorial candidates — Lt. Gov. Pam Evette and Norman, the 5th District congressman — were there but did not address the crowd.
‘Know how to win’
In his main address following the campaign speeches, Youngkin invoked the fighting spirit of Revolutionary War hero Francis Marion.
He encouraged South Carolina Republicans to follow the Swamp Fox’s lead heading into the 2026 midterms that will decide whether the GOP will continue to control Congress.
“We don’t follow; we lead. And that is my challenge to all of you,” Youngkin said.
“Francis Marion showed all of us how to keep the fight alive,” he added, noting the country is gearing up to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the American Revolution.
Youngkin pointed to the GOP supermajorities in both South Carolina’s House and Senate as a sign Republicans “know how to win” in the Palmetto state.
“And one of our largest missions in 2026 is to extend the majority in our House of Representatives in Washington,” he said. “That is a top priority.”
Youngkin’s election to governor in November 2021 put a Republican at the helm of the Old Dominion State for the first time in more than a decade.
“When you’re on the losing side, the consequences are dire,” Youngkin said. “When you’re on the winning side, Republicans can unleash prosperity and opportunity and lift up every South Carolinian, every Virginian, and every American. And because of those consequences, we have to continue to go to work.”
 

In his own race, Youngkin focused on education and tapped into parents’ anger over pandemic policies and classroom lessons in his upset win over former Gov. Terry McAuliffe, who was the former Democratic National Committee chairman and chief fundraiser for the campaigns of Bill and Hillary Clinton.
His winning “parents matter” message helped fuel a GOP focus on parents’ rights.
In the wake of COVID-19, Youngkin said businesses were closing.
“We saw parents shut out of their children’s lives, and they were told boldly that parents should not have a role in determining what was being taught in our schools,” he told Silver Elephant attendees Saturday. “And for nearly a decade, more people were moving out of the Commonwealth of Virginia than were moving in.
“Now, a lot of them were moving here to South Carolina,” Youngkin added to laughter from the crowd. “A lot of them are moving here to South Carolina because South Carolina still believes in common sense conservative values: faith, family, and freedom.”
As for Youngkin, his term expires in January 2026. Virigina’s constitution does not allow governors to hold consecutive terms.
There’s some speculation he could make a bid for president in 2028. No mention of that was made Saturday.

Stephen Goldfinch of Murrells Inlet, who is running to replace Wilson as attorney general; and state Sen. Wes Climer of Rock Hill, who is running for Congress to replace another gubernatorial candidate, U.S. Rep. Ralph Norman of the 5th District.
“For those of you that are still on the fence, I just want the opportunity to earn your vote, earn your trust, to earn an opportunity to serve you as your governor,” Wilson told attendees.
Wilson, who’s in his fourth term as attorney general, was the only candidate among those who paid to speak who has an official GOP opponent for the June 2026 primaries.
So far, five Republicans have announced bids to replace McMaster, who can’t run again. Wilson was the first to hold an official launch event, though the race unofficially started soon after the November elections.
“The governor must not only be an agent of reform and change; the governor cannot be an agent of chaos,” he added.
U.S. Rep. Nancy Mace of the coastal 1st District was the latest Republican to announce her bid, but she’s been pummeling her opponents on social media and at GOP events for months. She’s directed most of her ire at Wilson. Mace did not attend the gala.
Two other gubernatorial candidates — Lt. Gov. Pam Evette and Norman, the 5th District congressman — were there but did not address the crowd.
‘Know how to win’
In his main address following the campaign speeches, Youngkin invoked the fighting spirit of Revolutionary War hero Francis Marion.
He encouraged South Carolina Republicans to follow the Swamp Fox’s lead heading into the 2026 midterms that will decide whether the GOP will continue to control Congress.
“We don’t follow; we lead. And that is my challenge to all of you,” Youngkin said.
“Francis Marion showed all of us how to keep the fight alive,” he added, noting the country is gearing up to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the American Revolution.
Youngkin pointed to the GOP supermajorities in both South Carolina’s House and Senate as a sign Republicans “know how to win” in the Palmetto state.
“And one of our largest missions in 2026 is to extend the majority in our House of Representatives in Washington,” he said. “That is a top priority.”
Youngkin’s election to governor in November 2021 put a Republican at the helm of the Old Dominion State for the first time in more than a decade.
“When you’re on the losing side, the consequences are dire,” Youngkin said. “When you’re on the winning side, Republicans can unleash prosperity and opportunity and lift up every South Carolinian, every Virginian, and every American. And because of those consequences, we have to continue to go to work.”
SC GOP taps Virginia governor to headline Silver Elephant Gala fundraiser

In his own race, Youngkin focused on education and tapped into parents’ anger over pandemic policies and classroom lessons in his upset win over former Gov. Terry McAuliffe, who was the former Democratic National Committee chairman and chief fundraiser for the campaigns of Bill and Hillary Clinton.
His winning “parents matter” message helped fuel a GOP focus on parents’ rights.
In the wake of COVID-19, Youngkin said businesses were closing.
“We saw parents shut out of their children’s lives, and they were told boldly that parents should not have a role in determining what was being taught in our schools,” he told Silver Elephant attendees Saturday. “And for nearly a decade, more people were moving out of the Commonwealth of Virginia than were moving in.
“Now, a lot of them were moving here to South Carolina,” Youngkin added to laughter from the crowd. “A lot of them are moving here to South Carolina because South Carolina still believes in common sense conservative values: faith, family, and freedom.”
As for Youngkin, his term expires in January 2026. Virigina’s constitution does not allow governors to hold consecutive terms.
There’s some speculation he could make a bid for president in 2028. No mention of that was made Saturday.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/DSC_1545-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-10 12:59:55.020492

(Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)DES MOINES — U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins came to the Iowa State Fair Saturday to compete in the Governor’s Charity Steer Show — and to announce $152 million in U.S. Department of Agriculture investments for Iowa rural development projects.
Before heading to the Livestock Pavillion to show the steer Snoop Dog, Rollins announced that 19 projects in Iowa would receive funding through USDA Rural Development grant and loan programs. The announcement was made at a news conference where she was joined by Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds and state Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig.
Approved projects include a $37 million loan for the Guthrie County Hospital in Guthrie Center to expand and renovate its facility, a $5 million grant and $39 million loan for the City of Emmetsburg to replace its wastewater treatment facility, and a $27.7 million loan to the Southern Sioux County Rural Water System for the building of new wells, a treatment plant and transmission lines in Plymouth and Sioux Counties.
“This unprecedented, coordinated rural development project will help boost the rural economies, develop rural infrastructure and encourage private investments,” Rollins said.
Reynolds celebrated the investment and thanked Rollins for working closely with Iowa, saying “during this time of uncertainty in the ag economy, I’m so grateful to have a partner that we can rely on.”
She said the new investments will make a difference in rural Iowa communities. Reynolds said when she visited the Guthrie County Hospital in May, where she signed a law aimed at expanding medical training opportunities and rural health care access, the hospital CEO had told her about how much of a difference the USDA funding would make in helping the facility continue to provide health care in their community.
Rollins said the investment is part of a larger effort from President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress aimed at “putting farmers first again,” which she said is also being done through new international trade agreements, investments in farm safety net programs and agriculture components of the budget reconciliation bill passed.

Though much of the focus on discussing the “big, beautiful bill” has surrounded the cuts and changes to public assistance programs like Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Rollins said the bill “protected two million family farms from the death tax,” increased reference prices and extended clean fuel production tax credits.
“Most of the mainstream media focused on, ‘Oh, these horrible cuts that are going to cause death and destruction across the world’ — which, of course, none of that was true,” Rollins said. “In fact, we were investing more money, Congress was, into our agriculture sector and putting farmers first.”
Some agriculture policy advocates have said the budget reconciliation bill, which cuts SNAP funding while increasing spending on farm subsidies, will further consolidate the agriculture industry and benefit wealthy farmers.
It’s the second event Reynolds and Rollins have held together this week. On Monday, the Iowa governor was in Washington, D.C. for a news conference where Rollins signed six waivers approving restrictions on purchases of certain food items through the SNAP. Rollins approved Iowa’s waiver to limit unhealthy foods available to buy through SNAP in May.
USDA also approved an Iowa waiver to implement an summer eating program for kids, called Healthy Kids Iowa, earlier in the year. The demonstration project, providing a box of food valued at $40 each month for families in need through 264 access points across the state, is an alternative to the SUN Bucks program, also known as Summer EBT, that provides $120 per child each month during the summer to eligible families that can be used at retailers accepting SNAP.
Both of these efforts are aimed at reducing unhealthy eating habits, the governor said, though hunger advocates have argued these steps make it more difficult for Iowans to access food assistance.
Rollins also spoke on her announcement in July for the USDA to restructure and consolidate parts of the agency, in part by relocating some of USDA workforce outside of Washington, D.C. to five regional hubs in North Carolina, Missouri, Indiana, Colorado and Utah.
The list has “no Iowa, but there are more announcements coming,” Rollins said. She said Iowa is well represented at the USDA, with many agency employees in the state and several Iowans in USDA leadership positions.
“The bottom line is moving the power out of Washington, returning the government to the people, and having people that are better able to serve our constituents, who are closer to them,” Rollins said. “So that is the bigger (arch), but more news coming in the days to come.”

Now, the school is referred to on its website as one of the first microschools in the nation, and Fiske has seen a growing microschool movement since the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the five years since remote schooling amid pandemic-era lockdowns, microschools and homeschooling have emerged as increasingly popular alternatives to traditional public and private models. Smaller class sizes, individualized classrooms and lack of standardization are an appeal to parents, Fiske said.
“There’s this idea that people who open microschools are doing it for cultish or religious reasons, and there’s a misconception that all are like that,” Fiske said. “I’ve seen my students graduate into top colleges. There’s many ways to achieve academic success.”
Some education experts, however, have expressed concern about the growing movement. They question whether microschools are properly regulated and being held accountable, and whether they’ll pull dollars out of the public education system.
There is no federal definition of a microschool, and with the Trump administration’s plans to shutter the U.S. Department of Education, the onus is on states to figure them out.
In some states, microschools face a bind: If they operate as private schools, they’re required to meet facility, staffing and curricular standards that are often cost-prohibitive for schools their size. If they operate under homeschool laws, they face oversight, assessment mandates and reporting requirements that aren’t designed for multifamily or educator-led models.
Some states, including Georgia, Tennessee and Texas, have passed “Learning Rights Protection Acts” to codify microschools’ right to operate.
In Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts and Oregon, learning pods and microschools often face child care or private school licensing requirements if they involve multiple families, hire instructors or provide compensation for child care.
“Schools calling themselves microschools today are not what I would’ve called one back then. But I think that’s OK. It’s evolving,” Fiske said.
She pointed to the national school choice movement — and states such as West Virginia — for helping the microschool movement flourish.
In 2022, West Virginia became one of the few states to define a microschool, distinctly separating it from a private school, homeschool or learning pod.
Those classifications, and how these schools are funded and regulated, affect everything from whether a school must hire certified teachers to how it ensures student safety or civil rights protections. And with more public dollars flowing to private or hybrid learning options through vouchers and education savings accounts — to the detriment of public school funding, some argue — states will need to define these schools and their place in the ecosystem.
States will have to fill the gaps, said Weadé James, senior director of K-12 education policy with the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning policy think tank.
“Accountability can vary wildly. Some microschools aren’t required to have certified teachers, conduct annual assessments, or even guarantee civil rights protections,” said James. “If public voucher dollars are going to a microschool, there has to be some level of oversight and accountability.”
 Many microschools aren’t accredited

Microschools defy easy classification, and many advocates argue that’s by design. Don Soifer, CEO of the National Microschooling Center, an industry group, cautions lawmakers against rushing to impose fixed legal definitions.
“Innovation is happening too fast. The moment you define it in law, it becomes obsolete,” Soifer said.
A 2024 sector analysis by the National Microschooling Center — one of the only sources of national data on the topic — found that many schools are operating outside traditional education principles.
In a survey of 400 microschools across 41 states, more than 60% of founders reported they were not currently licensed educators. Eighty-four percent reported their schools were not accredited. Among prospective founders, 48% are licensed educators (though only 14% currently work in public schools), 32% come from non-education fields, and 23% are parents building schools for their own children.
Most microschools (55%) operate under homeschool laws, while others function as private schools (37%), charters (6%) or fall into unique state categories (3%), according to the analysis.
“So, you can be a private or homeschool microschool program, where you aren’t required to provide students with certified teachers, or you aren’t required to conduct annual assessments,” James said.
Often described as “homeschool hybrids” or “small-scale learning communities,” microschools often serve around 16 students or fewer, and tend to cater to families with average or above-average incomes in their area. In some states, microschools have been authorized to receive public funds through voucher programs.
Some critics note that, like private schools, microschools may charge tuition, potentially excluding lower-income families and contributing to educational disparities.
These schools often operate in commercial spaces (41%), private residences (28%) or houses of worship (25%), according to the National Microschooling Center. The center also found the movement is diversifying: 37% of prospective founders are people of color, compared with 27% of current operators.
Because building and zoning codes vary from state to state and locality to locality, many operators may be unaware of the extra costs to meet school codes standards. Fiske recalls difficulties in expanding from Washington, D.C., to Vermont, which has stricter laws on water fountain requirements.
“Most people in the U.S. starting a microschool are doing it under the radar because the regulations to open a licensed school are so intense,” Fiske said. For the new school, she recalled, “it took us forever, and we had to install ADA-compliant toilets and water fountains for just 10 kids in Vermont.”
 ‘Microschooling is not one thing’

Microschools also operate in a legal gray zone, often outside the traditional K-12 system and subject to a patchwork of state and local policies that can either support or constrain their growth.
Growth has accelerated in conservative-leaning states with robust school choice programs, such as Arizona and Florida. Other states, such as Maryland, New York and North Dakota, have more restrictive homeschool or private school laws.
“Microschooling is not one thing. These schools look different in every state, and the policy frameworks around them vary wildly,” said Soifer, of the National Microschooling Center.
What is classified as a microschool can vary from “10 kids in a basement in Kentucky” to a 200-kid schoolhouse elsewhere.
Fiske said states need to create a way for operators and parents to know what to expect in a certain state, and help willing operators get the education and business acumen they need to run the schools successfully.
“But if you look at who is starting microschools in the U.S., it’s a lot of millennial parents who may not have any teacher training but wanted to create a learning environment for their children and others in the local community,” said Fiske. “And without efforts by the state to provide some incentives to earn accreditation and information as both a school and a small business, a few of these will find themselves going under.”
 Seeking choices

After two decades working in conventional schools in the United States and around the world — including in Brazil, Egypt and Qatar — Justine Wilson turned down a high-paying leadership role at a prestigious private school. Instead, in 2023 she opened Curious and Kind Education, a two-day-a-week microschool in Sarasota, Florida, built around trust, nature-based learning and self-directed play.
Enrollment at Curious and Kind is mostly driven by word of mouth, she said. The program now has a waitlist. And Wilson has seen her enrollment grow from 18 students in her first year to roughly 100 students for the upcoming school year.
“The number of 5-year-olds on my waitlist is shocking,” she said, “and then I realized they’re COVID babies and their parents have really been driving this search for alternative schooling since the pandemic.”
James, of the Center for American Progress, questions whether microschools generally match the quality of traditional public schools, which still educate more than 80% of schoolchildren. She says families may be under the assumption that school choice options equate to better quality.
“We have created an illusion of choice to be quality, and I think a lot of families are seeking various choice options because they associate that with quality. But that doesn’t necessarily mean that where those students are going is any better than where they left,” she said.
“We need to take a closer look at what we are presenting to families,” James said. “It’s not just about having options and having a choice. It’s about having quality choice options.”
That quality, Soifer said, is what microschools are trying to achieve.
“Microschools do very well on the left, on the right … at the top end of the economy and at the fragile end of the income spectrum,” he said. “It’s really a matter of the new economy and a new way of thinking about education.”

(Photo by Ashley Murray/States Newsroom)A federal judge in Maryland ordered a nationwide halt — again — to a Trump administration order that sought to deny citizenship to babies born in the United States if neither parent is a citizen or green-card holder.
The ruling late Thursday by U.S. District Judge Deborah Boardman is the fourth to block President Donald Trump’s executive order since June. That’s when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that judges around the country had exceeded their authority by issuing nationwide blocks to presidential orders.
But the justices said lower courts could issue nationwide injunctions to class-action lawsuits on behalf of all newborns in the U.S. who might be affected. That’s what Boardman did Thursday.
Boardman rejected a request to include parents in the class-action suit.
But she identified a nationwide class of children born in the U.S. who “unquestionably would be citizens but for the Executive Order” — an order the judge said is “almost certainly unconstitutional.”
She wrote that the plaintiffs — eight undocumented mothers who are pregnant or gave birth in the U.S. — “are likely to succeed on the merits of their constitutional claim because the Executive Order contradicts the plain language of the Fourteenth amendment,” which says that “all persons” born in the U.S. are citizens of the country and of the state in which they were born.
While the immigrants would be harmed in the absence of an injunction, Boardman wrote, there would be little harm to the government by continuing to extend birthright citizenship while the lawsuit plays out.
White House to delay birthright citizenship restrictions — but may start planning now

Boardman rejected the government’s argument that she should limit her injunction to Maryland.
“That relief must include every child in the United States who is subject to the Executive Order. After all, the Executive Order does not target only children born in Maryland; it seeks to deny citizenship to ‘persons born in the United States,’” she wrote.
A government attorney declined to comment Friday on the order, and emails seeking comment from the White House were not immediately returned.
But immigrant advocates welcomed Boardman’s order.
“This is a national issue that affects every single one of us in this country,” said Ama Frimpong, legal director at CASA, which filed suit with the immigrant women. (The national immigrant advocacy organization originally stood for Central American Solidarity Association.)
The Maryland suit was one of several around the country that were filed soon after Trump’s order on “Protecting the Meaning and Value of American Citizenship,” which he issued on Jan. 20, his first day back in office.
It claimed that birthright citizenship was never meant to be a universal right, and it said that anyone born after Feb.19 — a month after the order was signed — would be denied citizenship unless one parent was a citizen or permanent legal resident.
The order was swiftly challenged. Three judges, including Boardman, issued nationwide injunctions to halt the order. When those were upheld on appeal, the government took the case to the Supreme Court, which said a national injunction could only be issued in a class-action suit with a legitimate nationwide class of plaintiffs.
Within hours of that ruling, attorneys for CASA were back in court, filing paperwork to turn their case into a class-action suit, adding women from North and South Carolina, among other states as plaintiffs.
Boardman’s approval of a class-action suit, and a national preliminary injunction, comes almost a month after a U.S. District judge in New Hampshire did the same thing.
Frimpong called Trump’s order “just a part of the usual fear tactics to make people afraid of what they believe the federal government will do — even though it will never happen because it is blatantly unlawful and unconstitutional.”
She said she anticipates that the Trump administration will again appeal the decision. She predicts the case will go through the ordinary course of litigation.
“What we are looking forward to is, once and for all, putting the issue to bed and our courts making absolutely clear that the 14th Amendment is not up for debate, and it’s not up for subjective interpretation,” Frimpong said. “It is the law, and it is going to remain the law.”

Political officials, environmental advocates and organizers speak at halftime breaks, and a recent fan-organized fundraiser collected over $25,000 for assistance to immigrant communities.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  For Vermont Green FC, soccer and social advocacy go hand in hand.","Vermont Green Football Club fans say they scored two victories last week. One was in the club’s first national championship game in the United Soccer League’s second tier, and the other was in a fan-organized fundraiser for assistance to immigrant communities.
During the club’s deep run into the playoffs, banners in the stands bore not just Vermont crests and “Allez les Verts” messages, but illustrations of U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt, and “Abolish ICE” in block letters. 
Political neutrality in soccer has been the subject of international debate at the professional level. According to Mike Jenack, a Vermont Green fan who organized much of the effort to raise over $25,000 for Migrant Justice and the Vermont Immigration Legal Defense Fund, the club’s core identity is inextricable from its founding commitment to social issues. Political advocacy is not just a silver lining, Jenack said — it’s part of why people show up in the first place.

“I have conversations frequently with people who were never fans of soccer prior to attending a Vermont Green match,” he added.
“Sports are a place (where) people should be organizing,” said Patrick Infurna, the club’s co-founder. 
Infurna described environmental justice as “the center of our mission” for Vermont Green. It’s a goal that can contain a wide variety of issues, he said. The club’s 2024 mission report details its progress toward net-zero emissions, work to address systemic racism in the sport and donations to a number of local climate organizations.
In July, the club organized a raffle benefiting the Northeast Organic Farming Association of Vermont. The nearly $4,000 raised will be a significant addition to the organization’s Farmer Emergency Fund for disaster relief, according to Lindsey Brand, a spokesperson for the organization.
“The way we tend the land and grow the food not only determines food is available for people to consume, but also how our ecosystems are stewarded,” Brand said. “Farming is really kind of a core intersectional issue.”
Beyond the club’s own limited capacity for advocacy, Infurna said, fans have created an independent network of social advocacy that springs from the same priorities. 
“We’re relying on the voices of our neighbors … to come use the platform that we’ve worked hard to build,” he said of the fans and advocates who speak at games.
The Green had its most successful season ever this year, with no losses in 22 games. The national final in Burlington, the hosts said, sold out “instantaneously.” They estimated over 5,000 people attended the game — twice the capacity of the ticketed stand.

Along with momentum on the pitch came unprecedented levels of engagement with the club’s socially-engaged fundraisers, Jenack said. His was by far the largest fan-run fundraiser in the club’s history.
Will Lambek, a spokesperson for Migrant Justice, said the club reached out shortly after its founding in 2022. This season, Lambek participated in halftime speeches at several games.
“It’s a great way to share the work of the organization and bring calls to action to a large group of people,” he said.
Lambek called the fundraising efforts at the end of the season both “tremendous” and well-timed.
“The workload is increasing because of the intensification of attacks against immigrant communities,” Lambek said.
At halftime in the national semifinal game on July 27, Lambek translated statements from Jose Ignacio “Nacho” De La Cruz, a farm worker who was detained by U.S. Customs and Border Patrol in a high-profile incident in June.
Jenack said these speeches, heard by thousands of spectators, are an important part of the club’s culture. 
“They’re telling us what it is that they do and why it matters,” he said.
The club also has held themed games like “pride night” and “labor night” in its four seasons to date, during which the club highlights local leaders in relevant organizations, and sometimes organizes donations.

Mike Popovitch, a member of the Green Mountain Bhoys — a group of ardent Green supporters — is also in a leadership group of the Vermont Federation of Nurses and Health Professionals, a local affiliate of the American Federation of Teachers. He said this kind of exposure can be important for unions to explain their work.
“A labor movement on its own cannot survive without community support,” Popovitch said.
The Green Mountain Bhoys have often been at the center of fan-led activism. The group announced a fundraiser Friday for Medical Aid for Palestinians.
The club’s affiliation with political movements has not come without disagreement, largely from visiting away fans, Jenack said. He urged any locals who don’t feel represented to attend anyway. 
“I’m still gonna shake your hand,” he said.
Infurna said he wanted to create an inclusive environment, but that the club wasn’t willing to be neutral on issues it feels are urgent.

“We don’t believe that we’re doing something so egregiously provocative or politically inappropriate,” Infurna said. “If there was somebody who is so uncomfortable with what our club is doing that they didn’t want to come, then I’m at peace with that.”

The lawsuit, filed Thursday in federal court in Denver, alleges that the Colorado law, known as Article 74, is vague to the point of being unconstitutional and interferes with the federal government’s constitutional discretion over immigration.
“The vagueness and lack of clarity surrounding the operation and scope of Article 74, coupled with the severe penalties and hardships for noncompliance, has caused confusion among law enforcement agencies, systemically chilled Plaintiffs’ interactions with federal law enforcement, and caused the Mesa County Sheriff’s Office to pull back from cooperation with federal law enforcement agencies,” the lawsuit says.



Article 74, created through bills passed in 2021 and this year, prohibits local law enforcement and government officials from sharing certain information with federal agents for the purpose of immigration enforcement. There are exceptions for active criminal investigations.
Earlier this summer, Mesa County Sheriff’s Deputy Alexander Zwinck pulled over a 19-year old college student from Utah, Caroline Dias Goncalves, for trailing a semitrailer too closely. Zwinck let Goncalves go with a warning, but told immigration officials about her presence in the county through a Signal group chat meant for drug enforcement operations. Goncalves, who is from Brazil and has applied for asylum, was then detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents for nearly two weeks.
Afterwards, Mesa County Sheriff Todd Rowell placed Zwinck on a three-week unpaid leave and Attorney General Phil Weiser filed a lawsuit against the deputy.
Rowell is a plaintiff in the county’s lawsuit against the state.
 










We will not stand by while our employees are targeted for doing their jobs.


– Mesa County Attorney Todd Starr




“The statute’s lack of clarity creates a significant risk, as we’ve already seen, of arbitrary enforcement, which could lead to substantial fines and legal challenges against our employees,” Mesa County Attorney Todd Starr said during a county commissioner meeting on Tuesday. “This action sends a clear message: We will not stand by while our employees are targeted for doing their jobs. This step is not just lawful, it’s necessary. It protects those who protect our community and ensures they can continue to work without fear of politically motivated litigation.”
The lawsuit alleges that Article 74 has compromised criminal investigations in Mesa County related to drug smuggling, child exploitation and sex crimes because it limits collaboration with local and federal law enforcement.
The county wants a federal judge to clarify that law enforcement and government employees violate Article 74 only if they disclose personal information for the “sole” purpose of helping with immigration enforcement, and that local law enforcement can inquire about someone’s immigration status for “reasonable and legitimate law enforcement purposes.”
Weiser and Gov. Jared Polis are named as defendants.
In a statement, Weiser spokesperson Lawrence Pacheco wrote that Colorado’s law is clear that state law enforcement does not do federal civil immigration enforcement.
“It’s unfortunate that Mesa County filed this lawsuit. The Department of Law has a responsibility to follow facts and defend and enforce state law. We’ll continue to take this duty seriously,” he wrote.

(Illustration by Tara Anand for Bolts)This article was originally published in Bolts, a nonprofit newsroom, as a collaboration between Bolts and the Investigative Reporting Lab at Yale.
It was an idyllic Saturday afternoon on Feb. 5, 2022, as Kambran Young drove down Appalachee Street near downtown Birmingham with his two brothers and three of their best friends. Residents of the city’s Kingston neighborhood were outside, blasting loud music and washing cars as the group cruised up and down the street where they spent a lot of their time—the street where Jenkins’ and Young’s dad has his car repair business, and where their grandmother lives.
Young, 19 at the time, was the free spirit of the group, always looking for the next adrenaline rush. Justin Jenkins, one of Young’s older brothers riding with him that afternoon, remembers Young seeming restless before announcing to the car that he was thinking about stealing a wad of cash he’d spotted on a parking lot attendant’s stand a couple blocks away. Jenkins immediately tried to lure his little brother away from trouble, suggesting they go back to the nearby recording studio their father had built for them, where they had recently started making music together.
Colby Cade, another of Young’s older brothers who was also in the car that day, scolded him for even thinking of taking the money. “Sit your ass down somewhere, bro,” Jenkins remembers Cade telling the younger kids in the car. “Y’all wanna take from other people? They work hard for this stuff.”

As Cade and Jenkins left their brother with the rest of the group, Jenkins remembers asking their friend Robert, who was now driving, not to take Young back to the lot where he’d spotted the cash. “Don’t take them where they wanna go.”
Less than an hour later, Robert called Jenkins to say there had been an emergency, telling him to rush to the hospital. Young and their 17-year-old friend, Chico Guest, had been shot. “Stop playing,” Jenkins remembers saying before he felt himself begin to cry.
Young and Guest had gone to the lot to try and take the money after all, despite the pushback from Young’s brothers. While the state alleged that both Young and Guest were armed, Young and Jenkins maintain that Young was not carrying a weapon, and prosecutors never presented evidence that he did. According to Young, Guest carried a pistol, as he usually did, which he kept hidden in his sweatshirt pocket as the teenagers approached the parking lot stand. The attendant, who spotted the pair as they got close, pulled out a gun of his own and shot Guest in the chest.
Young, who ran away as fast as he could after Guest fell to the ground, was shot four times, with bullets hitting Young’s back and leg. Guest never got back up.
When Jenkins got to the hospital after an angry, anxious drive, he started to mourn the loss of Guest, who felt like a brother. Then he started to brace himself for the possibility of also losing Young, who’s been more like a twin all his life. The two were born just three months apart, to the same father and different mothers. They’ve been best friends since, and even look enough alike that people used to confuse them, with matching braids and each with tattoos of their respective moms’ names.
Jenkins prayed: Please give him one more chance, I know he’ll change. Cade tried to comfort his brother, telling him, “Kam loves you too much, he’s not going to leave you.”
Young awoke two days later inside a hospital room with around 40 staples in his stomach, and surrounded by police officers. Barely able to move, Young was handcuffed to a wheelchair and transported to the Jefferson County Jail. As he came to, Young started replaying the events of the shooting, asking himself over and over, Was there anything I could have done to save Chico?
Young says he was still in tremendous physical pain as he waited for police to question him and wanted to get home to be with family. He still hadn’t seen Jenkins.
Then the interrogation started, with police asking Young, who was still recovering from multiple gunshot wounds, to tell them everything he could remember from that Saturday.
During the interrogation, a detective asked Young whether he was aware that he was being charged with his friend’s murder. Young says he was dumbfounded and didn’t know how to respond, so the detective repeated himself: Chico Guest’s murder, you are being charged with Chico Guest’s murder.
Prosecutions for killings they didn’t commit
Felony murder is a particularly American form of punishment. The idea—that if you commit a felony, and someone dies in the process of that crime, you can be charged with murder, even if someone else committed the killing—was likely inherited from English common law. However, the U.K. abolished the doctrine in the 1950s, following public unease over the execution of a 19-year-old Londoner for the murder of a policeman, who had been shot and killed by a 16-year-old accomplice during a robbery. (Another doctrine similar to felony murder reemerged in the U.K. in the 1980s, but in 2016 the Supreme Court significantly limited its scope.)
While other Commonwealth nations like Canada eventually abolished their versions of the felony murder doctrine, the charge became even more widespread in the U.S. under mass incarceration. Today, forty-eight states permit some version of the charge.
Alabama is one of 14 states where felony murder can be applied most broadly, allowing prosecutors to charge defendants with the death of an accomplice, even when the killing was committed by someone else. Felony murder, like other murder charges in the state, is punishable by up to life in prison or even the death penalty—as illustrated by the case of Nathaniel Woods, who was executed in 2020 for the murder of three Birmingham police officers who were shot by someone else.
Law enforcement officials who prosecute people for murder under the doctrine say it aims to hold people responsible for creating dangerous situations with potentially fatal outcomes.
But critics of felony murder say the charge undermines baseline tenets of criminal law—namely, that murder requires criminal intent, or mens rea (Latin for “guilty mind”).
“Basic criminal law is that intentional murder requires mens rea and actus rea—criminal intent and criminal act. You learn that in your first semester of criminal law,” said defense attorney Mark McDaniel, who formerly served as a special assistant attorney general in Alabama. “Where is that in felony murder? It’s not there, there’s zero intent.”
The seeming disconnect of prosecuting someone for murder over a killing they didn’t actually commit often sparks public outrage and confusion around felony murder cases, including in Alabama, where McDaniel says the charge is still commonly used by prosecutors.
Darnell Coates and Lonze Byrd, for instance, were charged with the murder of William Michael Thomas, who died from a heart attack after confronting the men while they were trying to steal catalytic converters and other scrap from his recycling business in Greensboro in 2019; Thomas, 60, punctured the tires on Coates’ car to try and prevent him from fleeing and fired a warning shot before he collapsed. In 2021, law enforcement in Mobile charged Jamon Merrida and Demarcus Longmire with the murder of their friend Calvin Horne Jr., after the three went to buy marijuana and Horne was shot and killed by a third party. In 2022, Casey White was charged with murder for the death of a corrections officer who had helped him escape the Lauderdale County jail, and who subsequently took her own life following a high-speed police chase.
Another infamous case in Alabama shows how felony murder can allow police to kill someone and pin the murder charge on someone else. In 2015, LaKeith Smith, then 15 years old, and four friends broke into some unoccupied homes to steal video games and other electronics when a neighbor called the police. While Smith ran into the woods, one of his friends, 16-year-old A’Donte Washington, was shot and killed by one of the responding officers after allegedly running toward them with a weapon. Police charged the rest of the four teens with felony murder and prosecuted them as adults. Smith, who is Black and was the youngest among them, was the only one who refused to accept a plea deal and took his case to trial, where an all-white jury convicted him of murder; a judge sentenced Smith to 65 years behind bars, which an appeals court later reduced to 30 years.
There is no full accounting of how many people have been sent to prison for felony murder and for how long. In Alabama, like many states, officials do not specifically track felony murder charges but record them simply as murder—making the charge on Young’s record indistinguishable from premeditated or first-degree murder charges, with the same range of potential penalties.
In 2022, Sarah Stillman, a staff writer at The New Yorker, began working with students and colleagues at the Investigative Reporting Lab at Yale to gauge the scope and impact of the punishment. That work led to the Felony Murder Reporting Project (of which I am a part), which between early 2022 and late 2023 collected and analyzed over 10,000 cases of people charged with felony murder, to create a public data hub for exploring how the charge is applied across the country.
The Lab’s analysis revealed that felony murder is disproportionately imposed on low-income defendants, young people and people of color.
In Alabama, defendants with felony murder charges skew especially young, according to state records obtained by the Lab. Between 2009 and 2017, people charged with felony murder in Alabama were nearly nine years younger on average than those charged with other crimes.
During the same time period, 83 percent of people charged with felony murder in Alabama were Black, even though the state population is only about 27 percent Black. That means a Black Alabaman is 13 times more likely to be charged with felony murder than their white counterpart.
Records compiled by the Lab also show that, between 2009 and 2017, almost 10 percent of all murder charges in Alabama, or 281 cases, were actually for felony murder. Of those 281 people, 70 percent were convicted, meaning nearly 200 people in Alabama are likely still serving time behind bars for murders that they didn’t actually commit.
Jenkins was shocked when his brother became one of them. “I just never got it,” he said. “I never understood it.”

‘I really don’t know how to take it’

Jenkins and Young liked Chico Guest right away, after the brothers met and started hanging out with him on Appalachee Street as teenagers. Young, the more outspoken and adventurous of the brothers, got along especially well with Guest. “He had this confidence about himself,” Young told me.
Guest is one of the many people Jenkins and Young have lost to gun violence since childhood—including Guest and three of their brothers. Jenkins was in fourth grade the first time he witnessed gunfire, when he saw his brother’s friend die in a drive-by shooting. “I was traumatized,” he said of the memory.
Jenkins told me that, in the northeast Birmingham neighborhood where he and Young grew up, people start carrying guns in their early teens as a matter of survival. Jefferson County, where Birmingham is located, has seen a record number of homicides in the past several years, though killings have recently started to fall below pre-pandemic levels (as they have in much the rest of the country).
Jenkins says Young was aware that Guest was carrying a pistol the day of the robbery, but didn’t register it as a serious threat or consider the possibility that it might actually be used, because guns were so routinely present. Looking back at Young and Guest now, over 3 years later, he sees their mindset at the time of the robbery as impulsive, shortsighted and careless—but not as violent.
  A growing body of research in criminal psychology is beginning to take this characteristic of the adolescent mind into account when assessing the culpability and sentencing of young people.

A growing body of research in criminal psychology is beginning to take this characteristic of the adolescent mind into account when assessing the culpability and sentencing of young people. Research shows that the prefrontal cortex of the brain, critical for impulse control and decision making, continues to develop well into the mid-20s.
Over the past two decades, the U.S. Supreme Court has abolished the death penalty for those under 18, banned life without parole sentences for non-homicidal juvenile crimes, and deemed it unconstitutional to automatically sentence juveniles convicted of homicide to life without parole. In recent years, a wave of states, including Massachusetts and Michigan, have also restricted life sentences for young adults up until age 21, blurring the bright line distinction for adulthood that the criminal legal system has traditionally set at age 18.
Some other states, like Pennsylvania, have also started to assess whether extreme sentences for felony murder, like life without parole, violate state and federal constitutional protections. In a high-profile case now before the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, critics argue these harsh sentences are disproportionate and fail to account for individual culpability, especially for young or minimally involved defendants.
As the law stands today in Alabama, prosecutors aren’t required to consider a defendant’s age, unless they’re under 14, or degree of direct involvement in a killing when deciding whether to charge them with murder.
Young spent over one year waiting to be indicted, and more than two years overall waiting for trial. At the start, he was bailed out by his dad and placed on house arrest, where he and Jenkins had time to process Guest’s death and Young’s criminal case together.
Jenkins visited Young at home nearly every day during the year he spent on house arrest. “We were talking about life, thinking about the things we wish we never did, wishing life had a rewind button,” Jenkins said.
Sometimes the brothers would visit friends or go to the studio when Young’s probation officer allowed it. “We rap about what’s going on and what we’ve been through,” Jenkins said. “We make pain music.”
They call one song that they wrote together their “Letter to Chico,” which currently has more than 130,000 views on YouTube:
“I remember the day my brother died, yeah I swear I cried. 
Holding all this shit inside, I swear it left me traumatized. 
Baby boy I miss you, Imma ride until I blow the tires.”
Young’s bail was revoked in 2023 when he missed a court date, which he says he didn’t know about because he hadn’t been notified of the hearing. He found out he had to go back to jail after his dad was told that Young had 21 days to turn himself in, or else his dad would lose his house, which had been posted as collateral to cover his bail. Young cried nearly every one of those 21 days, and turned himself in on the last morning he could.
Jenkins’s daughter was born just days after Young went back to jail. “I was trying to keep him out so he could see my baby,” Jenkins told me.
In the spring of 2024, Young’s attorney informed him that he’d negotiated a deal with prosecutors to drop the felony murder charge in exchange for him pleading guilty to manslaughter, a Class B felony punishable by up to 20 years in prison.
Young recoiled at the idea of pleading guilty to something he didn’t do, but worried that taking the case to trial would nevertheless result in him being convicted for murdering his friend.
On April 8, 2024, Young pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of Chico Guest, one of his closest friends, and was later sentenced to up to 15 years in prison, with the possibility of parole in 2028.
As we talked about the felony murder charge, and how it ultimately persuaded him to enter a guilty plea for a lesser charge, Young still seemed to be processing the sequence of events that led to his prison sentence. “I really don’t know how to take it, or explain how I feel,” Young told me.

Seeking law changes

Last year, as Young started serving his prison sentence inside Kilby Correctional Facility, advocates 15 miles away in Montgomery were lobbying for legislative changes to prevent felony murder charges in cases like his. House Bill 32, filed during the Alabama Legislature’s 2024 session by Chris England, a Democratic state representative from Tuscaloosa, would have narrowed the state’s felony murder law to exclude cases where the killing was committed by a third party—like when a cop or a store clerk kills someone’s accomplice during a robbery.
When discussing the legislation at an Alabama House committee hearing last year, England said, “What we’re trying to do is something where we don’t ensnare someone that shouldn’t be serving the range of punishment of a class A felony because of some unfortunate incident that occurs that they were not involved with, and that they didn’t intend to happen.”
Among the advocates who spoke in support of the bill at the committee hearing was Andre Washington, the father of A’Donte Washington, who was shot and killed by a police officer while committing a burglary, leading to the felony murder convictions of four of his friends, including LaKeith Smith, who remains in prison.
“This is the first in-person public statement I’ve ever made, and I’m doing this in support of HB 32,” Washington told lawmakers during the hearing. “My son lost his life, and now I’m having to sit and watch another son’s life be thrown away.” Brontina Smith, LaKeith’s mother, also testified at the hearing in support of the bill.
HB 32, however, stalled in the committee without a vote after three district attorneys spoke in opposition, including CJ Robinson, who prosecuted LaKeith Smith.
Months after he testified against HB 32, Robinson told me in a phone interview in late August 2024 that, despite his opposition to the reform bill, he was open to proposals for narrowing the application of felony murder. He explained that he disagreed with the bill’s suggested elimination of proximate cause—the idea that someone can be enough of an indirect cause for someone’s death to be treated as though they themselves directly committed the murder—saying a defendant in Smith’s position had “created that situation that ended up with a friend dying.”
But Robinson did seem to be reconsidering the fairness of the charge he prosecuted against Smith and his friends. “Old fashioned intentional murder shouldn’t carry the exact same range of punishment and class of felony as what Lakeith Smith did,” Robinson told me. “I don’t know if I would have this opinion if I hadn’t lived that case.”
Alabama lawmakers this year didn’t file any proposed legislation to reform how felony murder is prosecuted.
Young, who has spent the last year trying to adapt to his new life in prison, says he feels lucky to have a family who supports him; Jenkins and his mother still call him every day.
But incarceration doesn’t insulate him from the trauma that gun violence continues to inflict on his community back home. Last February, while he was still awaiting trial at the Jefferson County jail, he called his mom soon after seeing news of a murder near his neighborhood pop up on TV, only to have her confirm his worst fears: Colby Cade, one of his brothers, had been shot and killed.
Young, who had spoken to Cade earlier that day, remembers being speechless, how he could barely breathe and just cried. He spent the next eight days in his cell and was placed on suicide watch.
“We felt so bad for him that he wasn’t with us,” Jenkins told me. Young wasn’t able to grieve alongside his family.
Still, Jenkins lights up when he’s thinking about the future with Young. He says they dream of one day moving to New York together and making music.
When Jenkins looks back on that fateful day in February 2022, what strikes him is that every other guy in that car with him cruising down Appalachee Street is now either dead or incarcerated. “I’m the only one here,” he said.
Jenkins is beginning to release music again—a practice he had stopped since Young’s arrest, Cade’s death, and the birth of his daughter. Although he can see how difficult this period has been for his brother, Jenkins says he also feels proud of Young.
“He’s changed, he’s growing up,” Jenkins said. “He wants to do the right thing, and his conversations, the way he talks, he’s just totally different.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Illustration-for-Aug-10-2025-story-1024x695.jpg,,,2025-08-10 08:56:10.270035

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)It’s not as bad as it could’ve been: That’s the new bar for public health success in South Dakota.
The leader of the state Health Department, Melissa Magstadt, made that clear Thursday when she declared herself “so proud” of the state’s measles response.
In an opinion piece she wrote and sent to the media, Magstadt summarized the state’s efforts since measles cases surged earlier this year in other parts of the country and reached South Dakota in May.
Her staff identified at-risk counties, provided updated advice for health care providers, increased the state health lab’s testing capacity, notified over 400 potentially exposed people, helped concerned patients review their vaccination records, and conducted pop-up immunization clinics.
Results of SD’s special measles clinics: 14 vaccinations, including zero in seven of 11 locations

There were some missteps, too, which we at South Dakota Searchlight pointed out in a recent news story that might have motivated Magstadt’s piece.
In June, when the department announced a schedule of measles vaccination clinics in 11 cities, the announcement didn’t say whether the clinics would be free — an important bit of information to share when trying to avert the rapid spread of a disease. The department eventually told us it provides immunizations “at no cost when insurance isn’t an option.”
It took us weeks to learn the results of the clinics, after the department initially claimed that disclosing numbers would violate patient confidentiality. When we finally pried the data free, the likely reason for the secrecy was apparent. At seven of the 11 announced locations, nobody got vaccinated for measles on the days of the special clinics, while a total of 14 measles immunizations were administered at the other four locations.
Although those clinics were largely a bust, the department said its other efforts have helped to push the number of measles vaccinations in the state past 6,000 this year, which is about 1,200 more than the same time last year.
The department deserves credit for that, and for helping to stop the spread of measles at 12 known cases so far. Magstadt said the absence of any new cases during the past four weeks is evidence that the state “has done remarkably well.”
That’s as it should be. When an infectious disease threatens South Dakotans, we should expect no less of our Department of Health than to do its job. We should’ve expected more of the department before the crisis arrived, and we should expect more of it going forward.
Magstadt didn’t mention in her opinion piece that the state’s kindergarten measles vaccination rate tumbled from 97% to 90% during the past 10 years, while she and other public health officials failed to effectively counter the false and conspiratorial narratives about vaccine safety and efficacy that drove the decline. Nor did she mention the role of falling vaccination rates in the return of measles after the disease was eliminated in the United States 25 years ago.
Magstadt seems uninterested in asking what went wrong, choosing instead to proclaim victory amid a still-unfolding situation and insisting that South Dakota did “so well” at limiting the spread of measles “because we were ready.”
If scrambling to contain the predictable results of a decade-long drop in the vaccination rate is what passes for preparedness in South Dakota, maybe we need to set the bar for disease prevention a little higher.

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Devon Craig: A response to a commentary on Vermont wildlife .","Dear Editor,
It’s interesting that Brenna Galdenzi’s opinion piece starts off with a Walt Disneyesque description of animal behaviors. 
They are not humans and should not be treated as such. Every second of every day, a bear kills a deer, a coyote kills a woodchuck, a hawk kills a chipmunk. They don’t talk with each other. 
She notes that our history of hunting is not in tune with the times and that our traditions are no longer viable. I guess she forgets about the hunting, fishing and trapping communities self-regulating that everyone — herself included — benefits from. 
I am referencing the billions of dollars made available through taxation of which the hunting and fishing communities levied upon themselves have paid for untold millions of acres of lands for wildlife to live in — dollars in the amounts of which non-consumers of wildlife will never equal or exceed. But they, too, receive the benefits of our largess.
Those dollars have supported our country’s fish and wildlife departments for many decades, allowing the scientific results of wildlife biologists’ studies to benefit viable numbers of wild animals. To denigrate their professional efforts is to be totally out of touch with reality. 
Wildlife management is a work in progress. With human influence in our land becoming greater every day, it is now, more than ever, the time to use science to solve problems — not simple emotions.

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)As more hospitals have gobbled up private physician practices, costs for childbirth and other services have gone up, according to a new study.
Since the early aughts, the share of physicians in the United States working for hospitals has nearly doubled, according to the study published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, a nonprofit research organization.
And as fewer doctors work in physician-owned practices, patients or their insurers end up paying more, the study’s authors found.
For example: Two years after a hospital buys an OB-GYN practice, prices for labor and delivery jump an average of $475 and physician prices rise by $502, according to the study. Researchers focused on births, which are the most common reason for hospital admission among people with private insurance.
This rapid acquisition by hospitals is reshaping a U.S. industry once dominated by tens of thousands of small, physician-owned practices.
Only about 42% of U.S. physicians work in a physician-owned private practice, according to the most recent survey data from the American Medical Association. Nearly 47% work for hospitals, a sharp rise over the past several years. Most emergency room physicians are now employed by hospital systems or by private equity-owned staffing groups.
The new research offers further evidence for how hospital acquisitions of private practices “can result in anticompetitive price increases,” said Matthew Grennan, one of the study’s authors and an associate professor of economics at Emory University, in a news release.
“As a result, I think economists and others in the antitrust community are likely to give more careful consideration to these potential sources of harm,” he said.
Medical debt is a leading cause of bankruptcy in the United States, with about 14 million Americans owing more than $1,000 in medical debt, according to research nonprofit KFF.
These post-merger price increases are driven by reduced competition, Grennan and his fellow researchers found. Yet there’s been little effort by federal or state regulators to halt hospital mergers that could lead to higher prices for consumers.
But states have taken some steps toward lowering medical costs in recent years.
Bipartisan groups of lawmakers in more than a dozen states have addressed so-called “facility fees,” which are charges that some hospitals tack on for patient visits to hospital-owned physician offices.
This year in Oklahoma, Republican lawmakers passed a bill requiring hospitals to make the cost of many of their services more transparent to patients so they’re aware of the costs. Providers can face penalties for noncompliance. A similar Oklahoma law authored by Democrats and passed last year requires debt collectors to submit evidence of a hospital’s compliance with price transparency rules before filing to collect on medical debts from patients.
Some states have capped the rates hospitals or physicians can charge. Colorado sets provider and hospitals rates based on a specific formula if insurance plans aren’t able to lower peoples’ premiums to a certain level, while Montana and Oregon limited the amount hospitals and other providers can charge for their state employee health plan.

,Mississippi Today,2025-08-10 11:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,What if the government gave you public money to spend at Disneyland?,Bobby Harrison,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/08/10/public-money-school-choice-disney/,"Column: Would you like some public funds to take your family on vacation to Disneyland? Under the logic of some politicians who support ""school choice,"" it's not out of the realm of possibility.","A new grassroots movement is developing that would allow public money to follow what we’ll call the “recreator,” or a person who participates in recreational activity.
It makes sense. Why should a person be forced to provide his or her hard-earned money to support local and state park systems if they are not using them?
Would you like to take your kids to Disneyland, but you’re worried about how much it will cost your family? That’s OK, the government can give you back some of the tax money you paid to keep your town’s public parks open and subsidize your trip. You don’t use those local parks much anyways, and you could argue you’d personally get more out of the Disney trip.
Or, instead of paying for the parks with your tax money, take it to help purchase a gym membership or in-home exercise equipment — maybe even a backyard swing set. Instead of paying for public libraries, your tax funds could be used to purchase the books you want to read.
These ideas, of course, should read as extremely unserious. As much as we may like to pay lower taxes or have the public subsidize our vacations and lifestyle habits, most would agree a family trip to Disneyland or these other expenses would be an egregious use of money intended to improve our communities.
But these exact ideas are being increasingly touted by state leaders as part of the argument used by those supporting vouchers or even tax credits to provide public funds to allow students to attend private schools.
They argue that the tax dollars intended to boost public school should instead be spent by the parents of the students and not the government. After all, it’s their money. The parents of students should be able to use those funds to educate their children anyway they see fit.
To go a step further, the “school choice supporters,” as they call themselves, also contend that there should be no accountability for the schools or other entities receiving those education dollars. Trust in the parents is apparently the only accountability that the government needs.
Never mind the wild possible scenarios that could play out. Let’s say parents get mad because their child’s grades are slipping. The parents with a voucher to a private school tell the administrators they are transferring little Johnnie unless little Johnnie makes certain grades. The easy solution for the school administrators could be to give little Johnnie that grade demanded by the parents so that the school can continue to collect the public education dollars.
This “parents know best” argument neglects the important fact that there are many taxpayers who are paying to support the public schools who have no children. Taking this argument to the extreme: perhaps people who do not have school-age children should be able to keep their funds rather than funding schools where they have no personal connection.
That counter argument, of course, is also ridiculous and ignores the premise that was established at our nation’s founding. Americans don’t pay taxes for individual purposes. They pay taxes for the common or societal good.
The primary goal of taxes is to ensure a better school system not just for one student, but for the general public.
The goal of taxes is not to provide a good park in your neighborhood or a smoothly paved road in front of your own house — though that does seem to be the goal of some Mississippi lawmakers recently — but to provide good, safe public spaces and an adequate transportation system for all of us.
Granted, those goals are not always achieved, especially in many communities across Mississippi. But if there is no tax money to pay for public schools, public parks, public libraries, public law enforcement, we all suffer. Better public schools in particular can only build a better community, a better economy and a better state.
People want to live in areas where there are good schools, good parks, good libraries, good transportation systems and other public services.
If we pull tax revenue out of the coffers they were intended to support, what are we left with? It’s worth considering what our public school system — and our communities in the present and future — would look like with even fewer public resources.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/08103448/AP24108573586959.jpg,,,2025-08-10 07:56:12.200082

Listen to the full interview.
WATERBURY— Nick Deml, Vermont’s outgoing corrections commissioner, wants the public to know that more and more is being expected of Vermont’s prisons, both from federal immigration authorities and the state’s human services landscape. 
“Today, the expectation is that the corrections agency does everything,” he told VTDigger in a wide-ranging interview this week. “That’s a good thing for the most part, but we’re expected to provide education, we’re expected to provide substance use treatment, we’re expected to provide the community standard of health care.” 
Deml will will step down Aug. 15 after almost four years leading Vermont’s prison system

Former Burlington Police Department Chief Jon Murad will take the reins, overseeing the state’s six detention facilities, more than 900 employees and almost 1,600 incarcerated individuals.  
In an interview with VTDigger, Deml discussed the learning curve inherent in taking over the department as an outsider without previous prison experience. He detailed the challenges facing corrections, like improving working conditions in order to retain security staff and working with a population of incarcerated individuals in need of more care than they were prior to the Covid-19 pandemic. 
Deml also addressed some of the more public struggles the Department of Corrections has faced, from replacing the state’s ailing women’s prison, Chittenden Regional Correctional Facility in South Burlington, to the increasing burden of working with federal immigration authorities. 
After leaving the department, Deml said he plans to begin consulting on projects related to corrections as well as his past work in national security. He did not rule out a return to government work, but did swat away rumors of a run for office. 

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
VTDigger: Why did you take this job?
Nick Deml: It’s an interesting question, because when I took the job — before and even since — people say ‘this has got to be the hardest job in state government,’ or maybe the Department for Children and Families Commissioner, which I actually think is probably harder.
It can be kind of thankless. There’s a couple of things that motivated me to do the job. One, I wanted to work in Vermont. (Two), I wanted to stay in government and public service, and I think you’d be hard pressed to find another role in Vermont that can have the impact that you can have as the commissioner of Corrections. The number of lives you touch, either people in your custody, people in the community that you’re serving. 
VTD: What do you think you didn’t understand about the job going in? 
ND: I didn’t come from a corrections background, and so there was certainly a learning curve on the front end, as there would be with any job, particularly a job of this scope and scale. But I think I underappreciated the complexity of corrections. I think initially I didn’t understand the scale or scope of the workforce crisis, the staffing crisis that we were experiencing. 
And then I think we all were on a learning curve, but by myself chiefly among us, to understand how much we changed during the pandemic, and particularly looking at our incarcerated population. I think we expected health trends to rebound and we’d go back to kind of 2019 levels of everything. And that was not the case. In fact, coming out of the pandemic, the folks that were coming into our system in particular were much sicker than they were in 2019, and that hasn’t abated. 
VTD: Do you think being an outsider made it more challenging to deal with the rank and file and have some of those workforce conversations with the union?
ND: I don’t think it made it harder to talk to our folks on the line. What I heard when I went out, especially initially, for those first, you know, year, 18 months, every time I went to a facility and met with folks, they would say, ‘It’s been a long time since we’ve seen a commissioner. I’ve not met a commissioner before.’ 
That opportunity to connect with them at their worksite, where they’re working, where they’re doing the mission, I think that is what enabled me to connect with our workforce really closely. And I think that wouldn’t matter if I was a career corrections officer or somebody off the street. You need to find ways to connect to those folks, and they’re yearning for that. They’re the folks on the ground doing the work every day, and we drifted a little bit, I think, from them. And so our mission over the last four years was really to build back that trust with our workforce, show them that we care. And I think we did that.
As it relates to the union, I think it cuts both ways. On the one hand, I don’t think they really knew what to do with me, because I wasn’t the commissioner they were used to. And on the other hand, I think they didn’t give — I don’t know, ‘respect’ is too strong of a word — but I don’t think that they were willing to engage me the way they would have somebody they’d known for a long time.
VTD: The workforce crisis has gotten better but hasn’t completely abated. There’s still mandatory overtime. (Officers are sometimes required to work 16-hour shifts.) What has worked, and what hasn’t worked?
ND: Vermont has a workforce crisis writ large. We’re an aging state. We have a decreasing number of working-age adults, and so there’s just fewer and fewer people available to do the work. 
Then you bring that down to corrections. Corrections nationally is having this staffing crisis pretty much everywhere in the country. We were at a high vacancy rate in our security ranks of 32% vacant. Today, some of the corrections agencies around the country are over 50%. 
We’re down now to 15%, and that’s great, but there’s mandatory overtime. The work-life balance isn’t there yet. Folks are stressed, it’s a tough job on its best day, and then you add the extra hours in, and it becomes very, very difficult. 
So what’s worked? I mean, we took the opportunity early in my tenure, but I think about a year into my tenure, to really go out and do focus groups, do surveying, meet with staff in the facilities to talk about, what are the pain points for them? Why would you continue working here? Why would you consider leaving? Instead of trying to decipher what we thought the problems were, we got really salient, really fairly consistent results across the entire system. And that was, ‘I’m not getting enough time away from the facilities. Work life balance isn’t there. The facilities are hard places to work. I’m not getting the supervision I’m seeking.’ 
What we didn’t hear is, ‘I don’t get paid enough.’ So it’s really for me, when we started to diagnose the workforce challenges, it’s about the experience of staff working in the system, and if we can improve that experience, we’re more likely to keep folks. Now, we did increase pay. We put more than $30 million into additional compensation over the last three years for correctional staff. We’ve added other benefits. We have a great partnership with the Community College of Vermont providing free community college education to staff. Until we can materially change the experience of a correctional officer on a day-to-day basis, going to work and having work-life balance, we’re going to continue to suffer here. 
VTD: To change staff’s experience, I imagine you need to change the facilities themselves — what they look like. There’s been an ongoing struggle to build a new women’s prison. Are we as a state still capable of building a new human services property, of siting a new facility?
ND: I mean, I hope so. At the end of the day, one of the primary functions of a state government is to provide human services. If we are going to continue to face very difficult situations trying to build new human services facilities, then the state won’t be able to deliver on its mandate. 
But I do think there’s hope. I think that we will build a new women’s prison. I think it will be a significantly different experience at that facility than hopefully any facility in the country, but certainly any facility that Vermont has ever had. 
But we’re not going to replace all the men’s facilities, certainly not in the next short period of time. I think it’ll be decades before we do that. So what do we do with the facilities we have? And that’s where we’ve tried to focus in, to improve the staff experience, by creating spaces that are dedicated to staff so they can decompress, recoup, take breaks. We’ve tried to change paint schemes and things like that just to soften the facilities. And we advocated very strongly for HVAC systems for our correctional facilities. So we’re on a multi-year project to put air conditioning throughout the system. 
VTD: You’ve described the communication breakdown or a stalemate with the town of Essex in trying to build a new women’s prison. What can change in that process? Does the state need to throw its weight around more? How does this get done? 
ND: I think Vermont as a community really leans into collaboration and partnership, and so I think that’s the space where I hope we can make the most ground up.
I understand folks don’t want the concept of a prison in their backyard, and I appreciate that. And yet, I think if you talk to the neighbors around the Chittenden facility, the current women’s facility in Vermont, they would say, ‘We like having them as our neighbors.’ I know that because we’ve talked to them, and that’s what they say. The police chief, the fire chief, local businesses have appreciated that facility being there. We’ve been good neighbors to them. They’ve been good neighbors to us. And it is part of our community, whether people want to acknowledge that or not.
I think the situation in Essex will get better. We’re trying to build a complicated human services facility in a community that hasn’t had that in the past, and so, you know, they’re going through iterations too, and there’s going to be some growing pains. But I have confidence that the town leadership will continue to advance this project. We don’t want to get to a place where the state is trying to exert control, because that’s not going to get us the best outcomes. 
VTD: Compared to commissioners past, you’ve been a more ubiquitous face. People see you on the news. Your department has taken a different media strategy than others. What’s the thinking behind that approach? 
ND: I’m a firm believer in transparent government. We’re here to serve our communities, and to do that effectively, communities need to see us and what we’re doing.
I do think we’ve really benefited from transparency. It’s helped us to re-establish credibility where it was lost. It’s helped us to elevate the work. I mean, we have almost 1,000 staff in the Department of Corrections, and they’re public servants. They’re doing really hard work every day. And I think in general, people either don’t think about it or don’t respect the profession. And I wanted to change that as part of my work here.
VTD: Do you want to run for political office?
ND: I’ve been getting this question a lot lately. I have no interest in running for office. You know, the interesting thing about that, I mean, there’s nothing about running for office that is appealing to me. But doing these jobs, having the opportunity to serve the public and being able to do the work is what’s appealing. And so, you strip the politics away from it, the government work is, I think, the important part.
VTD: It seems like in the last couple of years, the governor and his team have pushed for what might be labeled ‘tougher on crime’ policies (like a public safety package in 2025 and new crimes targeting drugs and retail theft in 2024). Your department has pushed for more progressive approaches to problems like substance use. Do you feel like you’ve been working at cross purposes?
ND: I mean, I don’t think so. You’re right, the corrections agency doesn’t get to decide who comes to us. So our job, our mandate, is to receive whoever is sent there and take care of them as best we can. So that’s care, food service, health. And helping folks go back to the community to be successful. 
And while we’re doing that, certainly I think the communities that I’ve heard from are really struggling to adapt to the substance use crisis that’s been kind of plaguing Vermont over the last several years. These kind of low-level repeat crimes over and over again — what do you do with somebody like that? And so that public policy debate has been going on, but it’s really outside the scope of the department. Our job is to take care of the folks when they come to us, and I think we’ve done a good job with that. 
We see population changes over time. I think we’re on a bit of an upswing right now, and I don’t exactly know what the cause of that is, but our job is to try to figure out, how do we provide for these folks in our custody as best we can for the period they’re with us. 
VTD: At the beginning of your tenure, there was a string of deaths, particularly at Southern State, a rate of deaths that data would indicate outpaces the national average. With that, there’s been a lot of attention put on the health services provided in Vermont’s prisons and the various contractors that provide those services. Is prison health care broken, and what can make it better?
ND: Yeah, I think prison health care is definitely in a tough spot. I hope it’s not broken, because I do think that there are ways that it can improve. 
States are in a difficult place. There’s kind of three general models for this. You have a private, contracted health service, that’s what we do in Vermont. You have an in-state, in-government service that’s provided. That would be like if the Department of Corrections hired nurses, doctors, and they would be department staff. Vermont used that model about 20 years ago. And then a third, you have a partnership with a hospital system in your state. Often those are tied to universities, but not always. 
A state like Vermont, I think, suffers additionally from its size, in that we can’t create economies of scale in the way that a state like Texas can, for example. So Texas has its own hospital system within the correction system, massive multiple actual physical hospitals that they can utilize. They’re all corrections patients. I mean, we couldn’t afford something like that here. 
And that’s the model that we used 20 years ago. I wasn’t in the space 20 years ago, but talking to colleagues who were, including the defender general and others, they would say that wasn’t better than what we have now. 
VTD: Do you think an improved system would have prevented some of these deaths?
ND: I think it’s pretty difficult to say. 
We looked at each individual death that occurred in our system in the last four years. We did that. There’s also multiple other investigations that take place under state law. And then we also tried to look at trending analysis. 
Our numbers are pretty small, so it’s hard to extrapolate trends out of the small numbers. But there weren’t things that were immediately apparent that were major consistencies between the deaths. That’s tough for us, because we want to solve the issue, but if there isn’t a consistent issue to solve, it makes it more difficult.
I’ve been happy — happy may not the right word — but happy that the deaths by suicide numbers have definitely gone down. That’s a space where I do think there’s different ways for us to intervene and try to pick up on signs earlier, do everything that we can to prevent that outcome from happening. And I think we’ve taken steps to do that, and hopefully that continues.
That leaves us with folks who are dying of some type of medical issue or substance use, and those are more difficult to manage and intervene in. That’s, I think, where we want to focus.
VTD: What are the biggest challenges facing your successor?
ND: He’s going to continue to have to grapple with the workforce challenge. That’s the biggest existential threat to the success of corrections agencies across the country.
He’s going to have a population that is continuing to age, continuing to present with very complicated medical issues. And you know, in Vermont, we have a unified system, so we have the sentenced population and the detained population. That detained population is presenting to us much sicker than they ever have in our history. And that’s really challenging. 
If you get somebody on a Friday night brought in by law enforcement, and an hour later they’re overdosing and need to go to an emergency room, that puts a corrections system in a really complicated place.
VTD: Have you seen eye-to-eye with Gov. Phil Scott on the department’s work with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and border patrol?
ND: That is a really complicated issue
Vermont’s always had a relationship with ICE, or at least for a long time. Historically, it was folks who were coming across the border allegedly without authorization to do so, and they were detained by border patrol, brought to us temporarily because there’s no other detention space in the state, and then they’d be moved on and adjudicated through whatever federal immigration process existed. 
That’s changed a little bit, as we testified to recently. There’s folks being brought from other states and other spaces. It’s not just those folks who are doing the illegal border crossings. We’re just at the beginning of unpacking what this means.
But certainly I see eye-to-eye with the governor on — our obligation is to help people that are coming to our system. And I can affirm to the governor that if somebody comes to our correctional system, they will have access to the courts, they will have access to health care, they will have access to food, and we will try to provide them with any of the needs that they have in our system. 
VTD: Did any of these challenges or frustrations about collaborating with federal immigration authorities influence your decision to leave the department?
ND: No. Certainly there’s been a lot more work with ICE in the last six months. But no, my decision predated that and I was pretty confident that this was roughly the timeline I was going to be on when I was going to leave.
VTD: Was it your decision to leave?
ND: Yeah.
VTD: What are you most proud of from these years?
ND: Philosophically, we reoriented this department. Our goal, and hopefully we’ve accomplished this, was to reorient this department to the people it’s supposed to be serving. So on the one side, that’s our staff. They deserve to have a department that’s invested in them, who care about them, who want them to have meaningful careers with lots of impact, mission focused, and we know that this job extends beyond the walls of our facilities, and we need to take care of them outside of there, too. These are really, really tough jobs, 
And we have people in our care and custody that are counting on us to keep them safe, keep them fed and healthy, and take care of medical issues for them. And we, I think, reoriented the department to that work as well. In particular on the health side. That was the greatest body of work where we could make a huge impact and continue to improve on that system. 
And so we redesigned our health system. We’re about to onboard our first ever manager over nutrition to really target, How do we improve people’s health by giving them good food? Can we locally source food? Can we grow our own food so that it is the best food available for the population? I mean, just a year or so ago, we went to fluid milk across our system in partnership with the Agriculture Agency here in Vermont, and we’re using local Vermont and upstate New York milk to provide to our population. 
It’s a basic premise, but if folks are healthier when they leave, they’re more likely to be successful when they go to the community. And so it’s good for public safety, it’s good for the state and it’s just simply the right thing to do. 
VTD: What do people not understand about the Department of Corrections? And what do people maybe even within the Vermont Agency of Human Services not understand about the Department of Corrections? 
ND: One thing that we’ve been trying to highlight to folks is — as other systems across the state, across the country aren’t able to serve folks, as we have a lack of available medical care for folks, or mental health care, substance use treatment — what happens is those folks all end up kind of at the end of the line. The end of the line is either they’re unhoused, they’re in an emergency department, or they’re in a correctional facility, and often they’re cycling between the three.
I think the other thing, though, particularly in Vermont, but other places too, more and more is expected of the corrections system. Thirty years ago, largely the expectation was that somebody would be incarcerated for a period of time. You’d keep them safe, you’d stop them from fighting, and then you’d provide health care and food service and those things. And then when they got out, they got out.
Today, the expectation is that the corrections agency does everything for that person. And I think that’s a good thing for the most part, but we’re expected to provide education, we’re expected to provide substance use treatment, we’re expected to provide the community standard of health care. And all of that is good, but more and more is layered on top of the corrections agency as the one-stop-shop that can do all of that work while we have a staffing crisis, while there’s pressure for us to close facilities and decarcerate, and new resources aren’t added in. 
Frankly, corrections agencies can’t be good at everything and shouldn’t be good at everything. Our approach to that was to turn to community partners and try to bring more folks into our facilities to help. But I do think that that is kind of an untenable position that corrections agencies are being put in, and particularly as other community support systems collapse or recede from their ability to provide services.

(Photo courtesy of Justine Wilson)When Siri Fiske founded the Mysa Microschool in Washington, D.C., in 2016, there wasn’t a widely accepted term for her small, one-room schoolhouse model.
Now, the school is referred to on its website as one of the first microschools in the nation, and Fiske has seen a growing microschool movement since the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the five years since remote schooling amid pandemic-era lockdowns, microschools and homeschooling have emerged as increasingly popular alternatives to traditional public and private models. Smaller class sizes, individualized classrooms and lack of standardization are an appeal to parents, Fiske said.
“There’s this idea that people who open microschools are doing it for cultish or religious reasons, and there’s a misconception that all are like that,” Fiske said. “I’ve seen my students graduate into top colleges. There’s many ways to achieve academic success.”
Some education experts, however, have expressed concern about the growing movement. They question whether microschools are properly regulated and being held accountable, and whether they’ll pull dollars out of the public education system.
There is no federal definition of a microschool, and with the Trump administration’s plans to shutter the U.S. Department of Education, the onus is on states to figure them out.










Schools calling themselves microschools today are not what I would’ve called one back then. But I think that’s OK. It’s evolving.


–  Siri Fiske, founder and head of Mysa School


In some states, microschools face a bind: If they operate as private schools, they’re required to meet facility, staffing and curricular standards that are often cost-prohibitive for schools their size. If they operate under homeschool laws, they face oversight, assessment mandates and reporting requirements that aren’t designed for multifamily or educator-led models.
Some states, including Georgia, Tennessee and Texas, have passed “Learning Rights Protection Acts” to codify microschools’ right to operate.
In Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts and Oregon, learning pods and microschools often face child care or private school licensing requirements if they involve multiple families, hire instructors or provide compensation for child care.
“Schools calling themselves microschools today are not what I would’ve called one back then. But I think that’s OK. It’s evolving,” Fiske said.
She pointed to the national school choice movement — and states such as West Virginia — for helping the microschool movement flourish.
In 2022, West Virginia became one of the few states to define a microschool, distinctly separating it from a private school, homeschool or learning pod.
Those classifications, and how these schools are funded and regulated, affect everything from whether a school must hire certified teachers to how it ensures student safety or civil rights protections. And with more public dollars flowing to private or hybrid learning options through vouchers and education savings accounts — to the detriment of public school funding, some argue — states will need to define these schools and their place in the ecosystem.
States will have to fill the gaps, said Weadé James, senior director of K-12 education policy with the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning policy think tank.
“Accountability can vary wildly. Some microschools aren’t required to have certified teachers, conduct annual assessments, or even guarantee civil rights protections,” said James. “If public voucher dollars are going to a microschool, there has to be some level of oversight and accountability.”
Many microschools aren’t accredited
Microschools defy easy classification, and many advocates argue that’s by design. Don Soifer, CEO of the National Microschooling Center, an industry group, cautions lawmakers against rushing to impose fixed legal definitions.
“Innovation is happening too fast. The moment you define it in law, it becomes obsolete,” Soifer said.
New federal school voucher program poses a quandary for states: Opt in or opt out?

A 2024 sector analysis by the National Microschooling Center — one of the only sources of national data on the topic — found that many schools are operating outside traditional education principles.
In a survey of 400 microschools across 41 states, more than 60% of founders reported they were not currently licensed educators. Eighty-four percent reported their schools were not accredited. Among prospective founders, 48% are licensed educators (though only 14% currently work in public schools), 32% come from non-education fields, and 23% are parents building schools for their own children.
Most microschools (55%) operate under homeschool laws, while others function as private schools (37%), charters (6%) or fall into unique state categories (3%), according to the analysis.
“So, you can be a private or homeschool microschool program, where you aren’t required to provide students with certified teachers, or you aren’t required to conduct annual assessments,” James said.
Often described as “homeschool hybrids” or “small-scale learning communities,” microschools often serve around 16 students or fewer, and tend to cater to families with average or above-average incomes in their area. In some states, microschools have been authorized to receive public funds through voucher programs.
Some critics note that, like private schools, microschools may charge tuition, potentially excluding lower-income families and contributing to educational disparities.
These schools often operate in commercial spaces (41%), private residences (28%) or houses of worship (25%), according to the National Microschooling Center. The center also found the movement is diversifying: 37% of prospective founders are people of color, compared with 27% of current operators.
Because building and zoning codes vary from state to state and locality to locality, many operators may be unaware of the extra costs to meet school codes standards. Fiske recalls difficulties in expanding from Washington, D.C., to Vermont, which has stricter laws on water fountain requirements.
“Most people in the U.S. starting a microschool are doing it under the radar because the regulations to open a licensed school are so intense,” Fiske said. For the new school, she recalled, “it took us forever, and we had to install ADA-compliant toilets and water fountains for just 10 kids in Vermont.”
‘Microschooling is not one thing’
Microschools also operate in a legal gray zone, often outside the traditional K-12 system and subject to a patchwork of state and local policies that can either support or constrain their growth.
Growth has accelerated in conservative-leaning states with robust school choice programs, such as Arizona and Florida. Other states, such as Maryland, New York and North Dakota, have more restrictive homeschool or private school laws.
“Microschooling is not one thing. These schools look different in every state, and the policy frameworks around them vary wildly,” said Soifer, of the National Microschooling Center.
What is classified as a microschool can vary from “10 kids in a basement in Kentucky” to a 200-kid schoolhouse elsewhere.

Fiske said states need to create a way for operators and parents to know what to expect in a certain state, and help willing operators get the education and business acumen they need to run the schools successfully.
“But if you look at who is starting microschools in the U.S., it’s a lot of millennial parents who may not have any teacher training but wanted to create a learning environment for their children and others in the local community,” said Fiske. “And without efforts by the state to provide some incentives to earn accreditation and information as both a school and a small business, a few of these will find themselves going under.”
Seeking choices
After two decades working in conventional schools in the United States and around the world — including in Brazil, Egypt and Qatar — Justine Wilson turned down a high-paying leadership role at a prestigious private school. Instead, in 2023 she opened Curious and Kind Education, a two-day-a-week microschool in Sarasota, Florida, built around trust, nature-based learning and self-directed play.
Enrollment at Curious and Kind is mostly driven by word of mouth, she said. The program now has a waitlist. And Wilson has seen her enrollment grow from 18 students in her first year to roughly 100 students for the upcoming school year.
“The number of 5-year-olds on my waitlist is shocking,” she said, “and then I realized they’re COVID babies and their parents have really been driving this search for alternative schooling since the pandemic.”
James, of the Center for American Progress, questions whether microschools generally match the quality of traditional public schools, which still educate more than 80% of schoolchildren. She says families may be under the assumption that school choice options equate to better quality.
“We have created an illusion of choice to be quality, and I think a lot of families are seeking various choice options because they associate that with quality. But that doesn’t necessarily mean that where those students are going is any better than where they left,” she said.
“We need to take a closer look at what we are presenting to families,” James said. “It’s not just about having options and having a choice. It’s about having quality choice options.”
That quality, Soifer said, is what microschools are trying to achieve.
“Microschools do very well on the left, on the right … at the top end of the economy and at the fragile end of the income spectrum,” he said. “It’s really a matter of the new economy and a new way of thinking about education.”

This wasn’t just a technical decision. This was a political decision — and a moral one.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Rep. Rebecca Holcombe: Why does Gov. Phil Scott want to give DOGE your grocery list?.","This commentary is by Rebecca Holcombe, of Norwich. She is a Vermont state representative for Windsor-Orange 2.


On March 20, the Trump administration issued an executive order directing all federal agencies to break down “information silos” and gain “unfettered access” to data from every state program funded by the federal government. 
This includes a terrifying array of data: your psychiatric and health records, detailed financial data, photos, and more, all to be consolidated into a single massive federal surveillance database.
Then, last month, the Trump administration ordered states to turn over sensitive personal and financial data from Americans who have used SNAP, a food assistance program, in the past five years, including during the Covid-19 pandemic. In response, 21 states and Washington, D.C., sued the U.S. Department of Agriculture, seeking to block the order.
Vermont was not one of those states.
Instead of joining those leaders who are standing up for their residents, Gov. Phil Scott handed over the data — without the consent of affected Vermonters. No press release. No consultation. Just quiet compliance.
Let’s be clear: This is not abstract. 
According to Vermont Public, these records include “names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, and home addresses of all members of any household in Vermont that received SNAP benefits in the past five years.” The Scott administration even plans to share your specific food purchases. 
At least 1 in 5 Vermont households is affected. Many of them are working families, children, U.S.-born children of immigrants and people who lost jobs during the pandemic. 
This wasn’t just a technical decision. This was a political decision — and a moral one.
Other leaders said no. 
Gov. Andy Beshear of Kentucky called the order what it is: unlawful. California’s Attorney General Rob Bonta called it “a bait-and-switch of the worst kind.” As he put it, “SNAP recipients provided this information to get help feeding their families — not to be entered into a government surveillance database or be used as targets in the president’s inhumane immigration agenda.”
Why didn’t Scott do the same? Why didn’t he stand with other states to fight back? Why didn’t he give Vermont’s own attorney general, Charity Clark, a chance to resist in court? As Clark told Vermont Public, “(The Scott administration is) approaching this in a way that prevents me from being able to join a lawsuit.”
This is not how Vermonters expect our government to behave. Data collected to ensure that Vermont children do not go hungry is now being used to fuel a federal surveillance regime. It is a betrayal of consent, a violation of trust, and a direct contradiction of Vermont’s proud tradition of protecting privacy and resisting federal overreach.
This isn’t about “waste, fraud and abuse.” In 2024, Vermont had the fifth-lowest SNAP payment error of any state — a level even the Trump administration deems acceptable. The federal government explicitly stated that Vermont does not need corrective action on SNAP. So if they are demanding our personal information, it’s not to solve a problem with SNAP. It’s to serve a different agenda.
And yes, there’s an obvious and immediate threat: immigration enforcement. USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins, who requested the data from Vermont, has publicly called for “mass deportations” and “no amnesty under any circumstances.” The fear is not hypothetical. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is already using data-mined insurance claims as a “deportation tool.”
Now, thanks to Scott, ICE and other federal agencies may have access to the updated addresses and immigration statuses of tens of thousands of Vermont residents. Vermont did not send the National Guard to round people up, but we did tell the federal government where to find them.
Even federal technologists have warned against what’s happening. In a public resignation letter, 21 staffers from the Department of Government Efficiency wrote:
“We will not use our skills as technologists to compromise core government systems, jeopardize Americans’ sensitive data, or dismantle critical public services.”
But that’s exactly what Scott enabled. Once this data has been handed over, it cannot be taken back.
The people of Vermont deserve answers. We deserve to know what was shared, with whom and why. We deserve to know why our state’s leadership broke ranks with other governors who chose to defend their residents. We deserve to know how the Scott administration will protect the people who are now at risk: neighbors, children and families whose only “crime” was asking for help to eat.
Vermonters do not believe in big government surveillance. We do not believe in handing ICE a search engine to find our friends. We certainly do not believe helping feed your kids should cost you your privacy.

CHARLES, Illinois — If Gov. Greg Abbott is determined to pass a gerrymandered congressional map, Texas Democrats know he has the votes and the power to eventually get his way. But for the dozens of Democrats who left the state this week in protest of the map, it’s not just about winning — it’s […]","Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin speaks during a news conference surrounded by members of the Texas House Democratic Caucus at Painters District Council 30 in Aurora, Illinois, on Aug. 5, 2025. (Jamie Kelter Davis for The Texas Tribune)ST. CHARLES, Illinois — If Gov. Greg Abbott is determined to pass a gerrymandered congressional map, Texas Democrats know he has the votes and the power to eventually get his way.
But for the dozens of Democrats who left the state this week in protest of the map, it’s not just about winning — it’s about fighting.
Away from their families and regular jobs, Texas Democrats, most of whom are hunkered down in a suburb about an hour west of Chicago, are facing $500-per-day fines, civil arrest warrants and threats from Republican state leaders to remove them from office.
Now six days into the walkout, they plan to stay away until at least the end of the special session on Aug. 19. When they return, they face the possibility of being stripped of their leadership positions and even further marginalized in a chamber where they are already outnumbered. And no matter how long they stay away, Abbott can just call another special session to pass the map.
But it will all be worth it, they say, if they can lay the groundwork for a national fight over redistricting and ensure enough voters across the country understand what they frame as an attempt by President Donald Trump to stack the deck in the midterm election next year.
“It takes an act of defiance like this to wake up the country and let them know that our democracy is being stolen right in front of our eyes,” said Rep. Trey Martinez Fischer of San Antonio in an interview. “If we’re going to be the spark that lights that fire, then we’re doing our jobs.”

When House Democrats last walked out in 2021 to stop new state voter restrictions, lawmakers were on the lam for over a month before the caucus fractured and enough members returned to restore quorum. Republicans quickly pushed the measure through, but Democrats say they were successful in drawing national and congressional attention to the topic and removing some of the worst parts of the bill.
This time around, they’re seeking to block a congressional map redrawn in the middle of the decade to create five new GOP seats next year, putting them at the front lines of an issue with national stakes: control of the U.S. House for the last two years of Trump’s term.
Those implications have elevated the Texas Democrats decamped in Illinois and elsewhere, stiffening their resolve and garnering them nationwide attention and support that they hope can help sustain their movement in a way that was missing four years ago.
“It’s not, Houston, we have a problem,” Martinez Fischer said. “It’s, America, we have a problem, and we need to rise up.”
The walkout, meant to deny Republicans the quorum needed to conduct legislative business and bring the House to a standstill, has also set off a possible national redistricting war. Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom of California has promised to draw more blue seats in his state if Texas approves its plan, and national Democratic leaders are looking to reshape maps in Illinois, New York and Maryland.
The effort reflects a push within the Democratic Party, particularly after last year’s disastrous election results, to re-establish itself to voters as a party of fighters willing to meet Republicans on their level.
“We are going to match Donald Trump’s energy when it comes to redistricting,” U.S. Rep. Marc Veasey of Fort Worth said Monday. “Democrats we have shown up to a gunfight with nothing but good intentions and dull knives, and that era is over. We are not going to unilaterally disarm, and that is what’s different this time around.”

The message was reiterated repeatedly this week, with top Democrats from Illinois, New York, California and Massachusetts all joining the Texas delegation in pledging to stand up to the Trump administration, which is also pressing other red states to redraw their congressional maps in favor of the GOP ahead of next year’s midterm election.
“The Trump-Abbott gerrymander is a test case for the rest of the country,” Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin said Tuesday alongside Texas Democrats. “What Republicans are trying to do in Texas is a model for other red states to lie, cheat and steal their way to victory.”
Democrats began floating the possibility of a walkout as soon as Abbott put redistricting on the special session agenda in July at the behest of Trump.
But in discussions over Zoom and in person before the session began, they decided that the stakes of the issue hadn’t yet been communicated to the public in a way that would explain a nuclear act. Some also held out for a committee process that might allow them to temper any draft map, or for a GOP proposal less aggressive than Trump had demanded.
Then, the Republican-led redistricting committee unveiled a map last week that would dismantle several Democratic districts to squeeze out five new red seats. While Republican lawmakers said the map was drawn purely to maximize partisan advantage — which is legal, according to the U.S. Supreme Court — Democrats saw a plan that would achieve that edge by suppressing the vote of people of color in violation of the Voting Rights Act.
“The power grab by Trump and Abbott doesn’t just have the goal of getting five more seats in Congress,” Rep. Ramon Romero Jr. said Tuesday, the eve of the Voting Rights Act’s 60th anniversary. “It has another goal, a goal more sinister than that, and that is to make people believe that their vote doesn’t really matter. That’s why it’s all of our fight.”

(Lucy Lu for The Texas Tribune)
With Republicans moving to approve the map at a quick clip, the determination to deny quorum solidified among Democrats in the 48 hours before they got on a chartered plane headed for Chicago. Others made their way to Albany to meet with New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, and to Boston for a state legislative conference.
Democrats say they’re buying valuable time by walking out, drawing attention to the issue among voters and getting other blue states involved — even while recognizing that Texas’ map is likely to get passed and will need to be fought in court.
“The spotlight has been turned on,” Rep. James Talarico of Austin said in an interview. “I’m hoping this courage that my colleagues and I have shown will be contagious, and it’ll inspire other legislators in blue states to respond with their own redistricting attempts.”
Using their hotel complex as a base camp, Democrats have done scores of media interviews out of their cramped rooms and a small park off the Fox River in Illinois; hosted news conferences with federal, state and party leaders at local union halls and blue state capitols; and met with Democratic governors and elected officials from across the country.
Talarico, who is mulling a run for U.S. Senate, said he did 25 interviews in the first 24 hours of the quorum break, ranging from TV and traditional platforms to podcasts with ranging ideological bents. His TV hits alone reached 9.8 million viewers across the country, he said, not including thousands of others on social media.

Republicans appear to have more paths toward maximizing their representation in Congress in a redistricting war with Democrats. Redrawing congressional maps in the middle of the decade will be harder for the handful of blue states that have clamped down on partisan gerrymandering by handing their redistricting authority to independent commissions.
Still, Texas Democrats see the support blue state and national Democratic leaders have expressed for retaliatory redistricting as a sign that their gambit is working.
“This, I think, is well on its way becoming a national fight, and that’s what’s going to be important if we’re going to counter” the GOP, said Rep. Chris Turner of Grand Prairie, who led the 2021 quorum break.
Republicans blasted the Democrats who left, arguing that they abandoned their office and were refusing to participate in the legislative process because they did not like the inevitable outcome. Critics also mocked the contingent for seeking refuge from Texas law enforcement in Illinois, which is heavily gerrymandered in favor of Democrats.
But Democrats said that by denying the House a quorum, they were doing the very job their constituents had elected them to do and were now demanding they follow through on.
While the 2021 walkout required Democrats to do a lot of explaining to their constituents about what a quorum break was and why they were doing it, Rep. Diego Bernal of San Antonio said, “this time around, they were telling us that their expectation was that we would use everything at our disposal to try and stop it.”

Democrats also said they don’t take the decision to leave lightly. Talarico noted that there’s an abundance of GOP legislation that Democrats stay and fight against in the chamber. They reserved the most drastic option for what he framed as “direct attacks on democracy.”
“We have to love democracy, even when we lose,” he said. “But we do that because we always have a chance to win the next election. And if this happens, we won’t — and so we have to take an extreme step to stand up for our constituents and for all Texans.”

Eliot Barrengos is a reporter with Community News Service, part of the University of Vermont’s Reporting & Documentary Storytelling program.
BURLINGTON — In fall 2023, Colchester High School pitcher Zach Davis sat at a table in the cafeteria and signed a contract to pitch for his hometown Lake Monsters. 
The Vermont teen joined a growing list of baseball players from the Green Mountains to take the field for the Burlington baseball team. 
“It was around the winter or late fall of my senior year of high school. I reached out to my college coach and asked if it would be possible for me to play here this summer,” Davis said. “We gave (Lake Monsters head coach Matt Fincher) a call.”
It was a moment the right-hander had dreamed of just a few years earlier. 
“It sounds pretty cliché to say, ‘You can do what you put your mind to,’ but it is really true,” he said. “I remember coming to games — one in particular, my junior or sophomore year of high school — and I was just thinking, ‘Hey, I want to play here when I’m in college.’ So yeah, it’s a cliché, but there’s a lot of truth to it.”
He debuted for the team the summer after he graduated from Colchester High School, playing for a couple of months before heading to Bryant University, where he is now a rising sophomore.
For fellow pitcher Cole Tarrant, the story followed a similar script — minus the cafeteria. Tarrant, a southpaw also from Colchester, initially reached out to the Lake Monsters coaching staff, hoping to sign on for the summer after his first season at Hobart College in upstate New York. 
The rising junior has been coming to games since he was in Little League. 
“I remember when my grandparents brought me to a game — I was 6 or 7,” he said. “I thought, ‘Wow, this is really cool.’ It was always my dream to play baseball at a high level … It’s kind of a full-circle moment to be back out here.”
At the time, Fincher could only offer the lefty a temporary contract for the 2024 season. When injuries and departures inevitably created roster turnover, Tarrant had the chance to join the team for the full season.

After falling short of their championship aspirations last summer, both pitchers returned for the 2025 season. A couple of hours before facing the New Britain Bees last week, the pair reflected on their time with the team ahead of the Lake Monsters’ playoff start on Sunday.  
“I felt like it helped me a lot for my junior year, so I figured I’d do it again. I thought it could help me again this summer,” Tarrant said.
For Davis, the Monsters have represented the perfect place to hone his craft as a pitcher for Division I Bryant. 
“I have a lot of support, and I thank God for that,” Davis said. “I’m very grateful for my family, friends and the people that support me with what I do. Like, just for example — tonight, my whole family’s coming to the game. Family-friends are coming.”
Vermont is not necessarily known for producing top-end baseball talent. But both hurlers know that playing for the hometown team can be especially meaningful on the Little Leaguers who sit in the stands. 
“Even my parents have friends with little kids who tell me how awesome it is to come see me — ’cause they know me. I think that kind of inspires them, too,” Tarrant said. 
The Lake Monsters have not captured a championship since their run in summer 2021. For the guys in the dugout, the prospect of capturing the franchise’s second trophy in five years is, in Davis’s words, “really exciting.” 
“Some of us have been here since May, and guys have come in and out. But for a lot of us, this is the last little stretch,” he said. 
The Lake Monsters currently sit in second place in the Futures Collegiate Baseball League standings and boast a 38–19 record. 
“We have a chance to do something fun, something cool, and play baseball a little longer. No matter what happens, I love this team. I had a great time. I won’t regret anything we did this summer,” Davis said. 
Regardless of how this season ends, both pitchers feel their team is leaving a mark on baseball in Vermont. 
“They’ve been really successful here for four years now,” Davis said. “The organization’s done great on and off the field — they’ve created an environment that people want to come and watch. I only see it getting better.”

Today, only one man grows it.","On a recent July morning, Dwight Arnold stood in front of one of his Connecticut shade tobacco fields, the plants shielded from the sun by a white shade cloth, barking orders to the mix of men and local high school kids lying on the ground trying to pluck the lowest leaves on rows of 8- to 10-foot-high plants. 
It was the first round of picking for the last man growing Connecticut shade tobacco on his family’s farm — even though the farm is just across the border in Massachusetts.

An occasional look at Connecticut’s remarkable people, places and things
For over a century, cigars wrapped in light brown Connecticut shade tobacco have been considered among the best in the world and, as late as the mid-1980s, farmers from Suffield to Windsor were growing thousands of acres of it in what is known as the Upper Connecticut River Valley.
“Then the demand just kind of fell off, and one by one, they just kind of started to fall by the wayside and switched to something else,” Arnold said.
As demand dropped and the pressure to develop the land grew, many Connecticut farmers turned to an alternative: Connecticut Broadleaf.
Connecticut Broadleaf is easier to cultivate and is used as filler tobacco in many brand-name cigars. Experts say you can also grow more of it per acre, as much as 500 pounds more than shade.
But Arnold, whose great-grandfather purchased the Southwick farm in the 1870s, never stopped growing the iconic shade variety.

“There were years when we didn’t know who we’re going to sell it to, and I was only growing like 15 acres, and it was, well, let’s see if I can sell this stuff,” Arnold said.
This year, he planted 35 acres of shade tobacco because the General Cigar Co., which produces Macanudo brands, has agreed to buy it all for use in some of its premium cigars.
Connecticut shade actually comes from a Sumatran seed that was brought here around 1900, Arnold said. 
It is called shade tobacco because it grows with protection from the sun. The white cloth provides cover from the sun but also creates more humid conditions underneath it — similar to Sumatra.

Arnold and his crew of about 50 workers will do six pickings of the giant tobacco leaves; the very fine veins spreading from the stem separate shade tobacco leaves from other varieties, signaling potentially unmatched flavor. 
“Shade is so expensive to grow because it gets handled so many times. It has to be tied and wrapped as it grows up, picked by hand and then sewn together. It’s extremely labor intensive,” said Dr. James LaMondia, a soil scientist for The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station, or CAES, who has been working with tobacco farmers since the 1980s.
But the intensive work that goes into growing and harvesting shade tobacco is one of the reasons many cigar companies shifted their operations away from the upper Connecticut River Valley to Ecuador and Nicaragua, which have similar soil and climates but decidedly cheaper labor.
“They’re paying somebody for a week, probably what workers here will be paid in a couple of hours,” LaMondia said.
The tobacco grown in South America uses Connecticut seed, but it is not the same.
“They’ll say it’s Connecticut shade tobacco, but that’s misleading, because it’s basically Connecticut seed but not Connecticut grown,’” LaMondia said, adding they “produce what I consider to be a lesser quality, but a better price.”

Arduous work
It’s 10 a.m. when Arnold yells for everyone to stop and take a 15-minute break. They started at about 7 a.m., when it was cooler out, but it’s hot now — even more so under the white shade cloth where the picking occurs. The mesh covering is made of polypropylene and is designed to replicate the humidity of Sumatra, Arnold said.
The mix of veteran pickers and younger local high school kids grab a drink from a water tank and wet their heads to cool off.
Arnold, a reed-thin 62-year-old, calls them all by name.

There’s Jackson, who has picked tobacco for 40 years. Henry, who is wearing a homemade contraption that looks like a large reverse fanny pack to protect himself as he slides along the ground, has been picking for over 30 years. Arnold makes sure to check on a teenage boy who just started picking a day earlier.
The work is arduous. They slide close to the ground so they can get the leaves at the bottom of the giant plants that are ready to be harvested. They then gently place the leaves into a 4-foot-long plastic bin, sliding halfway up each 400-foot row of plants and then down the next until the bin is full. The bins are placed on “sleds” custom-made by Arnold to exactly fit the bins inside. They pull the sleds by ropes at either end.
Full bins are left at the end of the row, covered with a cloth. If the tobacco wasn’t covered, Arnold said, the sun would start burning the tobacco within 20 minutes. However, a tractor usually comes along within minutes to grab the full bins and transport them back to the barn for stitching.

At every step, the tobacco must be handled gently, because the leaves must be pristine if they are going to be used to wrap a high-end cigar.
“They can’t have any blemishes. They can’t have any leaf spots,” LaMondia said. “It’s a high-risk crop, because before you ever get anything back, you’re putting out tens of thousands of dollars to produce the crop.”
The tobacco is transported back to a barn where another group of workers uses a machine, specifically designed for tobacco growers more than 70 years ago, that is a combination sewing machine and upside down conveyor belt to string the leaves together. 
Then, they are hung from the rafters inside the barn for up to six weeks at temperatures hovering around 100 degrees.

They first turn yellow and then ultimately a light brown that is similar to the color of beach sand.
Arnold said about 2,000 pounds of tobacco leaves can be hung in the barn. Once it’s dried, it will be shipped to the Dominican Republic, where Macanudo will finish the process, including drying it even more. 
It takes more than a year from when a tobacco leaf is picked to when it is ready to be used to wrap a cigar.

A different tobacco
The faded red barns on Arnold’s farm were once synonymous with the tobacco industry here in Connecticut. Hundreds of them dotted the country roads that cross the Upper Connecticut River Valley.
But as farmers stopped selling Connecticut shade, the barns slowly started to disappear. 
The starkest example of this can be found on the road leading to Bradley International Airport, where a row of tobacco barns that belonged to the O.J. Thrall Company — at one time perhaps the largest Connecticut shade tobacco producer in the state — were torn down and replaced with a giant Amazon warehouse.
Another long-time tobacco grower, H.F. Brown in Windsor, also stopped growing tobacco, switching instead to vegetables.
“My grandfather and father grew Connecticut shade tobacco and I do miss growing it, but it just didn’t make sense anymore,” said Kathleen Martin, current president of Brown’s Harvest. 
They now grow cucumbers, tomatoes and all sorts of berries.
But LaMondia said the idea that tobacco farming is dying in Connecticut is inaccurate.
“It’s still a major crop here. Depending on the year, tens of millions of dollars worth of tobacco are sold,” LaMondia said. “There’s probably about 3,000 acres of tobacco being grown in the valley, so it’s still going strong.”
USDA statistics back up that claim.
Connecticut’s tobacco yield increased significantly from 2017 to 2022, according the most recent data available from the USDA. In 2017, 46 farms covering 2,204 acres produced nearly 3.9 million pounds of tobacco. In 2022, 44 farms covering 3,056 acres produced more than 6 million pounds of tobacco.
But LaMondia said the new “pounds” are all broadleaf. He said at one time, shade tobacco grew on more than 1,000 acres in Connecticut. All of that is now gone, except for Arnold’s small operation.
With Broadleaf, the entire plant is cut at once from the bottom and hung to dry in a barn. It is a much easier crop to cultivate than Connecticut shade and quicker to get to market.
“It’s kind of shifted and moved from shade being king to broadleaf, which is most of the acreage now throughout the valley,” LaMondia said. 
Several farmers said they admire Arnold for sticking with tradition and still growing the shade tobacco that first brought notoriety to the area’s farmers.
Arnold does grow about 20 acres of Connecticut Broadleaf just to “hedge,” but as the last man growing Connecticut shade, Arnold thinks he’s fine.
“I realized there was still some market for it, and if I’m the only one growing it, well they’re going to have to buy it from me,” Arnold said. “As long as I can supply them with some quality leaves, they’ll keep coming back to me.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2025_0722_SR_TobaccoFarm_028-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-10 05:56:18.769805

(Library of Congress)On the big hill west of town they met on hot summer nights beneath a wooden cross illuminated with electric bulbs. Purists might have said the cross should have been flaming, but at least there were the hoods and the white robes and the desperate oaths and the silly language rife with the letter “k.”
This wasn’t the original Ku Klux Klan, the secret society formed by a half-dozen former Confederate officers in 1865 to terrorize newly freed Black people and to fight Reconstruction. That first Klan had been dismantled by 1872 and its hooded leaders jailed.
No, this was a reimagined Klan, a movement that had been sweeping Main Street America in a wave of nostalgia and bigotry. What was happening at night on the big hill just outside Coffeyville was similar to other meetings held across the country, with Protestant religion and patriotic fervor masking the worst impulses of those beneath the hoods.
The meetings weren’t strictly social occasions.
The Klan was organizing, running candidates for office, and attempting to insinuate itself into every aspect of civic life, under the guise that it was doing good charitable and patriotic work.
One citizen who wasn’t buying it was A.J. Valentine.
Valentine was the 39-year-old editor of the Coffeyville Morning News who thought the Klan meetings were both absurd and dangerous. In October 1922, he announced that the News had an informant in the ranks of the local Klan.
“One of the indoor sports in Coffeyville for several months has been figuring out who are the members of the cow pasture parties, held around Coffeyville about once a week,” a Page One notice read. “These parties have created so much interest that The Morning News has undertaken to enlighten its readers about them. So beginning tomorrow morning the News will start a serial story, giving the license tag numbers of these cars that assemble in cow pastures, also the owners of the cars, as shown by the secretary of state’s records.”
It was a risky move for Valentine.
A rival editor would later note, in a 1943 local history, that what Valentine may have lacked in discretion he made up for in bravery.
“Mr. Valentine was a courageous editor,” remembered local newspaperman C.C. Drake, who had helmed the Daily Dawn — a Klan newspaper. “He opposed the invasion of the Ku Klux Klan here and created a good deal of discussion as to the identity of his Klan reporter, who ignored the secrecy of the order and boldly published many inner happenings.”
Valentine’s paper was an upstart not yet three years old, struggling against the well-established Coffeyville Journal and other publications, including by 1923 the Daily Dawn.
Valentine had been born in Louisiana, married his wife, Mary, in Missouri, and had worked there as a bank solicitor. He came to Coffeyville in 1912 to become advertising manager for the Journal and was later elected county clerk as a Democrat. The Morning News had leaned Democratic from the start, Drake noted in his local history, but Valentine was never tied to party dogma.
The summer of 1922 had burned like a torch as the resurrected Klan spread its hooded influence across Kansas, its kleagles organizing new chapters in towns big and small. It may have seemed an unusual turn for a state that had been admitted to the Union as free on the eve of the Civil War, but that had been 61 years ago, and Kansans, like just about everyone else in America, had been buffeted by change.
A world war, a pandemic, and the disorienting rush of the Jazz Age had frightened many into longing for an imagined earlier time, a fictional America where there was moral order and political stability. There was also a cancerous nostalgic yearning for a time before so many people had so many freedoms. Like the old Klan, the resurrected version targeted Black people, Jews, and Catholics.
Encouraged by the 1915 film “Birth of a Nation,” the first blockbuster, which portrayed the original Klansman as heroes and Black people and carpetbaggers as rapists and villains, Americans in the millions flocked to join the new “Invisible Empire.”
For them, the hood and robes and fiery crosses had become symbols for real Americans, an exclusive club of white Protestant men (although there was a women’s auxiliary). If old Nathan Bedford Forrest had lived to see the new Klan he would have been perplexed, because the organization claimed to revere the American flag, a symbol of union the original Kluxers reviled.
Most of the 1920s Klan members were described as solid middle class citizens, according to historian Tim Rives, who wrote a history of the Klan in Kansas City.
“The stimulus to this Klan’s creation is more mysterious” than the original Klan or the one that would resurface in the 1960s to oppose the civil rights movement, according to Rives. “Its program of Americanism, Protestantism, Law and Order, and White Supremacy (was) less definite than the simpler hates of other Klan eras. The amorphous character of the Klan of the 1920s gave it the flexibility to adjust to whatever local conditions it found.”
Coffeyville became a stronghold of Klan activity, with the local chapter of the Invisible Empire railing against the perceived lawlessness of South Coffeyville, a town a mile to the south, across the Oklahoma line. It was Prohibition, and the Klan said bootleggers from South Coffeyville were a corrupting influence. But then, it thought jazz music and teen necking parties were wicked, too.
Valentine’s Klan reporter, whoever he was, first appeared in the Oct. 11, 1922, edition of the Morning News. The writer took the tone of a society editor reporting a black tie affair.
“One of the most delightful cow pasture parties of the season was held on the big hill west of the city,” the piece began. “It was a masquerade affair, white robe and white mask completely concealing the identity of each guest. The decorations consisted of a large cross which was lit up with electric light bulbs — the cows having been removed before the fun started.”
In a ceremony called “naturalization,” an oath was administered to new members, requiring allegiance to the Invisible Empire. The initiates were required to swear they would die before divulging Klan secrets.
“The guests did not give their names to the News’ cow pasture society reporter but the following automobile tags were noticed attached to the cars that were assembled.” A list of 10 tag numbers and the names the secretary of state had registered for each vehicle followed.
“At a late hour refreshments were served,” the reporter noted.
Over the next few days, additional installments in the cow pasture saga identified more vehicles and their owners. Letters began appearing in the Morning News from citizens who claimed somebody else had borrowed their cars to attend the Klan meeting. In one case, the executive of a pipeline company said he was the owner of record for a number of company vehicles, but he couldn’t control the movements of every auto.
Some of the hoods, at least, were finally off.
Other Kansas journalists had squared off against the Klan, with Emporia’s William Allen White the most noted. But Valentine, a relatively obscure editor astride a powder keg of bigotry and popular influence, may have had the most to lose.
He certainly was among the most audacious.
But Klan influence continued to swell in southeast Kansas, culminating in the beating of a local mayor, Theodore Schierlmann. His offense? He was Catholic, had spoken out against the Klan, and had refused to rent a local hall for a Klan function.
“Reign of Terror is On,” a Morning News headline declared.
On Oct. 30, Gov. Henry J. Allen came to Coffeyville and during a speech at a local theater denounced the Klan. It was a secret order, he said, operating without benefit of a state charter as required of other social and fraternal organizations.
“We confront in Kansas an astonishing development of prejudice, racial and religious,” Allen said, as reported by the Associated Press. “It is seeking to establish the un-American idea that we can improve the conditions in the state by turning it over to a masked organization which arrogates to itself the right to regulate the individual.”
Allen, a Republican, said he had instructed the state attorney general to expel every Klan official from the state.
The organization, he said, “has taken the old Ku Klux Klan from its grave. It has set up the incredible philosophy that we require religious instruction from masked men whose characters and capacities are concealed by disguise.”
On Dec. 8, 1924, an explosion wrecked the publishing offices and plant of the Daily Dawn, the Klan newspaper. Nobody was hurt in the 1 a.m. blast, but damage was estimated at $75,000 — or about $1.4 million in today’s dollars.
“Nitroglycerine was used,” reported a Nevada, Missouri, newspaper. “Besides wrecking the newspaper plant the blast badly damaged an adjoining grocery store, a bicycle shop and a florist shop. Almost the entire roof of the Daily Dawn building was blown off and the front and rear walls were blown out. Windows for several blocks were shattered.”
The damage wasn’t covered by insurance, editor C.C. Drake said. The newspapers the Journal and the Morning News offered the use of their plants to Drake, who attributed the blast to bootleggers. Although there were various suspects over the years, there were no arrests. The paper ceased operations in 1925.
Also in 1925, the Klan was officially declared illegal in Kansas.
But the legacy of the Klan lived on, especially in places like Kansas City, where a former Klansman held office for 30 years, according to Rives. There were also at least 41 incidents of lynching of Black people across the state to 1927, and perhaps more.
Race relations in Coffeyville boiled over when a white mob of thousands stormed city hall in 1927 seeking to lynch three Black men. The men had been falsely accused of raping two white high school girls. Although the Klan was not involved in the riot, the incident had the potential to be a disaster similar to the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre, which left up to 300 Black people dead and destroyed the city’s prosperous African American neighborhood.
“The (Coffeyville) mob was driven back,” according to Geoffrey Newman in a 2013 master’s thesis, “first by Black deputies at the jail, then by armed African Americans who prevented their neighborhood from being torched. The National Guard occupied the city for five days.”
The incident was largely forgotten local history, Newman said, but deserved to be remembered.
“Coffeyville demands our attention because its activists won a victory against racism almost 25 years before the Montgomery Bus Boycott,” he argued. “Furthermore, the victory had its roots in a little-known court case that desegrated junior high schools statewide in Kansas 30 years before Brown. Yet these victories never created a national wave of change. Kansas … has remained remote from the centers of national discourse on race.”
In 1928, Valentine sold the Morning News. The paper was absorbed by the Journal the next year. In 1929, he took over as editor of a paper at Lincoln, Nebraska, and by 1940 was running a bookstore there.
Andrew Jackson Valentine died in 1966, aged 82.
His story — that of a small-town editor fighting a cultural torrent of hypocrisy and violence — is a just a minor part of the American saga. But it’s a story worth remembering, because all history is ultimately local history. What we do has meaning. Our individual acts of kindness and cruelty, our refusals to remember and our embrace of the past, imagined or actual, contribute to who we are as a nation.
Personally, I’d rather live in the America that A.J. Valentine thought was worth saving.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-10 08:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,The Woodstock Festival on the Tappan Zee Bridge,Jim Cameron | Columnist,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/10/the-woodstock-festival-on-the-tappan-zee-bridge/,I was a teenage toll collector on the Tappan Zee Bridge when the revelers from the Woodstock Rock Festival rolled up.,"Continuing our summer reprise of some older columns, here’s an update on memories of years past…
This week marks the 56th anniversary of the grand-daddy of all rock festivals… Woodstock. I was in my teens the summer of 1969, but couldn’t get off from my job to join the swarms of rock fans. But I did see most of them.
That summer I was as working as a “temp seasonal” toll collector on the Tappan Zee Bridge, joining Westchester and Rockland counties.  


Most days life as a toll collector on the Tappan Zee was a delight, as I was usually assigned to the far outside lane, also known as “the country club” because of its green vistas and views of the mighty Hudson River.
There were two things I learned in that job: how to roll quarters and how to listen to the radio. The tiny toll booths lacked air conditioning, but I could bring a fan or a radio. My portable FM entertained me eight hours a day as I listened to both the music and the FM DJ’s… a job I eventually earned at Long Island’s WLIR after college graduation.
New York’s FM stations were buzzing about Woodstock for weeks, and that Friday and much of Saturday, it seemed that every kid in the tri-state area was heading for Yasgur’s Farm. Most weekends were pretty crazy in my toll collecting job, because in those days tolls were collected in both directions… 50 cents north-bound and 50 cents coming home. (Today the toll is $6.75 roundtrip, if you have an E-Z Pass).
Busy as it was on summer weekends on that bridge, nobody expected a half-million people would show up heading to Woodstock, especially not the folks at the New York Thruway Authority. But after the rock fest was well underway, the Thruway brass realized the mobs would eventually be heading home, clogging the bridge. Because the music was expected to end late on Sunday, many of us temp-collectors worked overtime into the wee hours of Monday morning.
Late into the night we had five toll lanes open southbound, most of us enjoying some handsome overtime. However, traffic was so light, they sent us home by about 1 a.m.  But I was due back in the booth five hours later.
Of course, the music didn’t end until early that Monday morning, meaning that the usual morning rush hour carried as many burned-out hippies as it did regular business commuters. I remember one station wagon that pulled in to my toll lane, caked in mud up to the windows and stuffed with a dozen zonked-out kids.
“Hey man,” said the driver with bloodshot eyes that struggled to focus. “We don’t have any money” (to pay the 50 cent toll). “How about these instead?” That day, his Tappan Zee toll was an orange and a warm Coke.
Later that summer, after being reassigned to the New Rochelle toll barrier on the New England Thruway, I learned about the “exact change” lanes.  As folks threw their change into the basket, the coins went into a machine with rotating discs and holes the size of nickels, dimes and quarters. As the coins fell though the holes, their value was totaled and the driver could pull away.
What I didn’t know was the people threw more than coins into those baskets.
One day, while inside the booth removing change buckets, I heard a car stop in the lane outside followed by an ominous thump. Not the clinking of change, but a thump.
Imagine my horror as I watched an entire orange work its way down the change chute, hitting the rotating discs like a food processor, spewing orange juice and peel everywhere over the machinery, the buckets of coins and me.
Oh, for those days back in “the country club lane” back on the Tappan Zee!",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Tappan_Zee_1973-1024x792.jpg,,,2025-08-10 04:56:37.897872

(Austin Anthony for the Kentucky Lantern)LEXINGTON — Republican candidates for Kentucky’s open U.S. Senate seat set the tone for their campaigns ahead of next year’s primary during the state party’s Lincoln Day Dinner Saturday night. 
While the thorny primary was at the center of the evening, the influence of outgoing U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell on the party was clear. Speakers throughout the night sang McConnell’s praises, including West Virginia U.S. Sen. Jim Justice, who gave the keynote address. 
Chairman Robert Benvenuti said the party has $2.3 million on hand heading into 2026 elections. About 850 tickets were sold for the dinner, held at the Central Bank Center in downtown Lexington. Outside, dozens with Peaceful Bluegrass Resistance protested. 
Scott Jennings, a former McConnell staffer who has gained national notoriety as a commentator on CNN, was the emcee for the dinner. He opened the program with a promise to “roast Democrats” and touted wins by Republicans at the national level — particularly President Donald Trump’s second term in office. 
“They love it when we trash each other. They rejoice. It’s their only hope,” Jennings said of Democrats. “They can’t beat us, so they’re trying to will into existence a future where we beat ourselves through division and discord, but it’s not true. Whatever intra-party conversations we’re ever having, we all in this room know the true mission is to save our country.”
However, division is front and center in the GOP primary to replace McConnell. The primary is in May, a little over eight months away.
On Saturday night, the top contenders, former Attorney General Daniel Cameron, U.S. Rep. Andy Barr, Lexington businessman Nate Morris and Elizabethtown businessman Michael Farris, all fresh from speeches at the annual Fancy Farm Picnic last weekend, largely restated their main campaign points.
Morris was the last of the top three candidates to speak, but he used his remarks to respond to a question McConnell had asked at a Republican breakfast before the picnic, why “one of the candidates running for my office wants to be different” than him as the longest-serving party leader in the U.S. Senate.
“First and foremost, I don’t want to be the longest-serving anything in U.S. history,” Morris said. “That’s one of the reasons why I’m running. I think that politics should not be a career, and we know that career politicians have run our country off a cliff.” 
He then asked the crowd to think of the “career politicians” who “who stabbed us in the back” when the president came under fire from members of his party, such as when McConnell criticized Trump after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. 
“I’m seeking this seat with term limits in mind. I’m going to serve two terms, and I think that’s enough. I think that’s enough to get done what we need to get done in Washington,” Morris said, before adding that he strongly believes the U.S. needs a “full moratorium” on new immigration to the country after deporting all people in the U.S. without permanent legal status. 
Cameron opened his remarks to say he’s “not running against someone. I’m running for something.” He touted his record as the state’s attorney general and reiterated his opposition to diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and transgender women and girls playing in female sports. 
“We need an American built on merit, excellence and intelligence,” Cameron said. 
Barr cited the Democratic Party’s low approval nationwide and emphasized his record voting for Trump’s agenda in Congress, such as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act earlier this year. The congressman highlighted last week’s news that Apple plans to expand glass production in Harrodsburg, which is in his Central Kentucky district, and attributed the decision to the president’s trade and domestic manufacturing policies. 
Barr also spoke about his recently filed legislation to codify a Trump executive order that prohibits transgender women and girls playing in women’s and girls’ sports. Riley Gaines, a former University of Kentucky swimmer who has vocally opposed including transgender women and girls in female sports, is supportive of the legislation, he noted. 
“As your next senator, I will keep males out of our daughters’ private spaces,” Barr said. 
Lifetime achievement award squabble 
McConnell only addressed the crowd to give a lifetime achievement award to Cathy Bell, a longtime Republican who is now the state party treasurer and has served in other roles for decades. 
McConnell presented Bell with the surprise award during the dinner. However, the Morris campaign had been convinced the award was going to go to McConnell, who Morris has repeatedly blasted as insufficiently loyal to Trump. Morris’ campaign had asked the Republican Party of Kentucky to deny McConnell the award. 
“I think they saw the writing on the wall, and they saw that we were contrasting why he shouldn’t get that award,” Morris told reporters after the dinner. A spokesperson for the state party declined further comment about the award
But speakers throughout the evening said McConnell has contributed to the party’s dominance over the past few decades. 
“We are blessed to stand on the shoulders of those who came before us and to have the opportunity to build on the momentum for the betterment of the commonwealth and for America. We are grateful for the leaders who have laid the groundwork for our Kentucky success, especially Leader McConnell,” Benvenuti said “And Leader McConnell — thanks for never forgetting the importance of a strong state party.” 
Justice told the crowd to give McConnell another round of applause before recalling how McConnell had convinced him to run for U.S. Senate.

Darryl Rouson says he is open-minded about whether he’ll try to stay in the Florida Legislature next year by making a run for a Florida House seat.
Rouson, who turned 70 last month, has served in the Legislature since 2008 but is term-limited from running again for his District 16 state Senate seat in 2026. 
He says he is seriously considering filing to run for the House District 62 seat in Pinellas County, which will be open next year because Democratic incumbent Michele Rayner is departing to run for Rouson’s Senate seat.
“Well, it’s good to have to options, and I believe in experience plus relationship-building equals success. And I’ve been able to have great success, both in the House and the Senate, and things will take care of themselves,” he told this reporter while speaking on WMNF-88.5 FM radio in Tampa on Friday.
So does that mean he is running?
“Well, I’m weighing options, and it’s nice to have options,” he said. 
Although it’s more common for state representatives term-limited out of office to run for the more select state Senate (where there are just 40 members compared to 120 in the House), it’s not unprecedented by any means.
Last year, Melbourne Republican Debbie Mayfield won a seat in the House after being term-limited from her Senate seat (she ultimately won back that seat after it became open again when Randy Fine departed for Congress).
Brevard County Republican Thad Altman served in the House, the Senate, and then back in the House before being term-limited from office last year.
Pasco County Property Tax Collector Mike Fasano is another prominent legislator who couldn’t stay away from Tallahassee. The New Port Richey Republican served in the House from 1994 to 2002; in the Senate from 2002 to 2012; and returned to the House in 2012.
He departed from that seat a year later, when Gov. Rick Scott appointed him as tax collector, a job he’s held ever since.
Subverting term limits?
Florida voters approved eight-year term limits for members of the Florida Legislature in 1992. Some senators (like Rouson now) have been allowed to serve an additional two years due to a quirk in state law regarding redistricting.
In an apparent response to legislators who switch legislative chambers after completing their terms, now-Chief Financial Officer Blaise Ingoglia filed a resolution during the 2025 session (SJR 536) to clarify that the Constitution imposes a lifetime limit of 16 years in state legislative office — eight years max in the House, eight years max in the Senate.
There was a caveat for senators who serve reduced two-year terms due to redistricting. The measure would have gone to the voters as a proposed constitutional amendment in 2026, but stalled after being approved in one committee stop.
“Let’s stop the practice of people continually running for the same office and bouncing back and forth between chambers,” Ingoglia said on X. “Serving the people of Florida should be a privilege, and an honor, not a career.”
Redistricting issues
The configuration of Rouson’s Senate District 16 seat is being challenged in federal court by a group of voters living in both Pinellas and Hillsborough County who are represented by the ACLU of Florida and the Civil Rights & Racial Justice Clinic at New York University School of Law. They contend its design since 2022, including parts of St. Petersburg but moving across Tampa Bay into Hillsborough County, was the result of illegal racial gerrymandering.
During the trial, voters who live in Hillsborough County argued they weren’t being fairly represented because Rouson lives in St. Petersburg.
“I’ve done my level best to represent both sides of the Bay efficiently and effectively, and I think that I’ve done a pretty good job at that,” he said.
Three Democrats have already entered the race for House District 62: Kyandra Darling, Upton Fisher, and former state legislator Wengay Newton.
Darling addressed the rumors about Rouson’s potential entry into the race on Friday, issuing a statement on X saying, “I remain as committed to running and winning this race as I was on the day I declared my candidacy.” (That statement was first reported by Florida Politics).
Among the other topics Rouson discussed Friday were House Speaker Danny Perez’ memo to members calling for a select committee on redistricting congressional districts. Notably, Senate President Ben Albritton has yet to publicly comment about the idea.
“I think the Senate President is being very thoughtful and deliberate about his actions, and there’s no urgency to do this now,” Rouson said. 
“We’ve got a lifetime between now and November, when we get back for committee weeks, and we should study what’s happening in Texas and in California and the other states like New York that are intending to do some things. We shouldn’t be knee-jerk reactors to what other states are doing. We need to do what’s good for Florida.”
Published reports indicate Florida Republicans are considering a redrawing of the congressional map that could net them three additional congressional seats. Rouson is skeptical. They already control 20 of Florida’s 28 congressional districts.
“I think that the GOP should tread very carefully, because if they try to stretch their advantage too thin, it could backfire in ways that they don’t foresee right now,” Rouson said. 
“For example, if they diminish the margins for incumbent Republicans, thinking that they are safe, small shifts in the future could make districts competitive and give an advantage to the Democrats to gain more seats.”

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins came to the Iowa State Fair Saturday to compete in the Governor’s Charity Steer Show — and to announce $152 million in U.S. Department of Agriculture investments for Iowa rural development projects.
Before heading to the Livestock Pavillion to show the steer Snoop Dog, Rollins announced that 19 projects in Iowa would receive funding through USDA Rural Development grant and loan programs. The announcement was made at a news conference where she was joined by Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds and state Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig.
Approved projects include a $37 million loan for the Guthrie County Hospital in Guthrie Center to expand and renovate its facility, a $5 million grant and $39 million loan for the City of Emmetsburg to replace its wastewater treatment facility, and a $27.7 million loan to the Southern Sioux County Rural Water System for the building of new wells, a treatment plant and transmission lines in Plymouth and Sioux Counties.
“This unprecedented, coordinated rural development project will help boost the rural economies, develop rural infrastructure and encourage private investments,” Rollins said.
Reynolds celebrated the investment and thanked Rollins for working closely with Iowa, saying “during this time of uncertainty in the ag economy, I’m so grateful to have a partner that we can rely on.”

She said the new investments will make a difference in rural Iowa communities. Reynolds said when she visited the Guthrie County Hospital in May, where she signed a law aimed at expanding medical training opportunities and rural health care access, the hospital CEO had told her about how much of a difference the USDA funding would make in helping the facility continue to provide health care in their community.
Rollins said the investment is part of a larger effort from President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress aimed at “putting farmers first again,” which she said is also being done through new international trade agreements, investments in farm safety net programs and agriculture components of the budget reconciliation bill passed.
Though much of the focus on discussing the “big, beautiful bill” has surrounded the cuts and changes to public assistance programs like Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Rollins said the bill “protected two million family farms from the death tax,” increased reference prices and extended clean fuel production tax credits.
“Most of the mainstream media focused on, ‘Oh, these horrible cuts that are going to cause death and destruction across the world’ — which, of course, none of that was true,” Rollins said. “In fact, we were investing more money, Congress was, into our agriculture sector and putting farmers first.”
Some agriculture policy advocates have said the budget reconciliation bill, which cuts SNAP funding while increasing spending on farm subsidies, will further consolidate the agriculture industry and benefit wealthy farmers.
It’s the second event Reynolds and Rollins have held together this week. On Monday, the Iowa governor was in Washington, D.C. for a news conference where Rollins signed six waivers approving restrictions on purchases of certain food items through the SNAP. Rollins approved Iowa’s waiver to limit unhealthy foods available to buy through SNAP in May.
USDA also approved an Iowa waiver to implement an summer eating program for kids, called Healthy Kids Iowa, earlier in the year. The demonstration project, providing a box of food valued at $40 each month for families in need through 264 access points across the state, is an alternative to the SUN Bucks program, also known as Summer EBT, that provides $120 per child each month during the summer to eligible families that can be used at retailers accepting SNAP.
Both of these efforts are aimed at reducing unhealthy eating habits, the governor said, though hunger advocates have argued these steps make it more difficult for Iowans to access food assistance.
Rollins also spoke on her announcement in July for the USDA to restructure and consolidate parts of the agency, in part by relocating some of USDA workforce outside of Washington, D.C. to five regional hubs in North Carolina, Missouri, Indiana, Colorado and Utah.
The list has “no Iowa, but there are more announcements coming,” Rollins said. She said Iowa is well represented at the USDA, with many agency employees in the state and several Iowans in USDA leadership positions.
“The bottom line is moving the power out of Washington, returning the government to the people, and having people that are better able to serve our constituents, who are closer to them,” Rollins said. “So that is the bigger (arch), but more news coming in the days to come.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/rollins.steershow-scaled-e1754776297556-1024x705.jpg,,,2025-08-09 19:57:23.972697

(Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)ITHACA, Nebraska — President Donald Trump’s ag secretary visited Nebraska after a Saturday storm and faced questions from farmers about some dark skies facing agriculture, including a few clouds some said the administration stirred.
Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins heard about tariffs and trade in a closed-press roundtable at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln’s Eastern Nebraska Research, Extension and Education Center. 
Rollins got an inkling of the economic disruption of on-again, off-again, on-again tariffs with key trade partners for Nebraska agriculture, including Mexico and Canada, attendees said. 
She also heard some thanks from local producers for the Trump administration’s progress toward trade expansion into major markets, such as Japan, South Korea and Australia.
Nebraska delegation hosts Rollins

She was joined by Nebraska U.S. Reps. Don Bacon, a member of the House Ag Committee, Rep. Mike Flood, who leads the House Main Street Caucus, and Rep. Adrian Smith, from the Ways and Means Committee.
The four from Nebraska’s five-member, all-GOP delegation emphasized the help and benefits coming Nebraska’s way from the tax and spending cuts bill they recently passed. The fifth, U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., told Fischer he had a scheduling conflict. 
Fischer, whose family operates a cattle ranch near Valentine, talked about the importance of providing tax certainty for planning at a time of increasing costs for ag inputs.
National statistics indicate that Nebraska and neighboring Iowa lost more than 6% of their gross domestic product in the first quarter of 2025, the worst declines nationally, led by ag.
Growers voice concerns
Row-crop producers face the most difficult economic conditions after years of depressed pricing and now with tariffs added, producers told the secretary and delegation.
Rollins acknowledged that many growers may need federal help with price supports and affording fertilizer after many of them extended themselves to get through operations in another tough year.

The secretary said that’s why it was important — with the farm bill delayed in Congress — that some baseline protections for crop pricing were included in the GOP tax and spending bill Trump has labeled “big” and “beautiful.”
“Row croppers have been operating at a loss for a number of years,” Rollins said. ”That’s not sustainable.”
She and Fischer said Trump knows the issues facing farmers and ranchers and teased that his administration would act soon to offer some relief, including some help with farm labor.
“There’s a lot of risk involved in agriculture,” Fischer said. “You can’t control the weather. When you drove up today, you probably saw some corn that was stripped by the wind. 
“That’s why these safety nets are so important for crop producers, that they have that.”
Flood, who represents an eastern Nebraska district that includes Lincoln, said he has been talking with growers and bankers who say they need help to reduce the risk of defaulting on loans.
“Corn’s at $3.80 a bushel,” Flood said. “That doesn’t pay the bills.”
Boosting trade could help
Bacon, who represents the Omaha area, said that Nebraska needs to get more corn and soybeans “out the door” and that tariff uncertainty and a new jobs report concern him.
He argued that free trade is his preferred approach, and that it’s better for the economy, but he said he understands the president sometimes has to act to address trade imbalances.

Bacon said some producers tell him they will need help, and one of the best ways to help is by expanding the reach of biofuels into aviation fuel and higher ethanol blends in gasoline.
“It’s the only way you’re going to move enough corn and soybeans,” he said. “Otherwise you’re going to have a depression, and … we’re going to see it pretty squarely.”
Bacon, who is not running again for the 2nd Congressional District seat in 2026, said Trump had made enough progress slowing down border traffic that he could announce new visa efforts for ag workers.
The Trump crackdown on migrant workers has left some ag producers with a labor shortage, including in one of Nebraska ag’s good-news stories: an increasing number of dairies.
Defending Trump
Smith, who represents Nebraska’s sprawling, rural 3rd Congressional District, one of the country’s most conservative, defended Trump’s trying to get fairer deals from other countries. 
Feds say Nebraska GDP shrunk more than 6% in early 2025, led by ag

Smith has previously said he is no fan of tariffs, but that he considers them a tool in the president’s negotiating toolbox that he has used effectively to wring concessions.
Smith said Trump is dealing with the hand he was dealt. The congressman spent much of the past four years criticizing the Biden administration for letting ag trade languish as a back-burner issue.
People who served in the Biden administration U.S. Department of Agriculture have argued they prioritized trade. But Smith said more could and should have been done, as evidenced by a new deal with the United Kingdom.
He told Rollins he appreciated her “bringing attention to the challenges facing agriculture.” Bacon stressed that even in urban Omaha, one in three jobs are tied to agriculture. 
Research’s role
Fischer and Flood stressed the importance of the federal government and USDA continuing to invest in ag research at land-grant universities like UNL.

Flood said he is working with Fischer to secure the last $60 million needed to get the USDA research facility finished on Lincoln’s Nebraska Innovation Campus for 300 USDA researchers.
Rollins toured a UNL-managed feedlot in Saunders County with Derek McLean, dean of the Agricultural Research Division at UNL’s Institute of Agriculture and Natural Resources.
It was the secretary’s second trip to Nebraska and the first leg of a two-stop trip sending her next to the Iowa State Fair to join Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds showing steer in Des Moines.
Said Fischer: “Our delegation understands the importance of agriculture. We are really, really fortunate to have a secretary like Secretary Rollins. She is easy to reach out to.”

Now is the moment to take careful stock of how we’ve spent federal funds and where we should invest going forward. 
The post In the face of federal cuts, Mass. must spend transportation dollars right appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","EVERY DAY, we hear of federally funded projects being terminated as part of a troubling pivot away from equity and logic. The so-called One Big Beautiful Bill is potentially estimated to rescind over $4.7 billion in competitive grants for transportation alone – including $327 million from a grant to the Allston Multimodal Project to rework a section of the Massachusetts Turnpike. Climate and transportation sector projects are distinctly vulnerable to these terminations and funding pauses, something that brings a worrisome outlook for the future.  
Transportation contributes to almost 40 percent of emissions in Massachusetts, which highlights its interconnectedness to the climate and, ultimately, to public health. To fulfill Massachusetts’s ambitious goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, we must ensure that we spend every federal dollar we do have to move the state in a cleaner, more equitable direction.  
A new, interactive tool and analysis shows Massachusetts, compared to other states, largely making progress in spending federal transportation dollars on the right things. Using data from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, this analysis demonstrates that Massachusetts is on track, compared to baseline emissions levels before the 2021 legislation, to reduce over 2.5 million tonnes of CO2 emissions between 2022 and 2040. This is thanks to smart investments in public transit – buses and passenger rail, electrification, and active transportation modes like pedestrian, street, and bike safety infrastructure.  
This is terrific news. But in an era where the current federal government is working against climate action at every step, we need to take a deeper dive and see what more we can do.  
The analysis shows that Massachusetts could potentially reduce an additional 500,000 tonnes of emissions by 2040, and save $250 million, if roadway capacity expansion project funding is dedicated to mobility options that have emissions reducing co-benefits. 
Take Springfield, a city with among the highest rates of asthma in the country. A look at the kind of projects funded there by Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act money shows that the biggest funding – $30 million – went toward interstate highway maintenance, outpacing funding for active transportation 10 times over. 
Now is the moment to take careful stock of how we’ve spent federal funds and where we should invest going forward. The magnitude of the impact of clawed-back funds is unnerving, and, as a state, we need to look at more pragmatic ways of dealing with this imminent reality. Here are some areas where strategic thinking and decision-making could make a difference. 

The Infrastructure and Jobs Act is set for reauthorization next year, a process that will determine how much transportation money will be carved out for transportation, and how and where those monies are going to be spent. This is a real opportunity to influence priority-setting by making sure that there is emphasis on public transit, rural transportation, and multi-modal transportation systems that have clear health and climate co-benefits. 


The unmistakable correlation between transportation and climate should be reflected in how we plan and spend for our transportation networks. Measures like the Freedom to Move bill will do this by championing more public transit opportunities and providing multi-modal options for travel, rather than expanding and over-relying on traditional road infrastructure. It does so by making our dollars work better for our needs and our climate, offering a more thoughtful way of embedding climate and transportation justice considerations into the transportation project planning process. This ensures that transportation dollars are not spent on initiatives that degrade air quality and instead have emission-reduction benefits that ultimately help improve health outcomes and give us all more options for how to get around.  


Finally, we must ensure we have enough state revenue to go around to make any of this possible. Our Funding Our Future report offered concrete solutions for more sustainable funding sources, and yet only short-term measures have been taken. The MBTA is the only major transit agency in the country that does not have a designated source for capital expenditure, and Western and Central Massachusetts yearn for more direct connection to Boston. While Fair Share dollars from the new levy on income over $1 million have saved the day, its surplus is set to taper as collection estimates and expenditure caps become more accurate over the next couple of years. 

Although the federal funding landscape is far more uncertain than when the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act was passed, the Commonwealth is equipped with ways to overcome these challenges – starting by taking a clear-eyed view of what we’ve spent so far where, and how we can invest in choices that bring us cleaner air, more equitable and reliable ways to get around, and a climate resilient future.   
Reggie Ramos is executive director of Transportation for Massachusetts.

“With me in the White House,” he said in his March 14 address, “you once again have a president who will always have your back.”
Two weeks later, in one fell swoop, Trump’s Department of Justice slashed an estimated $500 million in federal funding to programs to help local and state justice initiatives, including policing, crime prevention, victim services and juvenile justice. The grants varied in size from $50,000 to nearly $30 million and included efforts ranging from a community policing program to work with teens in Houston to money for an extra investigator to help prosecutors in Oregon go after fentanyl dealers.
The cuts have emerged as one of the most glaring tensions between Trump’s rhetoric and his actions on law enforcement in the first six months of his second term. But it’s far from the only one. The result has been a complicated relationship with law enforcement groups, some of whom say the president’s actions have at times been contradictory.
Just this week, for example, the Trump administration protected the union contract for more than 4,000 Veterans Affairs police, firefighters and security guards, while canceling the contracts of almost all other workers’ unions in the agency. But on the same day, Trump threatened a federal takeover of Washington D.C.’s Metropolitan Police Department.
“The consensus from people who have expressed their opinions to me is that he’s talking out of both sides of his mouth,” said Ashley Heiberger, a policing professor at Moravian University and a 22-year police veteran.

The disconnect began on Inauguration Day, when Trump pardoned more than 1,000 people convicted in the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, including hundreds who were guilty of assaulting police, calling the rioters “hostages.” Many police unions and professional organizations criticized the move, saying Trump was putting police in danger by absolving people who had attacked officers. “Those convicted of [killing or assaulting] law enforcement officers should serve their full sentences,” said the national Fraternal Order of Police, along with the International Association of Police Chiefs, in a joint statement.
Since then, however, Trump and his Department of Justice have held themselves out as the protectors of state and local police, backing away from civil rights investigations involving at least a dozen police agencies. And police unions applauded an executive order Trump issued in April that promised, among other things, free legal representation for law enforcement agents accused of crimes in the line of duty and more local law enforcement access to military weapons and equipment.
More recently, Attorney General Pam Bondi’s office recommended a one-day sentence — with that time already served — for Brett Hankison, one of the officers involved in the 2020 shooting death of Breonna Taylor in Louisville, Kentucky. Legal experts described the move as unprecedented because the recommendation was far below the sentencing guidelines. The judge in the case ultimately sentenced Hankison to 33 months in prison.
In June, leaders from the nation’s largest police union also praised the temporary tax cut on overtime pay in Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, saying that it will help with police recruitment and retention, because overtime is an important part of compensation for many officers. The overtime tax cut lasts through 2028, according to the IRS.
But in other realms, Trump’s promises on cutting federal funding and his allegiance to his political allies has cut against the cozy relationship with police.
The administration and leaders of some of the nation’s 18,000 law enforcement agencies — particularly those in large, diverse cities — have clashed on issues like immigration enforcement and the Department of Justice’s stance against diversity initiatives.

Some local and state police officials are particularly concerned about the $500 million in cuts to their agencies and to organizations that support public safety efforts. Bondi has branded the cuts as a move to more directly invest in local and state police agencies. But some agencies are already feeling a budget crunch.
In June, a group of law enforcement leaders from around the country sent a letter to Bondi urging her to restore gun violence prevention grants, saying the money fueled initiatives that reduced homicides and other crimes, according to Reuters. So far, the Department of Justice has not changed course.
Some of the budget cuts targeted funding for police officer training and wellness, technical assistance for rural departments and other grants to law enforcement. But the biggest cuts affected other efforts — many run by other public agencies or non-profit groups — that augment and complement policing, like mental-health crisis responders, substance abuse programs, and community violence intervention.
In early July, a federal judge allowed the cuts to proceed, while calling them “shameful.” Judge Amit Mehta, in Washington D.C., concluded that the administration’s action “is likely to harm communities and individuals vulnerable to crime and violence,” but that it wasn’t within his power to stop it. “Displeasure and sympathy are not enough in a court of law,” Mehta wrote.
A staffer from the Department of Governmental Efficiency compiled the initial list of programs to be cut, according to reporting from Reuters. Justice Department officials said they were pivoting to putting the money towards programs that more directly supported law enforcement, but experts told The Marshall Project that the shift is not supported by the data.
“What’s so striking about these cuts, is that it really undermines the administration and [the Justice] Department’s stated claims to prioritize tackling violent crime, because many of the grants that we looked at were doing precisely that,” said Nicole Ndumele, a former Department of Justice deputy attorney general who now works as a senior fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice, a liberal-leaning, non-partisan, criminal justice think tank. Ndumele was part of a team that analyzed the cuts and concluded that they are likely to increase crime.
The cuts, she said, “really get to the heart of undermining everyone in America’s shared interest in living in a safe community.”

A number of the federal cuts targeted policing research, for example a $1 million grant to study whether officers who train in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu might use less force or sustain fewer personal injuries on duty. The Marshall Project investigated this concept in 2021, as it was beginning to catch on in departments across the country, and found very little empirical data on the effort.
Chuck Wexler, the executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, said that research like this is invaluable because police departments are often on their own in determining what kind of training to pursue.
“American policing needs to know what works, period. And there’s no central repository to get that information,” Wexler said. He noted that Justice Department-funded studies are often the closest thing the country has to a “Good Housekeeping Seal of approval that police departments can have in determining what training works.”
In rural Covington County in southern Alabama, another of the now-cancelled grants had been paying for a “Connect and Protect” program that paired sheriff’s deputies with mental health professionals in responding to certain calls and trained officers in crisis de-escalation. The program also set up a telehealth system so that people in crisis could be evaluated on the spot instead of hauled to jail or the emergency room.
The loss of funding has led to staff departures, and will force officers back to handling mental health calls alone, according to a spokesperson for the South Central Alabama Mental Health Center, which administers the program. “If funding is not restored, we risk reverting to a fragmented and reactive system, where law enforcement bears the burden of mental health crises, and individuals in need face unnecessary trauma, delays or incarceration,” the center said via email.
Other programs are somewhat more optimistic about weathering the loss of funding. The 30×30 Initiative, for example, is an effort by the Policing Project and New York University law school seeking to increase the proportion of women police officers in the U.S. to 30% by 2030. The effort is built on research that shows female officers use less force and less excessive force, face fewer lawsuits and are generally perceived as more trustworthy and compassionate by people affected by violent crime.
Maureen McGough, the program’s chief of strategic initiatives, said the funding cuts will limit the effort’s effectiveness, but she’s still bullish on their prospects. “I can’t overstate how much state and local [law enforcement agencies] have stayed with us,” McGough said, even as the federal government cuts funding and as federal agencies pull out of partnerships with 30×30. “I have so much faith in this current and next generation of law enforcement leaders to promote this work internally, which is where it matters most.”
Trump’s stance on policing-related issues at the start of his second term has surprised even some people who worked for the Justice Department the first time he was in office. Federal prosecutors tried to withdraw from most Obama-era investigations of police during Trump’s first term, but the Justice Department still investigated and found civil rights violations in the police department in Springfield, Massachusetts. Trump also pulled back federal grant money for policing in his first term, but people in the policing sector say this round of cuts is far more severe.
Even though many of the groups affected by the cuts are not directly embedded in local police agencies, sheriffs and police chiefs are bracing for the indirect impacts.
The Marshall Project reached out to dozens of police agencies for this story. Almost all declined to comment or did not return calls and emails.
Chief Mitchell Davis III at the Hazel Crest Police Department in a suburb of Chicago was an exception. He’s on the board of the International Association of Chiefs of Police and a past president of the Illinois Association of Chiefs of Police.
Davis said his department of 37 sworn officers has not experienced cuts yet. But most of his supplemental funding comes from federal grants handed out on the state level, so he thinks he will have to abandon his hopes to keep up with the latest advances in crime-fighting equipment.
“I don’t know anyone who’s got enough money,” Davis said of local police departments. “We all rely to some extent on federal funding, and when that is taken off the table, it’s going to hinder us.”

George McManus of Traverse City, but after an hour of shaking hands and greeting up north party fixtures, Rogers left early and never addressed the crowd.
His campaign for the U.S. Senate said Rogers was happy to be there but had another campaign event in Gaylord and that the dinner was running over time, prompting his exit. But the crowd at the dinner appeared to be visibly bewildered when it was announced midway through that Rogers was no longer there and they wouldn’t get to hear him speak, seeing as how he was one of the main draws of the evening.
Few people at the dinner were aware of any other Republican event featuring Rogers in the region that evening.
The campaign did not respond when asked about the nature of the event Rogers left to attend.
The McManus dinner, held in a sprawling conference center space at the Great Wolf Lodge in scenic Traverse City, however, started promptly at 6 p.m. as planned and concluded right around the stated 9 p.m. end time.
There was talk at the dinner that Rogers was upset because he was not speaking first – U.S. Rep. Jack Bergman (R-Watersmeet) was scheduled to speak first, and did.
Bergman told the Advance afterward that the rumor of Rogers demanding to speak first was inaccurate, and that last minute scheduling items often come up for candidates seeking important federal office.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The itinerary clearly showed that Bergman was first in the order, but Bergman made a comment at the beginning of his speech that he didn’t think he was supposed to be going first.
Still, Rogers never spoke to the crowd, first or otherwise. He and his campaign staff were present in the room for the opening prayer and pledge of allegiance, but were absent when the speaker portion began.
As the night wore on, some patrons, who were seated close to an area for the Advance and other local press, could be seen whispering to each other and repeatedly pointing to the itinerary of speakers.
Rogers and his wife created a social media video showing them at the Great Wolf Lodge on Friday, saying that the room was packed with Republicans who were fired up for the 2026 contest. It is unclear when the video was taken – before he entered the building or when he was on his way out the door.
His Facebook page, where the video was posted, did not feature a mention of another event later that evening.
Rogers did, however, post pictures from the Cops & Doughnuts location in Gaylord on Saturday morning, which indicated that he had visited the city at some point this weekend.
Dennis Lennox, a political consultant and one of the co-organizers of the event, spoke to the Advance on Saturday in his personal capacity and not as a representative of the group behind the dinner.
Lennox said that he also was unaware of any other event planned in Northern Michigan on Friday evening, nor was there an event that other attendees knew about.
Indeed, the affair on Friday was a venerable who’s who of up north Republicans, party folk from around the state and donors who attended the dinner in honor of McManus, a well-respected regional Republican senator who served in the upper chamber for a decade.
“It’s unfortunate because a lot of people came to the dinner looking forward to hearing the presumptive Republican nominee for United States Senate, and for whatever reason, did not get an opportunity to hear from him,” Lennox said. “Now, with that said, I would also, for the record, say that pretty much everybody in attendance last night is a political person, current or former, and understands that things come up and can, and things can and do happen.”
Lennox did note that the situation was odd, either way.
Still, the event continued on unabated, allowing other Republican candidates an opportunity to speak to donors and GOP faithful in Michigan’s north country.
That included gubernatorial candidate Tom Leonard and attorney general candidate Doug Lloyd, who many at the event said were the stars of the show.
Leonard says Michigan Republicans should focus more on mental health care
Leonard needed no introduction as the former Speaker of the Michigan House of Representatives, the former 2018 nominee for attorney general and a candidate for the same office in 2022.
Yet the dinner, which featured no other candidates for governor on the speaking schedule, used the address as a case for why Republicans should nominate him in the 2026 primary.
“When you look at the state of this state right now, did you know the only state that Michigan beat for population growth the first two decades of this century was West Virginia? We are currently 49 out of 50 in unemployment. We are bottom 10 for income total, and if we don’t change it, the next few years, we’re going to be 49 out of 50,” Leonard warned. “The last thing I want, the last thing anybody in this room wants, is for their child or their grandchild to come to them and say, ‘Dad, Grandma, Mom, grandpa, I’ve got to leave the state for better opportunity.’”
Although Leonard said trips to Florida for family time doesn’t sound half bad, he can’t rationalize giving up the fight and letting nearby states like Ohio steal Michigan’s future.

“We’ve got to turn this around,” Leonard said, and made a case for how he would do it.
The candidate mentioned state occupational licensure reform, which has bipartisan support in the state Legislature, to help reduce hoops for licensed professionals seeking to practice in Michigan.
On education, Leonard made another pitch for Republicans to stand steadfast behind school choice, particularly home schooling, which he said has been under attack for years.
Another issue that Leonard championed on Friday evening was expanded access to mental health care. 
That push may very well resonate with people in Traverse City following the recent tragic multiple stabbing event at an area Walmart. The alleged perpetrator reportedly had severe mental health issues that went unaddressed, and many have said that better access to care might have prevented the stabbing.
“Why should Republicans ever shy away from mental health reform? … This is something that’s been near and dear to my heart for nearly 20 years,” Leonard said. “I always ask this question, ‘why is it that we should wait for somebody to hurt themselves or hurt somebody else before we get them the help that they need?’ Republicans ought to be running on this issue.”
Leonard also said Republicans in the next cycle need to run on positivity and solutions and not on old grievances against Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer or any of the candidates seeking to succeed her.
“I talk to police officers that are overwhelmed because of this mental health crisis that is facing our state, and frankly, they don’t want a candidate for governor, they don’t want any politician, that’s going to go out there every single day dividing us, dividing others, and poking others,” Leonard said. They want somebody that’s going to listen to them, and they want something that’s going to bring real solutions to the table and solve their problems.”
Leonard concluded by saying that’s what Republicans are going to see with his campaign over the next several months.
Lloyd touts prosecutor work in Eaton County as pathway to AG’s office
The fight to elect a Republican to the attorney general’s office after eight years of Democratic Attorney General Dana Nessel is also of high priority for the GOP faithful across the state.
Lloyd, the current Eaton County prosecutor, said his experience in the office will translate well into the state’s top law enforcement position. He said that the attorney general is also tasked with protecting constitutional rights, not just prosecuting crimes, adding that it takes experience to be able to counsel the Legislature against making bad laws that could harm citizens, and to have the restraint to focus on state issues, a knock on Nessel’s push to repeatedly sue the administration of President Donald Trump on a multitude of federal policies in the opening months of his second term.

“We see local sheriffs and prosecutors who are understaffed and overwhelmed every single day as they battle to fight and continue on with the large case loads that they must carry,” Lloyd said. “But instead of the attorney general using her resources in a way that is beneficial to the state, she decides to play political games, filing suits against the Trump administration, instead of actually being a leader.”
Lloyd asked Republicans in the room to help nominate an attorney general candidate who could actually win the general election, a subtle knock against candidates in the past who lost to Nessel, which includes Leonard and former 2022 nominee Matt DePerno. 
To Leonard’s credit, his race against Nessel was incredibly close, with the Republican candidate losing by less than 3 percentage points. DePerno, however, lost to Nessel by nearly 10 percentage points.
“In 2026 what you need to understand is that Republicans must win,” Lloyd said. “We need to nominate candidates who can actually rally the party and the votes. We will need winners, not distractions.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/P8084391-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-09 15:57:11.675456

(Photo: Jeniffer Solis/Nevada Current)In agreeing to deploy the Nevada National Guard to help carry out the Trump administration’s mass deportation agenda, Gov. Joe Lombardo is “turning Nevadans against Nevadans,” said Democratic U.S. Rep. Dina Titus.
Titus was among several Nevadans who expressed harsh reactions to Lombardo’s decision.
Lombardo’s office told the Nevada Independent Friday that about two dozen Nevada National Guard personnel will be providing “administrative” assistance to U.S Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
The Defense Department late last month authorized several states, all with Republican governors, to deploy National Guard assistance with mass deportation efforts. The DOD statement said National Guard personnel would provide “case management, transportation and logistical support, and clerical support for the in- and out-processing” of undocumented people at ICE detention facilities. 
The DOD statement noted the federal government would pay for National Guard assistance.
Lombardo is the latest Republican governor to agree to the Trump administration’s overture seeking National Guard support for ICE activities.
Several states (including Florida, Louisiana, South Dakota, Tennesee, Idaho, South Carolina, and Wyoming) have so far announced or confirmed National Guard personnel will be accordingly called up, with several others poised to join them.
ICE’s tactics, which have included masked men apprehending people off the streets in unmarked cars, and detaining people with no criminal records and U.S. citizens, have been met with a barrage of criticism and scrutiny.
Immigration has consistently been Trump’s strongest issue in polling over the years. But a Gallup poll last month found 35% of respondents approving of Trump’s handling of immigration, while 62% disapproved.
At least one Republican governor has declined to authorize the National Guard.
A spokesperson for Vermont Gov. Phil Scott said due to “concern for the tactics, and disruption that some of those tactics are causing, in workplaces and communities,” the Vermont National Guard would not be called up to help ICE.
Concern about tactics and disruption were similarly cited by Nevadans who blasted Lombardo’s decision.
“The Nevada National Guard’s mission is to protect us, not sow more fear in our communities by doing Trump’s dirty work,” Titus said Friday on X.
The Nevada Latino Legislative Caucus issued a statement Friday evening saying Lombardo “has chosen Trump over Nevada.”
“He is not protecting our communities, he is helping to tear them apart,” said Democratic Assemblymember Cecilia Gonzalez, NLLC caucus chair.
“Mass deportations,” the NLCC statement continued, “will devastate Nevada’s families, our economy, and our reputation. Tourists will be scared away, small businesses will lose workers, and neighborhoods will be militarized. Children will fear going to school. Families will live in constant terror.”
The state “deserves leaders who will stand up to Washington when it threatens our values, not roll over and hand them the keys to our state,” the NLCC statement added.
Saying Nevada Republicans “have moved so far right they’re unrecognizable,” Democratic state Sen. Fabian Doñate noted that Lombardo’s most recent Republican predecessor, Gov. Brian Sandoval, ruled out calling the National Guard to help round up undocumented people when Trump made a similar request during his first administration.
The “Trump-Lombardo agenda has fractured families and already negatively impacted Nevada’s tourism-dependent economy,” said the Nevada Immigration Coalition in a statement responding to Lombardo’s decision to deploy the National Guard.
“It’s shameful that Lombardo has bent the knee to Trump,” the statement added.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/lombardo-DSC01395-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-09 13:58:46.357555

(Lynn Smith for Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The Flint Hills Trail State Park, a 93-mile path that carves through grasslands and prairie, earned an induction in the national Rails to Trails Conservancy’s hall of fame.
The trail beat out two others in Florida and Utah by a landslide, with 80% of the vote, according to an announcement from the Kansas Department of Wildlife and Parks.
“The Flint Hills Trail isn’t just a path across Kansas,” said Jeffrey Bender, a region supervisor for the department. “It’s a journey through the essence of Kansas — through the land, the cultures and the endeavors of the communities.”
The trail is one of the longest rail-trails in the United States, and the longest in Kansas. It will eventually stretch 118 miles from Osawatomie to Herington. Rail-trails are multi-use paths converted from unused railway corridors.
It is the second Kansas stretch to be inducted into the Rails to Trails hall of fame. The Prairie Spirit Trail was the first major rail-to-trail in Kansas and was added to the hall of fame in 2011 during its 15th anniversary month. The 51-mile trail connects to the Flint Hills Trail, running from Ottawa to Iola.

The Kansas Legislature designated the Flint Hills Trail as a state park in 2018. In 2020, the U.S. Department of the Interior recognized it as a National Recreation Trail. In 2022, Kansas received nearly $25 million in federal grant funds to improve more than 40 miles of trail.
Ryan Chao, president of the conservancy, said in a news release that the Flint Hills Trail “has catalyzed the state’s trail economy.” 
“This trail stands out as a prime example of how trails bring joy, provide cultural and historic connection, and deliver economic opportunity — all critical to quality of life across America,” Chao said.
  Gov. Laura Kelly says the importance of state parks can’t be overstated. (Lynn Smith for Kansas Reflector)
The conservancy advocates for the creation of rail-trails across the United States. One of its major projects includes the Great American Rail Trail, a still-in-progress path that will eventually span the country from Washington, D.C., to Washington state.
Flint Hills Trail users can walk, bike, hike and horseback ride on the trail. Portions are accessible by wheelchair.
Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly said the induction was an honor and “testament to the natural beauty of our state and the commitment of Kansans who have worked to preserve it.” 
“In addition to promoting healthier lifestyles, Kansas state parks contribute millions to the economy annually,” she said. “The importance of these parks to our state’s economic well-being, as well as to the quality of life of Kansans, cannot be overstated.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/20250804_195212-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-08-09 12:57:32.259425
